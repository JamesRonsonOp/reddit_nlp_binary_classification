I spend a lot of time being the odd person out in life and the one in the family who just thinks differently. I stand up for what I believe in, and always try to do so with the mindset that it’s very possible I am wrong and need to check myself. In my family, and often online, it’s virtually unheard of for someone to truly listen to what you are saying and understand it in the moments of disagreement.

It is important for me to always be willing to admit fault and own up to my own ignorance or mistakes. 

When I got the comment reply from the person saying that they were sorry for what they said and hadn’t considered what I was saying, I almost broke into tears. 

I’m constantly admitting to my family when I am wrong and take accountability for it, but to be shown the same back by someone else was overwhelming to me.

I know it seems really silly, but it’s the first time on Reddit and one of the few times in life I’ve been treated with that kind of respect and it filled me with hope.

So ever since when I sing in my car I do it in a lower key. But I still find myself telling people ""Oh I think I'm tone deaf"". I thought maybe I'd try a Christmas song this time around. I'm still practicing both the piano and the singing. I decided to record myself to see how bad it was. And though my strength is weak, it didn't sound so bad. I took a ""pitch test"" to see if I could hear the correct pitch. 100% correct. So I downloaded a ""learn to sing"" app and I just started the practices, but um... I'm pretty good at hitting the notes! Geezus only took me over 40 years to figure out if I just put some practice in I probably can sing alright. I don't know if I'll feel comfortable enough with the Christmas song to send it, but I'm really enjoying learning a new skill at the ripe old age of 43.

Leaving cookies and milk out for Santa is a fun tradition that kids love and keeps the Christmas spirit alive. But let’s break this down. 

There are approximately 2.2 billion children in the world. Let’s conservatively say that 1.5 billion believe in Santa, just for argument’s sake. If every child leaves one cup of milk and 5 cookies, of which Santa eats 4, that’s 1.5 billion cups of milk (1% for argument’s sake) and 6 billion cookies. 

There are 103 calories in a standard cup of 1% milk and 51 calories in a standard sugar cookie, approximately. So, that’s 307 calories per house. Let’s say, to account for siblings, there are 1.1 billion houses that Santa delivers to. At 307 calories per house, Santa ingests 337.7 billion calories in his travels. 

At 3,500 calories per pound (approximately), Santa is gaining 96.48 million pounds EVERY Christmas. This doesn’t account for if Santa eats all 5 cookies or if Santa doesn’t finish all his milk. Let’s not even talk about the calculations for the reindeer and celery/carrots.

It's that feeling when you start to get a tiny inkling of what it means to exist in such a large universe, that fear and apprehension when you stare out into the void and realize you're nothing in the endless sea of anything. It's not really like a dread type of a fear. More like awe, wonder. The world is great, massive in every fathomable way, and I don't even know why I am conscious to it.

For the past seven-ish million years that humans have been around, every single one that has seen the moon, has seen the same tidally locked face of that massive rock (with some minor liberties). It's one of those things almost all of us have done, yet over the seven million so many have considered it in so many ways. Some people don't give a crap about it, some people write songs about it, some people try to land on it. Doesn't really matter since it's always there, looming over the next horizon, changing only by course of sun and shadow. 

Everything about my existence is totally out of context to it. But it's physically, truly there. Floating in the vacuum, as stranded as any other object in space yet still kept desperately close by the confining chains of gravity. It's massive, drifting in an infinite room without floor or ceiling. I can't even consider what it's like to not have a surface beneath, above, or around myself. The only thing we have to use as reference are the other massive things that just drift about in our universe. I got like a freaky feeling in my legs when I realized that. Vertigo. Kinda glad there's gravity to keep me down lol. 

My life is too short to even possibly understand how old it is, how long it's been floating there. I'm too tiny to conceive how big the moon is too. I can only understand it from 400,000 km away, and I can hardly even consider *that* distance in the first place.

Like legit close. But then I went to university and then they suddenly stopped talking to me or inviting me to things once we would be in the same area. 

Before in high school we would all chill together and usually I would invite everyone even if we weren’t that tight but were in the same social circle. And now 3 years later now that we are all back home because of covid, it’s like I am the only one they cut ties with. They all still chill and go out and have house parties. And the same people that would kiss my ass now don’t even bother sending an invite. This has left me kind of sad and confused because I do not know what I have done to make all of them cut ties with me so sudden when all of them still chill together. I would understand if I had done something but I guess it’s cuz of my personality? But then how were we friends back in the day. I don’t know I just feel used because now that this is pretty clear, I just feel kind of in a confused state and has left me wondering if I should continue making friends or just leave it. Some people aren’t meant to have friends I guess. 

Reason I think this is true because I legit have lost all friend groups. Even the people that are “nice and are friends” don’t call me to things.

Got my number 1 job offer, accepted and all, and this summer after I graduate from college I’m moving across the country to start my own life in an awesome city

Parents and family seem to be super proud of me and excited for me. All of my friends are super happy and excited for me also. It’s very comforting and reassuring to see my circle happy to see me succeed and see my hard work pay off. Everyone appears to be genuinely happy and excited for me. 

80 days clean off weed. I passed my drug test a few weeks ago for the job and can smoke again if I want, but I really am better off without it. I’m happy and content with this sober life. Weed was something I struggled with for a while so I’m happy to have broken away. 

For the first time (seemingly) ever, I’m excited for the future. I can finally take a deep breath. All of my worrying, stressing, anxiousness and self-doubt over the past four years kicked my ass; but now that in hindsight it was a part of this process I can appreciate it and the growth it’s caused in me. I can actually enjoy winter BREAK and not be super stressed and spending 10 hours a day applying to jobs with my parents up my ass about it.

One more semester of university and then it’s off to the real world. I’m excited and for the first time in my life I feel confident and ready. Still feel so unfathomably grateful to my parents for giving me every opportunity to succeed. I work hard to validate their sacrifices. Even tho I’ve reached a point where I don’t do anything to gain their validation, I still want to make them proud like any child does.

I am happy to be able to look at myself in the mirror and honestly feel like I’m reaching my potential. While I’m happy to be where I’m at, the work is just beginning. Time to step on the gas even harder. 

I hope everyone’s doing well. If you’re not, know that better days are coming.

From about age 19 to up until a year ago I battled with serious alcoholism and depression. I went into a drug my fifth drug treatment in November last year and graduated my sixth earlier in august this year. I am doing incredibly well since then. I’ve moved away from the isolated mountain I was living in to a big city in the NW. I live in a sober house that’s comfortable. I’ve got a good paying job. I have a car, a phone, etc. 

Most importantly, for the first time in about a decade in actually happy and clear headed. It’s kind of hard to explain, but having this alcoholism/depression problem was such a major blow to both my mental health and my physical health. Even if I went a week or two without drinking I would have chronic headaches and the most bleak outlook on life. For that whole time everything seemed dull and gray, and it felt *impossible* to achieve anything. I was afraid to get out of bed. Afraid to talk to anyone, and it was painful the whole time. It was terrible, and I can’t believe I spent such a long time doing it. 

Cutting out alcohol and marijuana from my life may have been the best thing for me, as well as finding a purpose (having a job). I honestly feel like a completely different person and the possibilities are endless! The only thing that gets me down is that I could have spent the past ten years doing what I’m doing now, building up my life. I could have had a career and a house and everything. Oh well. 

What I’m getting around to now is that through that whole time of depression and alcoholism I was single. I had a girlfriend in high school and it kinda ended bad and my therapist and I have identified that as the catalyst for beginning of my deep dive down into depression. 

Now that I’m happy, I want to be with someone. Like, really bad. Like, I’m falling in love with almost any woman I see. It’s like a primal instinct. My instincts are telling me I need a mate. It’s sometimes all I think about. I daydream about it. I stare out the window and think about it. When I’m having breakfast I imagine what it’d be like cooking for a girlfriend. 

My problem is that one of my main symptoms of the depression I had was extremely low self esteem and self worth. I’ve been trying to improve that but it is so difficult. No matter how many times I tell it to myself, I just don’t think I’m *worth it*. I mean, I’m starting to come around. I think I’m pretty great. But there’s still that voice that says “no, better not bother her.” 

So I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to find the courage to start dating. Friends tell me that I seen like more of a “find them in the wild” type of guy instead of online dating, whatever that means. 

Just last night I was grocery shopping and I was in an aisle with a young woman, just me and her. We were both shopping for ice cream. Of course my brain is giving me the signal, “potential mate! Potential mate! Engage!” and of course I do nothing. She looked like she was in a kitchen uniform, had probably just gotten off work like me and didn’t want to be bothered. But aren’t those moments good times to approach someone? If that’s what my friends are saying....
I guess I could have asked what type of ice cream she was looking for or something, but to be honest with you my social anxiety has gotten so bad lately that every time I try to speak to someone out loud I just get a weird mental block and my words some out like mush. 

So I’m just posting this looking for advice/words of encouragement. I don’t really have anything to lose talking to a woman in public but I just can’t get up the courage to do it. I think I’d be a good boyfriend and the thought of getting to know someone else is so exciting. Plus I haven’t been intimate with someone in over ten years. Snuggling while watching a movie sounds like heaven. I was even (not seriously) thinking of going nearby to a rough street in my city and looking for a prostitute who would just cuddle with me for an hour. There are “professional cuddlers” in my city so I’ve been considering that. It’s a legit service. Not illegal and actually sounds like something I would like.
