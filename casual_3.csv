I graduated college at the age of 20.

Reflecting on this has been so weird. I genuinely couldn’t tell you what I gained from the last 5 or 6 years. I started volunteering and working in the field I wanted, and that has allowed me to learn everything I know today. The vast majority of things I learned in college were things I already knew, and they didn’t really expand upon it. Most of the time, I felt underwhelmed because they didn’t even match what I knew.

I think this is probably because I had two really good mentors at work who allowed me to take responsibility early on and help me when I had questions. But it’s crazy that two mentors who did not have college education in tech were the ones that got me where I am now. I have a pretty good job at a growing tech startup that I do very good at.

I’m quietly confident, able to defend myself if necessary but also a nice person  I’d like to think.

Most girls/women I think at least occasionally look in the mirror and think “I look good today” or look forward to getting dressed up and feel good about themselves. I can’t imagine what that’s like. I wear makeup and get “dressed up” just out of necessity. I have never once looked in the mirror and thought that I look good. I have never hit on anyone or expected it from anyone else because I believe I’m too ugly and disgusting. It’s literally ingrained in my mind and I’ve just accepted it. I can’t think any other way.

I never usually get negative comments from people about my appearance but if I do I honestly don’t care, it doesn’t bother me at all because it’s just a fact. If I receive a compliment (also very rare) its embarrassing because I feel like the person feels sorry for me and is trying to make me feel better. 

No I don’t believe I have body dysmorphic disorder, I’m not overweight, I exercise, eat well and work full time in a job I don’t mind. I wasn’t bullied as a child.

Over 2020, bc I can't go out and party and distract myself with the usual stuff, I've really gone on an education binge - lately I'm constantly filling my stupid brain with news, history, cultural studies and especially science.  With every new thing I learn, though, I've been feeling like it makes me a little more miserable, and ruins things that use to make me happy.  For example:

I can't enjoy a lot of cute animal videos because I know the animal is acting ""funny"" because it's terrified or the behavior is caused by some injury/mistreatment.

I am appreciating a sunny day in december, and realizing it's been 15° above the historic average for my area and I think about climate change

I go get a cup of coffee, but I'm aware that my favorite coffee shop buys from a distributor who undercuts local coffee farmers by using *basically slave labor

And those kinds of over-thinking (but true) thoughts have been consuming me a lot lately.  The other night I couldn't sleep and I was raking around my brain in a panic to focus on SOMETHING that didn't make me sad or worried so I could fall asleep.  I finally found the subject, and it's my friends.  I know, lame lol.

I’m beating myself up pretty bad about this and honestly I think I’m looking for reassurance that I *do* suck.

My fiancé and I have been having a bit of trouble with my engagement/wedding ring situation. I want to do the traditional thing and wear a wedding ring in addition to my engagement ring. The issue is, my engagement ring is broken. We’ve been looking for months for a suitable replacement and occasionally I’ll find one that I really love, but it doesn’t look like the ring he bought for me so I just categorize it as a pipe dream and move on which over time has kinda beaten me down. A lot of similar looking rings have either been too expensive, not similar enough, or have bad reviews (we can’t afford to go to a jewelry store so we have to shop online). Originally when this issue came up he suggested I just wait until the wedding and after that just wear a plain wedding ring. And logically I know that’s what makes the most sense and I guess I’ve been trying to beat myself down far enough to be happy with that... but today I think I reached my boiling point while looking at Etsy because it just kind of hit me that I’m a giant sack of shit: he doesn’t want to spend the extra money on a replacement ring, he doesn’t see the point to it and I guess it is pointless so why am I so adamant on doing this? Then the other part of my brain says that I’ve compromised enough already by having a maid of honor and best man, by not doing engagement photos, by not having bachelor/bachelorette parties, not having a registry, he didn’t have much time with his work schedule to help plan the wedding so I ended up planning the entire thing myself while just asking him to choose the things he specifically wanted, so why is it so wrong of me to want this one thing? I’m not trying to keep score or anything, I’m just typing out what my train of thought was. But maybe it’s stupid of me to want this anyways I guess. And it’s not like he isn’t supportive or he’s telling me what to do or something.

How do you go about structuring them? I can't believe I'm saying this but over the last few years I've found myself talking about certain ideas and thought ""my god, I'd love to have written an essay about this in school"" 

I was quite good at writing essays in school. And in the last few years I've read essays fans have written about certain movies, TV shows, music and found the way people explore the ideas to be fascinating. I'm going through therapy and learning to explore my own emotions and it has me wanting to explore some of the ideas presented in media to help me better understand and internalise some of the themes and possibly apply them to my own life. 

But I'm 25 now, it's been a long time since I wrote an essay. So I'd struggle to know how to begin. 

I've always fancied myself as a writer so maybe if I did enough of them I could start up a blog or something, who knows. 

I'd love to hear from anyone who does this, or has considered doing it. What have your written about? What would you like to write about? 

For me, conversation that inspired this post was a conversation about Tyler Durden from fight club, and how whilst some of his advice is very worthwhile, a lot of it is self destructive. The takeaway being the more the narrator listens to Tyler, the more prominent Tyler's character becomes, and thus, the more he ruins the narrators life. I could go into more depth but that's not the point of this post!

I was the youngest in the office working the role I was, and so I always felt a little like a kid trying to sit at the adults’ table. But now I’ve been here for 6 months, and my coworkers have left me Christmas gifts and cards and called me to tell me how much they appreciate my being here and being positive during the chaos of 2020. Those little gestures mean a lot. 

I guess what I wanted to also say, you know, is if you’re working from home or if you were forced back into the working world, or maybe if you aren’t working but you have people you talk to frequently, make sure to drop them a line. Send them a little card for the holidays—even if it’s just a piece of printer paper with colored markers and a doodle-reindeer or star or something. Heck, a cute gif over messaging with maybe a link to a kind YouTube video, even! Any little act of kindness goes a long way, and I dunno, seeing my office kind of reach out and make me feel welcome has really touched me today.

But yesterday I was finally able to see him. He started crying, I started crying. The whole thing. But after that, I showed him pictures and gifs of one of his favorite characters in Adam Sandler movies, Rob Schnieder. Haha we always told each other “you can do it!” So while I showed him, he was able to smile and even laugh a little bit. 
I hope it helped him. I hope he was able to feel like himself in that regard.
