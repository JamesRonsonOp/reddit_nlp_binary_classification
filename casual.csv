5,CasualConversation,"Me and my friend were friends for six years. But I always felt that there was something missing from our friendship, we didn’t used to go out together or even have the same things in common. But I thought that was just how it was supposed to be and continued. But this year I realised that I would rather have no friends than continue to be her friend. 

I would always give her advice on her life, yet she would never ask about mine. She was never interested in my things, and even though I wasn’t into her things either, I always tried to do it with her. I always offered to help her with homework or whatever she had trouble with at school, yet it would take a lot of my asking for her to finally “help” me with mine. A few weeks ago, I asked her to go out with me just for a small dinner, because I was feeling lonely and sad and she said that we shouldn’t because of the pandemic, but she worded it in a dismissive way that I wondered if she was using it as an excuse. Nevertheless, I realised how true this was and stayed home, she was out with someone else two days later and even when I asked her about it - she pity invited me. Then I finally stopped responding to her messages all of a sudden and now it has been almost two weeks, yet I haven’t received a single message or text asking what happened. 

So I don’t have any friends anymore, but I think I would rather realise my worth than waste my time on such a person.",I realised my friend wasn’t good for me,1608411368

I freaked out and forgot to close Twitter, so I just gave the phone to her. When she ended the call, the Twitter photo popped up, and she awkwardly handed me my phone back.

I finally did it today and got quite emotional. 2 hours later my little sister came into my room asking if I was ok. I said yeah feeling much better after cooling down. Then she hugged me and kissed me on the cheek, also pat my head which is super unusual considering she hates doing that to other people but knows that I really like it when someone does that to me.

9,CasualConversation,"I’ll (20M) try and keep it short. I live in South Africa (I wasn’t born here though) and from a young age most of my friends are white, this being because I experienced xenophobia first from black people and ended up hanging with the white kids (hadn’t experienced racism at that stage yet so I was happy regardless of the difference in color)

I started experiencing racism a lot more in high school and that coupled with the xenophobia hasn’t helped me a lot in terms of self confidence and self love but I won’t go into that. 

With everything that happened in America this year I really got serious about defending myself as a black man in a world where people are going to judge you by the color of your skin.

Yesterday I reconnected with an old friend from high school, I got his number and only remembered I got it an hour ago. I sent him a message saying “Hi” and I got a voice note back where it seems like he’s out partying and is with another of my old friends (acquaintance really) and basically this voice note went along the lines of “Hey you kaffer, do you remember me?”

For those who don’t know, kaffer is essentially the derogatory word black oriole were called during apartheid in South Africa (some would say the ‘N’ word for South Africa).

This broke my heart really, I wanted to play it off cool but just ended up ignoring he message and deleting this friend’s number because he clearly stood by and let him say this. 

Racism and xenophobia have ruined a lot for me, but I don’t know how to just, well handle it. It’s always going to be there, this I know, but it genuinely chips away at me every single time, especially when it’s people I know and thought were cool.

I don’t know who to tell but I wanted to share because I thought it was just the cutest thing and it brought me some happiness in these times that was much needed. He was too shy to say hello to me, the mom said he’s shy when talking in English, but I waved hi to him and said thank you.

16,CasualConversation,"So I really like teal eyeliner, specifically I use: Shea Moisture Ultra Smooth Long Wear Eye Pencil in teal. And I only wear this on my waterline because I just like it there but it isn't a waterline pencil. I haven't found a waterline pencil in a similar color.

Does anyone know of similar color for waterline, or any that could be mixed to create that color? 

We can get a bit deeper and go into why I wear: teal makes brown eyes more noticeable, of course depending on the brown and teal variations. Also, simple routine because it genuinely helps with my mental health on a basic degree.

Random insert: I'm stretching my ears, have tapers and weights, but any advice on how to go about it better is appreciated.

19,CasualConversation,"I received a record player as a gift a couple of days ago and last night my dad gave me all his records since he was in high school. Around 50 albums, mostly folk and classic rock. He doesn’t have anyway to play them anymore, so I say in the floor going through the box and he told me stories: how he had to wait to play his Rolling Stones album until his parents weren’t home, how he accidentally stole a square dance album from the library, which of his 5 CCR albums were the best, etc.  

This box of records is now one of my favorite things I own. It feels like I’m listening to my Dad’s memories, like I get to have these prices of his past to listen to anytime I want. I grew up with CDs which I’ve mostly thrown out or given away, and now I mostly just steam music. It is really amazing how I can listen to anything I want from any genre whenever I want to. But when I’m 70, like my dad, will I be sitting my daughter down and telling her all the stories and memories that go with my Spotify 2020 wrapped playlist ? Probably not.

Since Reddit has a lot of skeptics(which is a good thing), I learned to only comment factual information and to have reliable sources to back up any claims.

I’ll start. I think it’s a combination of both and that there are certainly cases where someone’s success was the result of dumb luck.

Say there are two pills invented. One pill you take once a day and it gives your body and mind the same benefits of a full nights sleep and you stay wide awake. You never have to sleep on this pill.

Do you take one and which one?

The rest pill gives you the ultimate time for hobbies, making extra money, learning about the world, video games, and any other activity you do not seem to have time for.

However, if I was the friend who got the help, I would be in some debt to the person (unless he truly makes me feel weird whenever he always mentions that he put me to where I am at today). If that would be the case, I would just quit the job, because I do not want my friendship to be ruined. Anyways, what are your opinions on this?

He has ADHD, mild aspergers, tourettes and generally struggles mentally. He lives alone (he's an adult in his late 20's), and this year he moved 6 hours away. Since he isn't confident in driving that far to come home for Christmas, he decided to celebrate with a friend instead. 

I know you probably think it's strange that I'm so happy about this, but hear me out. He is a professional nagger and complainer. He constantly calls my parent for help and advice with anything and everything. The smallest inconvenience he has to call my mom (who has chronicfatigue syndrome btw). Even though he has social workers that can help him. If its not help he needs he just calls to complain and vent about how tired he is or something ""actually normal"" that concerns him. He always has something to be upset about. He is **incredibly exhausting to be around**

Every Christmas he manages to be the center of attention. Whether it's because he's in a bad mood and constantly complains to my mom, or when he's in a good mood and the conversation is still about him, he literally will not shut up. EVER. If I try and enter the conversation he always finds something to tease me for. So for the first time in my life I'll have a Christmas where I can get a word in the conversation, and I can have some goddamn peace without him constantly yapping in the background. 

I know it will be phone call hell for my mom and stepdad during Christmas but at least he's not here physically...

Not until I dated my ex has anyone ever said to me ""Actually you're not too bad, you just sing too high for your voice. Drop the key and you'll sound much better!"" So ever since when I sing in my car I do it in a lower key. But I still find myself telling people ""Oh I think I'm tone deaf"". I thought maybe I'd try a Christmas song this time around. I'm still practicing both the piano and the singing. I decided to record myself to see how bad it was. And though my strength is weak, it didn't sound so bad.

I'm pretty good at hitting the notes! Geezus only took me over 40 years to figure out if I just put some practice in I probably can sing alright.

61,CasualConversation,"Here are some facts:

Leaving cookies and milk out for Santa is a fun tradition that kids love and keeps the Christmas spirit alive. But let’s break this down. 

There are approximately 2.2 billion children in the world. Let’s conservatively say that 1.5 billion believe in Santa, just for argument’s sake. If every child leaves one cup of milk and 5 cookies, of which Santa eats 4, that’s 1.5 billion cups of milk (1% for argument’s sake) and 6 billion cookies. 

There are 103 calories in a standard cup of 1% milk and 51 calories in a standard sugar cookie, approximately. So, that’s 307 calories per house. Let’s say, to account for siblings, there are 1.1 billion houses that Santa delivers to. At 307 calories per house, Santa ingests 337.7 billion calories in his travels. 

At 3,500 calories per pound (approximately), Santa is gaining 96.48 million pounds EVERY Christmas. This doesn’t account for if Santa eats all 5 cookies or if Santa doesn’t finish all his milk. Let’s not even talk about the calculations for the reindeer and celery/carrots.

My high school career was marred by problems and I graduated something like 689 out of 702 kids. I just didn't give a damn about schooling before I decided to go back this year.

I got a 189 out of 200 on my final paper (which was six pages long on a topic of our choosing, I picked Internet Security and Privacy laws)  and with that grade, I got a grand total of 96.11% on my first college class and my first ever A in school.

It's that feeling when you start to get a tiny inkling of what it means to exist in such a large universe, that fear and apprehension when you stare out into the void and realize you're nothing in the endless sea of anything. It's not really like a dread type of a fear. More like awe, wonder. The world is great, massive in every fathomable way, and I don't even know why I am conscious to it.

For the past seven-ish million years that humans have been around, every single one that has seen the moon, has seen the same tidally locked face of that massive rock (with some minor liberties). It's one of those things almost all of us have done, yet over the seven million so many have considered it in so many ways. Some people don't give a crap about it, some people write songs about it, some people try to land on it. Doesn't really matter since it's always there, looming over the next horizon, changing only by course of sun and shadow. 

Everything about my existence is totally out of context to it. But it's physically, truly there. Floating in the vacuum, as stranded as any other object in space yet still kept desperately close by the confining chains of gravity. It's massive, drifting in an infinite room without floor or ceiling. I can't even consider what it's like to not have a surface beneath, above, or around myself. The only thing we have to use as reference are the other massive things that just drift about in our universe. I got like a freaky feeling in my legs when I realized that. Vertigo. Kinda glad there's gravity to keep me down lol. 

My life is too short to even possibly understand how old it is, how long it's been floating there. I'm too tiny to conceive how big the moon is too. I can only understand it from 400,000 km away, and I can hardly even consider *that* distance in the first place.

And now 3 years later now that we are all back home because of covid, it’s like I am the only one they cut ties with. They all still chill and go out and have house parties. And the same people that would kiss my ass now don’t even bother sending an invite. This has left me kind of sad and confused because I do not know what I have done to make all of them cut ties with me so sudden when all of them still chill together. I would understand if I had done something but I guess it’s cuz of my personality? But then how were we friends back in the day. I don’t know I just feel used because now that this is pretty clear, I just feel kind of in a confused state and has left me wondering if I should continue making friends or just leave it.

78,CasualConversation,"So I've come across a very intriguing concept about art and creation in life. I've always seen people in groups and cliques in highschool. The athletes, smart, dumb, freaks and druggies just an observation. I've been an outcast myself due to some mentall illness and lack of motivation to socialize so I've noticed these things. 

Anyways dr phil was saying in a joe rogen podcast how someone said the strange theater kids in highschool are the talents ones. Is it just me or did everyone have that group of kids? They're smart eccentric and typically in what's called a troupe. I knew one girl in our hs troupe which there was only like 20 kids out of over a 1000. They'res like the main few and I started loooking on they're social media and woah I'm amazed. 

I made an Instagram and followed this girl who was in the troupe. Even though you can't tell much from captions I just got a wierd feeling. Like something felt different not really good or bad, but interested me. I stalked her twitter and her and her friends are out there idk how else to say. 

The sheer expression of these kids is beyond me.. I can't tell if they're trying to be eccentric or truly are and it doesn't matter. I admire the expression even though they're mainly sarcastic sometimes outspoken on issues. I feel like some of them are trying to be eccentric and find it cool to be weird I guess. Hate to judge anyone like that, but there are some who make it obvious. They're just Fans of quirkiness and the arts is all maybe I am too idk. 

Reminds me of lou reed mad at jim morrison saying he was ""trying to be artsy"" douchbag lou. Anyhow, 

I just haven't had structure in my life or money and my family has always put be down for being myself. Perhaps I admire those kids because I don't see much of what I lack for them. It's made me more mature and experienced, but I'm terrified to express myself like they do.

80,CasualConversation,"So I've come across a very intriguing concept about art and creation in life. I've always seen people in groups and cliques in highschool. The athletes, smart, dumb, freaks and druggies just an observation. I've been an outcast myself due to some mentall illness and lack of motivation to socialize so I've noticed these things. 

Anyways dr phil was saying in a joe rogen podcast how someone said the strange theater kids in highschool are the talents ones. Is it just me or did everyone have that group of kids? They're smart eccentric and typically in what's called a troupe. I knew one girl in our hs troupe which there was only like 20 kids out of over a 1000. They'res like the main few and I started loooking on they're social media and woah I'm amazed.

The sheer expression of these kids is beyond me.. for awhile I couldn't tell if they were trying to be eccentric or truly were I'm still not sure and it doesn't matter. I admire the expression even though they're mainly sarcastic sometimes outspoken on issues. I'm intrigued by troupe kids and I feel like some of them are trying to be eccentric and find it cool to be weird I guess. Hate to judge anyone like that, but there are some who make it obvious. They're just Fans of quirkiness and the arts is all maybe I am too.

Reminds me of lou reed mad at jim morrison saying he was ""trying to be artsy"" douchbag lou. Anyhow

I just haven't had structure in my life or money and my family has always put be down for being myself. Perhaps I admire them because I don't see any of that for them. It's made me more mature and experienced, but I'm terrified to express myself like these kids.

81,CasualConversation,"So here is the situation. Senior year of high school there was a new person that transferred from Mexico. I didn’t really notice him at first but I was trying to make friends because two schools had merged that year and there was plenty of new people to meet. So anyways I was with an old friend of mine and he was just sitting in the corner by himself and I started making conversation with him. His story reminded me of my dad’s story of how he came to the states. So I thought that was admirable. Later I didn’t really try to talk to him even though we had the same class together. I kind of forgot about him. Later on he was like “why are not talking?” and I kind of remembered that he was that guy. So anyways I didn’t really start trying to be close to him until I saw that my girl friend was friends with him. So I was kind of jealous I guess because I’m very possessive with my friends. (Bad I know but I don’t act on it) So yeah I was trying to force a friendship. It wasn’t organic to say the least. It was weird. I build him up as someone that had all these good qualities because he was kind of like my dad and my friend also liked him. Although she did admit that she would date him if he wasn’t in a relationship. Me I was always just confused. I would ask myself “why do I feel this way” “He not even that handsome or smart” “why do other people like him, anyways?”",Y’all ever forced yourself to like someone?

82,CasualConversation,"Let me just say I don't know much about boxing. 

But I hate Floyd as a person. I respect him and he is without a doubt a very if not the most talented boxer or greatest there has been so far.

I just hate his character. But I kind of understand it as well. I mean you can't have a humble attitude if you want to be the best at something. You have to be a beast and show no sympathy.

I used to have a so so opinion about him until I started to look into him more. I decided to try to get my mom a cameo from Kevin from the office on her birthday and guess who's on cameo charging $1000 per vid (I think that's the amount). Out of bordem I decided to look at his cameos and it is the most laziest and repetitive shit. I feel so sorry for the people and companies who pay for his video.

Anyways I'm no fan of jake paul either. He does get alot of well deserved hate but If I had to have dinner with him or Floyd I would choose paul as he seems more humble and human even though none of them really are lol.

So Paul has a 5% chance and I'm trying to see what people who actually know about boxing think. I might bet on paul just for fun and if he does win I could make some cheddar lol.

So what do y'all think?","People who know about boxing, Do you think Paul has a chance against Mayweather?",1608490877

85,CasualConversation,"Today my wife and I went searching for a shirt for me for our Christmas pictures. We were searching through a store and found a bunch of good options, but every time we looked for my size we were only finding 3XL/4XL. 

This searching went on for about 10 min or so until I looked up and realized we were in the Men’s “big and tall” section. I started laughing to myself and my wife looked over and asked what I was laughing at. 

“We’ve been looking in the big and tall section this entire time!” I said

She started laughing at this point as well and said “that’s so funny! You’re not tall!”

At this point I gave her a shocked look and we kept laughing. At this point I could tell that she didn’t realize that she had just double roasted me. 

1) implying that I was short
2) implying that I was big

After I explained what she just did, she kept laughing to the point of crying in the store. 

We eventually found our way to the regular size clothing and found a shirt, and left with a very funny memory",My wife roasted me without noticing,1608490798
86,CasualConversation,"I started a new job as a real estate agent in NJ. I was very excited and it helped me with my anxiety and depression. But my husband and I just moved to NJ and I don’t know a single soul besides his coworkers. I am supposed to sell houses and help people find a new home but I don’t know anyone. I signed up for a casual volleyball group but it got cancelled due to Covid. I work another job from home so I am by myself most of the time. My husband asked me today when I am going to start showing houses and it kind of ruined my day. I feel like a failure and I don’t know how to grow my business or get my name out there. My family (out of country) and friends ( in different states and out of country) are supportive and I am very grateful but it doesn’t help to grow my business in NJ. I don’t know what else to do... I feel so discouraged. I am also not a super outgoing person. I am not shy but I have a hard time keeping a conversation alive if the other person is quiet, too. 

Any ideas? I already walked my neighborhood and introduced myself to some of my neighbors. I called some random strangers but didn’t really make any connections. Often I feel like people think I only reach out to get their business which is not true. I don’t want them to feel that way so I sometimes don’t mention anything about real estate.

91,CasualConversation,"So, I am a 28yo male. From about age 19 to up until a year ago I battled with serious alcoholism and depression. I went into a drug my fifth drug treatment in November last year and graduated my sixth earlier in august this year. I am doing incredibly well since then. I’ve moved away from the isolated mountain I was living in to a big city in the NW. I live in a sober house that’s comfortable. I’ve got a good paying job. I have a car, a phone, etc. 

Most importantly, for the first time in about a decade in actually happy and clear headed. It’s kind of hard to explain, but having this alcoholism/depression problem was such a major blow to both my mental health and my physical health. Even if I went a week or two without drinking I would have chronic headaches and the most bleak outlook on life. For that whole time everything seemed dull and gray, and it felt *impossible* to achieve anything. I was afraid to get out of bed. Afraid to talk to anyone, and it was painful the whole time. It was terrible, and I can’t believe I spent such a long time doing it. 

Cutting out alcohol and marijuana from my life may have been the best thing for me, as well as finding a purpose (having a job). I honestly feel like a completely different person and the possibilities are endless! The only thing that gets me down is that I could have spent the past ten years doing what I’m doing now, building up my life. I could have had a career and a house and everything. Oh well. 

What I’m getting around to now is that through that whole time of depression and alcoholism I was single. I had a girlfriend in high school and it kinda ended bad and my therapist and I have identified that as the catalyst for beginning of my deep dive down into depression. 

Now that I’m happy, I want to be with someone. Like, really bad. Like, I’m falling in love with almost any woman I see. It’s like a primal instinct. My instincts are telling me I need a mate. It’s sometimes all I think about. I daydream about it. I stare out the window and think about it. When I’m having breakfast I imagine what it’d be like cooking for a girlfriend. 

My problem is that one of my main symptoms of the depression I had was extremely low self esteem and self worth. I’ve been trying to improve that but it is so difficult. No matter how many times I tell it to myself, I just don’t think I’m *worth it*. I mean, I’m starting to come around. I think I’m pretty great. But there’s still that voice that says “no, better not bother her.” 

So I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to find the courage to start dating. Friends tell me that I seen like more of a “find them in the wild” type of guy instead of online dating, whatever that means. 

Just last night I was grocery shopping and I was in an aisle with a young woman, just me and her. We were both shopping for ice cream. Of course my brain is giving me the signal, “potential mate! Potential mate! Engage!” and of course I do nothing. She looked like she was in a kitchen uniform, had probably just gotten off work like me and didn’t want to be bothered. But aren’t those moments good times to approach someone? If that’s what my friends are saying....
I guess I could have asked what type of ice cream she was looking for or something, but to be honest with you my social anxiety has gotten so bad lately that every time I try to speak to someone out loud I just get a weird mental block and my words some out like mush. 

So I’m just posting this looking for advice/words of encouragement. I don’t really have anything to lose talking to a woman in public but I just can’t get up the courage to do it. I think I’d be a good boyfriend and the thought of getting to know someone else is so exciting. Plus I haven’t been intimate with someone in over ten years. Snuggling while watching a movie sounds like heaven. I was even (not seriously) thinking of going nearby to a rough street in my city and looking for a prostitute who would just cuddle with me for an hour. There are “professional cuddlers” in my city so I’ve been considering that. It’s a legit service. Not illegal and actually sounds like something I would like.
