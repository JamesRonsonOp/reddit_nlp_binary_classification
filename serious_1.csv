0,eufee5,One_Menu,1,How to deal with an impatient friend,"Hi,

I have a long-term friend who is impatient occasionally - maybe 20 to 25 % of our interactions. She says we are very close friends, but when this behaviour happens it's off-putting and in some kind of way a bit belittling.

I do try and dialogue and she'll just switch off. I kind of wonder about the future of this friendship.

What are your thoughts?

Thanks.",4,1580082906
1,esdguq,IamAtticus19,1,To teach here or there," Hello and good morning friends. I am in a bit of a pickle... maybe you can help me out? I used to teach kids and took a break for my mental health. I got new meds and my mental health is back to tip top shape. I want to go back to teaching but last year I got no interviews. Yesterday my old principal called me and offered me my old job back. Cons: Its an hour drive one way, I will be taking a large pay cut, I will be going back to work in a tough district with tough kids. Pros: I love teaching and I would be pretty comfortable going back to a job I know.",2,1579706573
2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

7,cyaqar,shartfarts,1,What do I do now?,"Let me start by saying the last 2 months have been the worst of my life. My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision. I just don't know what I want to do for a career. I currently am a Social Worker but that is such a challenge to me anymore. I would love to hear some suggestions or thoughts on the topic.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389

It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response.

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships. Also, my natural instinct is to tell literally remove him completely out of my life and all other guys.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend?

I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world.

I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

I had been married for about 2 to 3 years and he was in the process of being separated. I had no kids while he has two boys. Everything was fine... Until he went and caught feelings.


He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

51,3fuard,PinkGreyGirl,2,So my SO and I had a long talk tonight.,"Well, I say we had a talk. Really? It was me talking and him pretending to be asleep. I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""


Now I'm just trying to go to sleep and forget that this happened for a few hours.  I'm not looking for an upvote-I just want to be heard. A mod in r/casualconversations said that this would be better suited for this sub. So here I am. ",3,1438751864
52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks.

He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact.

But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world.

I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all. I really need some help here. Thank you. ",4,1496820000
39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not.

4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

28,8uzu01,Most_Art,1,Does anyone ever feel like their parents don't know as much as they thought they did?,"Okay,  so I'm just going to say it, I have prudish parents. No judgement.  People are different. I am socially rather conservative myself obviously  cause of my upbringing. But, now as an adult each time I speak to them  or spend time with them I find that they sound oblivious to the way the  world works. Like they told me not to leave my flat after 6 pm lmfao.  They still have issues with people who drink or have sex before/outside  marriage. They are just really sheltered to me, I used to think it was  because they grew up in a certain type of culture but I have met their  peers and family and no one is that sheltered.

So,  this leads me to my next point which is they might be lying or putting a  facade on in front of me. But, even while I lived with them they barely  had dinner parties, drank, smoked, went out much. Their lives were  mostly working and going to church.

Idk,  but this has got me feeling very overwhelmed like they might not really  be my go to for everything anymore. It's making me feel like they might  just not know anymore that I do and I feel like a bad person for  thinking like that.",0,1530337772

Back in mid-December of last year, me and two of my former friends had gotten drunk during a Scary Movie drinking game. One of the former friends and I had gone to the liquor store and had gotten vodka, two Four Lokos, and a Twisted Tea. After a while, we all started feeling drunk to the point of blackout. I had asked one of the former friends if I could kiss her, and she obliged. After that, she got on her knees and pulled down her pants and panties. My body had reacted faster than my mind could, and before I knew it, I had raped her. My nails, which were somewhat long, had cut her in her vag, and she looked at me and asked me what just happened. I looked down, then at her, feigning ignorance, and said ""Did we just...?""
After that, I hadn't seen or heard from her, up until yesterday. She had asked me to meet her somewhere, and when I did, I confessed that I had raped her. She nodded, knowing that I had to admit to it, and said that she was disappointed in me for this. She had trusted me, and I had done this unforgivable act in response. I'm saying all of this now because I feel remorse, knowing that she will never speak to me again. ",1,1516552455

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me.

And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication?

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision. I just don't know what I want to do for a career. I currently am a Social Worker but that is such a challenge to me anymore. I would love to hear some suggestions or thoughts on the topic.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response. In addition, it is heavily discouraged by our school board to take away marks for late assignments. Is my teacher's response towards my late assignment fair?",0,1543960806

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships. Also, my natural instinct is to tell literally remove him completely out of my life and all other guys.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend?

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights.

""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

Che is my hero because he is the ultimate symbol of resisting imperialism, and serving the revolution, whether through military action or civil.",0,1424860656
56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

So of course the guy would look somewhere else. And they seem to think that just because the girl is probably taking advantage of him and possibly cheating on the guy herself what they’re doing is reasonable. My friend and the guy don’t want anything serious and she doesn’t even want to be his girlfriend. Also according to the other friend (who agrees they’re not doing something reprehensible) the guy obviously wouldn’t want to break up with his hot girlfriend when my friend isn’t an option as a girlfriend.
Also my friend exchanged nudes with the guy and they think this guy who’s cheating on his girlfriend wouldn’t show them to others! That he’s not that kind of guy. 
I tried to tell them that she probably shouldn’t get involved with this kind of guy and that cheating isn’t right. But they just said that I don’t understand. Am I being too righteous and unsympathetic?

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response.

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact.

Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world.

From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something.

I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me.

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

34,7gfk33,jadaxie,2,How the hell do you know if someone is right for you?,"I've broke things off with this guy I've dated for around 3 months.

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit.

16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships. Also, my natural instinct is to tell literally remove him completely out of my life and all other guys. 
I really don’t know if any of this made sense, but if it did; any thoughts? ",2,1542672000

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

One of the former friends and I had gone to the liquor store and had gotten vodka, two Four Lokos, and a Twisted Tea. After a while, we all started feeling drunk to the point of blackout. I had asked one of the former friends if I could kiss her, and she obliged. After that, she got on her knees and pulled down her pants and panties. My body had reacted faster than my mind could, and before I knew it, I had raped her. My nails, which were somewhat long, had cut her in her vag, and she looked at me and asked me what just happened. I looked down, then at her, feigning ignorance, and said ""Did we just...?""
After that, I hadn't seen or heard from her, up until yesterday. She had asked me to meet her somewhere, and when I did, I confessed that I had raped her. She nodded, knowing that I had to admit to it, and said that she was disappointed in me for this. She had trusted me, and I had done this unforgivable act in response.

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication?

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are.

* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

I have a long-term friend who is impatient occasionally - maybe 20 to 25 % of our interactions. She says we are very close friends, but when this behaviour happens it's off-putting and in some kind of way a bit belittling.

I do try and dialogue and she'll just switch off. I kind of wonder about the future of this friendship.

What are your thoughts?

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families.

I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response.

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships. Also, my natural instinct is to tell literally remove him completely out of my life and all other guys.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend?

But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world.

I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement.

I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had.

But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all. I really need some help here. Thank you. ",4,1496820000
39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision. I just don't know what I want to do for a career. I currently am a Social Worker but that is such a challenge to me anymore. I would love to hear some suggestions or thoughts on the topic.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

People are different. I am socially rather conservative myself obviously  cause of my upbringing. But, now as an adult each time I speak to them  or spend time with them I find that they sound oblivious to the way the  world works. Like they told me not to leave my flat after 6 pm lmfao.  They still have issues with people who drink or have sex before/outside  marriage. They are just really sheltered to me, I used to think it was  because they grew up in a certain type of culture but I have met their  peers and family and no one is that sheltered.

So,  this leads me to my next point which is they might be lying or putting a  facade on in front of me. But, even while I lived with them they barely  had dinner parties, drank, smoked, went out much. Their lives were  mostly working and going to church.

Idk,  but this has got me feeling very overwhelmed like they might not really  be my go to for everything anymore. It's making me feel like they might  just not know anymore that I do and I feel like a bad person for  thinking like that.",0,1530337772

One of the former friends and I had gone to the liquor store and had gotten vodka, two Four Lokos, and a Twisted Tea. After a while, we all started feeling drunk to the point of blackout. I had asked one of the former friends if I could kiss her, and she obliged. After that, she got on her knees and pulled down her pants and panties. My body had reacted faster than my mind could, and before I knew it, I had raped her. My nails, which were somewhat long, had cut her in her vag, and she looked at me and asked me what just happened. I looked down, then at her, feigning ignorance, and said ""Did we just...?""
After that, I hadn't seen or heard from her, up until yesterday. She had asked me to meet her somewhere, and when I did, I confessed that I had raped her. She nodded, knowing that I had to admit to it, and said that she was disappointed in me for this. She had trusted me, and I had done this unforgivable act in response. I'm saying all of this now because I feel remorse, knowing that she will never speak to me again. ",1,1516552455

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron.

""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me.

I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication?

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change.

I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision. I just don't know what I want to do for a career. I currently am a Social Worker but that is such a challenge to me anymore. I would love to hear some suggestions or thoughts on the topic.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response. In addition, it is heavily discouraged by our school board to take away marks for late assignments. Is my teacher's response towards my late assignment fair?",0,1543960806

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships. Also, my natural instinct is to tell literally remove him completely out of my life and all other guys.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend?

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

So of course the guy would look somewhere else. And they seem to think that just because the girl is probably taking advantage of him and possibly cheating on the guy herself what they’re doing is reasonable. My friend and the guy don’t want anything serious and she doesn’t even want to be his girlfriend. Also according to the other friend (who agrees they’re not doing something reprehensible) the guy obviously wouldn’t want to break up with his hot girlfriend when my friend isn’t an option as a girlfriend.
Also my friend exchanged nudes with the guy and they think this guy who’s cheating on his girlfriend wouldn’t show them to others! That he’s not that kind of guy. 
I tried to tell them that she probably shouldn’t get involved with this kind of guy and that cheating isn’t right. But they just said that I don’t understand. Am I being too righteous and unsympathetic?

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks.

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact.

I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world.

From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something.

I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me.

I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

One of the former friends and I had gone to the liquor store and had gotten vodka, two Four Lokos, and a Twisted Tea. After a while, we all started feeling drunk to the point of blackout. I had asked one of the former friends if I could kiss her, and she obliged. After that, she got on her knees and pulled down her pants and panties. My body had reacted faster than my mind could, and before I knew it, I had raped her. My nails, which were somewhat long, had cut her in her vag, and she looked at me and asked me what just happened. I looked down, then at her, feigning ignorance, and said ""Did we just...?""
After that, I hadn't seen or heard from her, up until yesterday. She had asked me to meet her somewhere, and when I did, I confessed that I had raped her. She nodded, knowing that I had to admit to it, and said that she was disappointed in me for this. She had trusted me, and I had done this unforgivable act in response. I'm saying all of this now because I feel remorse, knowing that she will never speak to me again. ",1,1516552455

34,7gfk33,jadaxie,2,How the hell do you know if someone is right for you?,"I've broke things off with this guy I've dated for around 3 months.

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response. In addition, it is heavily discouraged by our school board to take away marks for late assignments. Is my teacher's response towards my late assignment fair?",0,1543960806
21,9ymjdf,whattheflipisup,1,I have no idea what’s wrong w me,"I have no idea if this is the right subreddit but I would love feedback if anyone has any time to spare. 
I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships. Also, my natural instinct is to tell literally remove him completely out of my life and all other guys.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

I looked down, then at her, feigning ignorance, and said ""Did we just...?""
After that, I hadn't seen or heard from her, up until yesterday. She had asked me to meet her somewhere, and when I did, I confessed that I had raped her. She nodded, knowing that I had to admit to it, and said that she was disappointed in me for this. She had trusted me, and I had done this unforgivable act in response.

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication?

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

I have a long-term friend who is impatient occasionally - maybe 20 to 25 % of our interactions. She says we are very close friends, but when this behaviour happens it's off-putting and in some kind of way a bit belittling.

I do try and dialogue and she'll just switch off. I kind of wonder about the future of this friendship.

What are your thoughts?

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response.

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move.

But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world.

I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement.

I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me.

We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had.

But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision. I just don't know what I want to do for a career. I currently am a Social Worker but that is such a challenge to me anymore. I would love to hear some suggestions or thoughts on the topic. Maybe something will spark an interest for me and I can start exploring. Thank you.",2,1567348845

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships.

Is it that you guys are in a mad flash to get through the rooms and it’s easier to just do the same thing each time or does corporate not really care and just hang the “conserve water” cards to check a box...do people who hang their towels just end up calling for fresh towels?

Anyways, seriously just wondering why it never seems to matter.

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all. I really need some help here. Thank you. ",4,1496820000
39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297

This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

People are different. I am socially rather conservative myself obviously  cause of my upbringing. But, now as an adult each time I speak to them  or spend time with them I find that they sound oblivious to the way the  world works. Like they told me not to leave my flat after 6 pm lmfao.  They still have issues with people who drink or have sex before/outside  marriage. They are just really sheltered to me, I used to think it was  because they grew up in a certain type of culture but I have met their  peers and family and no one is that sheltered.

So,  this leads me to my next point which is they might be lying or putting a  facade on in front of me. But, even while I lived with them they barely  had dinner parties, drank, smoked, went out much. Their lives were  mostly working and going to church.

Idk,  but this has got me feeling very overwhelmed like they might not really  be my go to for everything anymore. It's making me feel like they might  just not know anymore that I do and I feel like a bad person for  thinking like that.",0,1530337772

Back in mid-December of last year, me and two of my former friends had gotten drunk during a Scary Movie drinking game. One of the former friends and I had gone to the liquor store and had gotten vodka, two Four Lokos, and a Twisted Tea. After a while, we all started feeling drunk to the point of blackout. I had asked one of the former friends if I could kiss her, and she obliged. After that, she got on her knees and pulled down her pants and panties. My body had reacted faster than my mind could, and before I knew it, I had raped her. My nails, which were somewhat long, had cut her in her vag, and she looked at me and asked me what just happened. I looked down, then at her, feigning ignorance, and said ""Did we just...?""
After that, I hadn't seen or heard from her, up until yesterday. She had asked me to meet her somewhere, and when I did, I confessed that I had raped her. She nodded, knowing that I had to admit to it, and said that she was disappointed in me for this. She had trusted me, and I had done this unforgivable act in response. I'm saying all of this now because I feel remorse, knowing that she will never speak to me again. ",1,1516552455

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me.

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication?

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife and I were expecting our 1st son in late July/early August and in mid June we found out we had lost him....the worst day of our lives. We have both struggled since losing him. My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response.

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships. Also, my natural instinct is to tell literally remove him completely out of my life and all other guys.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend?

I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide.

39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

51,3fuard,PinkGreyGirl,2,So my SO and I had a long talk tonight.,"Well, I say we had a talk. Really? It was me talking and him pretending to be asleep. I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""


Now I'm just trying to go to sleep and forget that this happened for a few hours.  I'm not looking for an upvote-I just want to be heard. A mod in r/casualconversations said that this would be better suited for this sub. So here I am. ",3,1438751864
52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

Che is my hero because he is the ultimate symbol of resisting imperialism, and serving the revolution, whether through military action or civil.",0,1424860656
56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

My friend and the guy don’t want anything serious and she doesn’t even want to be his girlfriend. Also according to the other friend (who agrees they’re not doing something reprehensible) the guy obviously wouldn’t want to break up with his hot girlfriend when my friend isn’t an option as a girlfriend.
Also my friend exchanged nudes with the guy and they think this guy who’s cheating on his girlfriend wouldn’t show them to others! That he’s not that kind of guy. 
I tried to tell them that she probably shouldn’t get involved with this kind of guy and that cheating isn’t right. But they just said that I don’t understand. Am I being too righteous and unsympathetic?

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

Our teacher took away 10% of our mark because we did not finished a presentation on a date that was not specified. Basically, the presentation dates were chosen by a first come first serve basis. My group and I managed to get the second last date so there were supposed many presentations before us. When we asked our teacher when our presentation date was, they told us it was today! It was very unclear that other people had their dates moved back and people who were once last had to present first. No one had presented yet and we were extremely surprised. Although it is our fault for not knowing our presentation date, we were confused on why there were not presentations before us. Anyways, the people had their presentations moved back and were given an extension (which was like 5 groups). She never said that people had the opportunity to get an extension, only if they asked a day or more in advance. The worst part is that our teacher did NOT take 10% off the groups who asked for an extension. The teacher gave us an extra three days to do the assignment. The next day, we worked really hard to complete the assignment so that we could maybe gain some bonus marks. When we asked the teacher if we could present today and cut the deduction, the teacher said ""You should be happy I didn't give you a 0"". We were shocked by the response.

I used to date guys back to back, which started in about January of 2017. I literally wasn’t single from then to June 2018 with 5 different relationships. I figured out I was just being super insecure and using guys for my benefit so I swore off guys.It was that was until about a week ago, when I met a guy I randomly started liking, and couldn’t stop (which is weird because I’m very able to not like people at my own free will). He told me liked me as well, and now we have a thing going on or something. But, I’m having a huge amount of anxiety. Constant very bad anxiety has been normal with my last 2 relationships before this guy, but it’s pretty bad this time around when he doesn’t answer. I think I’m too controlling maybe, but I kind of like this guy and don’t want to continue to swear off relationships so I won’t get hurt or have anxiety, as I’ve been hurt in quite a few relationships.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact.

Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world.

From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello.

I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me.

I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all. I really need some help here. Thank you. ",4,1496820000
39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

He has recently started getting very....how shall I put it....emotional towards me. Which is OK, as in the past he has let me put some very emotional stuff on him. But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

I told him a lot-I asked him what I had done to make him stop touching me in any way, shape or form. I asked if there was anything I could do for him that would bring us back to where we were. And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.

2,enfvtb,QuantitativeTurmoil,1,I can't help but feel totally betrayed and am not sure of the best way to process it moving forward.,"This is going to be a bit lengthy, so there's the warning:

We'll call him ""Bob."" Bob and I met while in the military and while we didn't like one another in the beginning, we developed an intense and tightly-knit friendship over the next few years. We went through the shit together. We went through a whole lot of adversity as we deployed together, shared a lot of laughs, stories, times both good and bad. Unforgettable to say the least.

However, despite all of the times he's looked out for me and genuinely had my back (and I really do mean this. He's protective), he's also been very abusive towards me and I feel like I've had this weird sort of Stockholm Syndrome about it. Most of everyone else I knew of didn't seem to particularly like him or want to be his friend but I had it in my head that maybe if I could just withstand all of his tests that there would be real, genuine, long-lasting good and maybe even some change. 

Don't worry, I've accepted a long time ago that you don't just ""fix"" somebody but he and I also had a bond that was so strong that I knew he would have thrown himself in front of a car or taken a bullet for me. I was wounded by him now and again and I would always basically just accept it as a test of how good of a friend I could be. Also, given our history, I always knew it was unhealthy but I would justify it to myself on the grounds of me being stronger in the end and not being disloyal. 

I've since gotten out of the military and he and I haven't seen each other in a few years but we've always kept in regular contact. I met the woman who's now my fiancé almost two years ago and it's been wonderful. When I let my family and good friends of mine know that I intended to propose to her, they were excited and happy for me. They knew the both of us and never expressed anything but love and support. 

When I let Bob know about it, he was against it and has been since its inception. Not against the relationship, but against my wanting to marry her. The reasons he cited were that we've never lived together, never had sex and hadn't been together for as long as some people feel is appropriate beforehand. It's also important to note that I am a Christian and he isn't. There were always a few core life perspectives that I knew we'd never agree on but I accepted that. Let me also say that I consider it the duty of a good friend, whether right or wrong, to make your friend/family member aware of your perspective if you honestly believe that they're making a bad decision. Whether or not they agree with you is another matter but it is important to tell someone if you think they're headed off a cliff. 

However, I also believe that once you've done that, if they're still resolute in making their own decision, you should close your mouth and realize that you've said your piece. Since the inception of the proposal, he's always called me an idiot, a naive fool, whenever it's been brought up. It didn't stop despite me telling him that I respect what he had to say and that I wasn't just going to conform to those certain things because she and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us. Nevertheless, he was relentless and it was upsetting to her and especially to me. Another thing to add is that he never met her. He really didn't know anything about her other than her name. 

Whenever I would push back and explain myself, he'd brush me off as being naive and tell me that I wasn't listening to him whenever I had a disagreement about this. It got to the point where I told him that if his intentions regarding the wedding were to stand there with folded arms and say ""don't come crying to me when this burns down"" then not to bother and he told me ""I don't have to. You already know."" In the beginning, I wanted him to be my Best Man because of all we had been through together but then I found myself wondering if I should even invite him at all if this is how he's going to be. 

The invitations were sent out to everyone and things proceeded. She and I ended up deciding to postpone it unfortunately because we just decided we want to be a little more financially stable first and so we told everyone and their mother about it. A few days later, he reaches out to me and let me know in no uncertain terms that he was really pissed off at me because he had purchased an airline ticket only for it to be postponed and that it was where he stood although he told me he was happy I ""wisened up"" in time and that he couldn't complain too much there. 

I told him that I didn't blame him for being mad and that I would be too if I were in his position, but that I honestly didn't give a damn...at all... if anyone was angry with me right then while I had my own stuff to work out and that he knew me well enough to know I would never deliberately waste people's time like that. 

He then tells me that he used to know me and that ever since I met her I had become less and less like the person he once knew and that I could leave him be until I was ready to pull my head out of my ass. I respond asking him what I had done to mistreat him or alienate him because I honestly didn't know. I essentially pour my heart out about our history and all we had shared together and how a huge part of it was always putting up with this verbal bullshit and that after all this time I didn't know how else to handle it but to give it back to him. HE FUCKING WENT OFF on this tirade about how I didn't know him at all if I thought he was bitter for no reason at all. He told me he had no use for a friend who couldn't put aside his pride in a situation like this and that I treated him with disrespect whenever he tried to help me and that we were now exactly where he predicted it would end up and that the only one who was unsure was me. 

I was fucking flabbergasted. I didn't respond. I didn't talk to him for about 3.5 weeks until he got in touch with me again. He started off by saying something to the effect of ""now that you've had time to get your head straight I'm willing to have a discussion about all this""

Everybody reading this please don't misunderstand me. I do NOT say this to lift myself up but when I read that, I couldn't believe it. I was fucking laughing. Let me express to you all in no uncertain terms that it took every last ounce of restraint that I could muster not to absolutely explode. He told me I could start by explaining the reason I ""wisened up."" I did but I regret bothering to. Then comes him asking me something like ""let me guess, you still don't see anything wrong with how you acted?"" It was fucking nuts. I told him I didn't and then he effectively told me that any attempt at trying to reconcile with me was futile and that he had no further desire to speak to me because I either didn't understand or didn't give a shit about he explained it to me. 

I don't know what possessed me to do this, but I basically offered up apologies for my rationale in not picking him as my Best Man because I didn't want to enable shitty behavior especially if he wasn't supportive of the wedding and for whatever I did to hurt him. He told me that all was forgiven and that he just wanted an apology. I asked him to apologize to me and he told me he was sorry for how harshly he criticized my decision but that he still stuck by what he thought.

That was 3 months ago and we haven't talked since then. I say all that to finally get to this point. I would say he and I are good but we're not. I'm not anyway. Whenever I think about it, I feel this uncontrollable rage over it. I've only truly felt a ""how fucking dare you"" at the bottom of my gut only twice in my life and this is one of them. I'm indescribably angry at myself for how comfortable I allowed him to get and all of the bullshit I needlessly put up with not just now but in the past. I sort of wish I had just blown up on him when I had the opportunity to instead of acquiescing and asking him to give me an apology after I gave one which he was sort of shitty about anyway. I've gone home with the guy and met his family. They treated me like one of their own. We've been through so much together that only he and I share but why does it have to be like this? I have no intention of laying this out to him because of how he'd react. Sometimes I wish I were more brash and that I was less passive even when I tell myself I'm not. I don't know what else to say. I've had it. I've had ENOUGH with letting somebody that close to me treat me like that. That's it. I've been wanting to block him on social media but truthfully I have a really hard time bringing myself to do it because of any potential backlash I may face if he gets in touch with me. The whole time I've written this just now and every other time I think of it, I have an unbelievable sense of fury at this whole situation. I feel chewed up and spat out. I feel like a fucking failed science experiment.

To anyone who read all of that, thank you. What do I learn from this? What's the best way to move forward? How do I package this properly and help other people who might have similar experiences? Do any of you relate to my story at all? Please share with me if you're up for it.",0,1578788297
3,eglse7,One_Menu,1,I don't understand this relationship,"I know this is going to be appear to be a bit of an info dump. I'm trying to give some context. 

Decades ago I saw a therapist after I emigrated here and with a dysfunctional and often abusive mother and her partner. This therapist gave me a lot of emotional support which helped me get through college and sort out a lot of family of issues. There was no doubt that she was a mother figure to me. I was grateful to her. I expressed this to her a number of times over the years and felt really indebted to her. 

This therapist stayed in touch over the years, by phone, on my birthday or at Christmas. I moved West for work and whenever I returned east we would visit and have dinner.  In the early years after therapy, because I had no real family to speak of, I was at times needy. But always in the back of my mind I felt ashamed, that this relationship was a crutch and that I was pathetic for not ending it. To confuse things, this therapist always said that we were friends, that we had a friendship. For me though the relationship always had an imbalance.  I've actually suggested over the years that we don't need to be in contact and she's usually responded with something like ""There's no need to severe contact unless you want to"". And I've never been able to respond to that. Why? I don't know -  because it would be ungrateful, childish, unnecessary, hurtful?

Two years and two months ago I returned east for a new job; about 30 miles from this therapist. She texts me a lot and emails me, asks what I am up to, if I'm in touch with a sister, etc. In January this year she asked to meet for dinner, and then cancelled. When I reciprocated with an invitation in the fall, she said she was busy. 

Over the two years, I've received a lot of texts and emails, but it feels very confusing and painful. I now have someone who for some reason checks in on my life. Like she wants to know how the narrative goes. And my life is nothing unusually interesting. I'm just like everyone else trying to live life, pay the bills, figure out relationships, manage office politics. All the regular stuff. I've never enjoyed purely text or email relationships so I just don't get this. And it's incredibly confusing. It wouldn't be so confusing if it was a regular friendship, but it's not. Why can't I close a door on this?",0,1577505288
4,duwl42,paleponderer,1,To cut (or not to cut) this person out of my life,"Hi all - throwaway since this is a sensitive topic for me. Apologize for the lengthy nature of the story. 

Although complicated at it's core, I have been able to maintain a friendship with this guy I used to be intimate with (which I acknowledge is the root of my problems, but bear with me, I'm still learning) and while there are so many things about this person I am thankful for (sense of humor, shared interests that lead to great discussions, etc.), there was an incident that transpired during the summer that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

My friend/former lover (I cringe at that term, but whatever) doesn't live in the same country as me, so we were never in a committed, exclusive relationship. He is also recently divorced (no kids). He was in the process of moving to a different country when we started ""seeing"" each other (about 4 months before he moved away, never dated). In our phone conversations there was always a shared longing for each other though, which was articulated many times over the course of a full year (phone sex included), and when he came to visit, we would still hook up. Fast forward to this summer, and he finally told me that he was seeing someone. He really downplayed his interest in her, probably for the sake of my pride, but again, I would have been happy for him being happy since we weren't committed in any way. 

Did it suck to learn that? YES. Total bummer. But I really was happy he found someone and knew all along that long-distance wasn't going to work for us. In the very least, I was rational. We agreed to stay friends and that was that. But, do you ever have that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that you know something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it? I walked around for months with this heavy, unbalanced feeling. I kept having flashbacks to our conversations. The timelines didn't feel right. 

I found out (I finally, shamefully, stalked her Instagram) he had been seeing this girl for at least 6 months before he told me because he had traveled with her TO HER HOME COUNTRY for the Christmas holidays. He lied to me about his whereabouts that Christmas before, and the kicker -- even sent me photos of a ""trip"" he was ""on"" to an island, that must have happened on some other timeline that I won't even begin to investigate. Also, if you're traveling with a partner, you couldn't have JUST met them or started dating them, right? So the jury is still out on when they were ""official"". Honestly, I think they were already talking when we started seeing each other - she lives in the country he is in now. 

After carrying this feeling of suspicion around with me for months and having it validated via timestamp, I confronted him over the phone. He denied (kept saying they just started being ""serious"" when he told me about it) until I finally blurted out that I saw a photo online (he doesn't have social media). I felt so disrespected, angry for her (we had most certainly overlapped, if you get what I'm saying), and just plain DUMB. I willingly played the fool for way longer than I should have. 

For whatever reason, after this big blowup and his ""apology"", we still wanted to try and make a friendship work. I have a lot of empathy and sorta chalked up his mistreatment of this whole thing as an extension of someone going through a rough divorce and feeling lost, therefore not handling things very tactfully and not wanting to confirm anything that wasn't certain. He doesn't have many (any?) close friends, so I felt like abandoning him was self-righteous and cold. I also understand that he didn't owe me a relationship. At all. And it wouldn't work, regardless (age difference, want to have kids, he doesn't etc.) My mental health has taken a downward spiral as a result though. I feel weak, naive, and completely humiliated for being such a hidden part of someone's life. I really valued him as a person, but now that has completely been challenged and upended. I'm not perfect and fed into this whole situation entirely and still do, but I don't think anyone deserves to have to question their self-worth as much as I have the past few months. 

Every time I talk to him (which is probably once every 2 weeks give or take, not romantic, he typically initiates), I still have this undercurrent of anger and distrust. I also think that due to the lack of discussion we had regarding the situation - his explanation to WHY he neglected to fill me in on his relationship sooner was that ""he couldn't, but feels bad"" - is weighing on me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm waiting for him to take a strong ownership of doing something wrong, give me validation that I'm not over-reacting, have a strong sense of remorse for going behind his current girlfriend's back (who is still clueless to all of this) as well. I was hurt, and he certainly knew that, but we just sort of...moved on without excessive discussion of the topic. Last time we spoke though, we brought up Christmas plans (I asked if he was going to his girlfriend's home country again) and I inadvertently broke down, like full on shaking panic of embarrassment, lack of control, and frustration because it hit me how hurt I still felt. I went on the attack mode and said that I don't think I can trust what he says to me anymore, etc. It just sort of came out. He has such a strange hold over me that I cannot explain, so now I'm feeling bad for how I reacted. I even apologized for freaking out before we hung up the phone. I can't decide if I'm scared to face the truth that I'm just not as important to someone as they were to me, or if I am being incredibly childish in expecting an unsolicited apology. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, and I am asking you, the wise and impartial people of Reddit, to hit me with the truth: do I need to start a conversation with him in order to clear this up, take a deep-dive with the goal of understanding each other? or do I cut ties forever, write a nicely worded email or text, and move on? I've never ended a friendship before, so this makes me incredibly anxious. I also don't know how to have a deep conversation with him about this without coming across as self-righteous or like I'm obsessed with him or something - which believe me, I do not want him, I just really crave the decency of my feelings being validated here. 

Thank you all in advance for any hard truths. I've been in therapy for a few months now trying to talk this out, but I'm so weighed down by excuses both for him and for myself. I know this will be a great learning experience in the long term, whatever direction I take, I'm just very non-confrontational and awkward, so it's not easy.",1,1573497091

My wife has made a much better recovery than I. I started having panic attacks and had difficulty dealing with the depression. We both started seeing counselors and that helped. I was struggling to go to work, my job was in a hospital and was directly dealing with patients that were actively dying and difficult families. Also, my boss was a moron and did not know how to manage. I had a massive panic attack earlier this week and checked myself into a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal thoughts. Within hours of being there my mental wellness being improved and I was released after two days. Once I was released I decided I was going to quit my job and that scared me to death. I had never quit before having another position lined up. But I know most of my distress was caused by my current situation. So the day after I was released from the hospital I went to my boss and turned in my resignation. Explained why I was leaving and she understood. Left on good terms but now I don't know where to turn for work. I have to say my mind and body feel so much better after I decided to quit so I know it was the right decision.

9,clr6px,NathanThrowaway8470,1,"I Don't Know What To Title This, Just Gonna Vent A Bit","This post may be confusing to read. My apologies.

For the time being, this is my outlet where I can talk and vent out what has been happening. First, a bit of background:

I am a 22 year old male currently serving in the United States Navy, have been in for almost 4 years (left right after high school). Throughout most of my life there has always been great times where I feel on top of the world, yet there have also been the typical terrible times as any average person goes through, which doesn't make me special in any way. The generic description is parents with too many skeletons in their closet who often look away and make illogical points towards their lives and the lives of others (especially for me and my brother). I'm talking doing things that do more harm than good, hypocritical actions with the added touch of alcoholism to make them temporarily forget their problems for the night (until my mother keeps on going for days on end, especially after the death of my grandmother). Now that stuff I've been dealing with for decades (a little more than 2) now and not the direct cause of me feeling this way, but it is a defining factor in it all. Things getting interesting when me and the girl I've always thought of in high school (which we have been friends since middle school) finally got together. We laughed with each other, did everything together, generally made each of us happy. For 4 great years, not a single argument, not a single major dispute, everything was perfect between me and her. Fast forward a little bit and I leave for the Navy. Not giving away what I do, but obviously things get more stressful. The work picks up more as i'm constantly pushing myself beyond my limits at what I do (getting PQSs done, learning my rate more every day, guiding others) doing whatever I can to be the driving force of my division. We give it our all, others pile more on top of us, we do it again, more gets added, etc. A goal of mine is to pursue the NSW community, so for me every day was a day that I had to prove myself that I can do whatever it takes. After being stationed somewhere for about 3 years, I finally got my chance at pursuing that dream. Now have my orders to one of these communities, have my schools lined up (for those who know what kind of field this is they know what kind of schools i'm going to), the ""big dream"" of proving that quitting is never an option has finally arrived...

...except at the same time I have slowly been collapsing from it.

As time went on, myself (and others of course) have taken their toll from senior leaders and others alike who demand everything from us but will give little in return. Of my current CoC, I can think of about five leaders I can absolutely depend on 100%, which is very small to say the least. Over time I began to feel more and more depressed every day, thinking of how often we have been belittled and worn down. The constant days of working myself to death not just for myself but for the betterment of others has drained me heavily. To make things worse, the person I was with (who became my fiance a little less than a year ago) has also been undergoing problems. She was undergoing training for a new job when as time went on for her, with her job, supporting her family, others degrading her, she snapped herself. Quit her job, got away from her family and broke up with me because she just wanted to be alone. The worst part about that is after 4 great years with her, after doing everything I could to help support her and get her away from her toxic family (a whole other story), it was simply because I wasn't enough. She didn't cheat, she still loved me, she just looked at me after I said I could help her and said: ""I don't think you can"". Those years of thinking ""When I'm coming home again to see her"", ""When should we move in together"", ""When can we start our new life and help each other"", all gone because I couldn't be there enough for her. She eventually spoke with someone for help and was diagnosed with depression and ADHD, along with other ticks that she has been hiding. At this point, i'm okay with her doing whatever it is for her to get better, even if it means we never spend another day together at all. Her being happy means that i'm happy. Been a bit more than a month since we split up and I know I should be focusing on other things but I can't help but miss that feeling of have a genuine connection with someone to talk and check up with.

Now here I am: getting ready to transfer to a group of people who have no limits, while thinking that I'm about to reach my limit with no more fiance. Don't get me wrong I have also had fantastic moments in my time of service, with many more to come. From going underway to doing all sorts of things, it has been a blast that does make me hopeful for the future. What I'm afraid of however is how long am I willing to keep pushing myself to these extents? How far am I truly willing to go and how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice to get the opportunity to do great things with great people? There has been many days where I walk into work thinking ""I'm ready for anything"" yet there has been many other days where I go in thinking ""I should go to my LPO and say I'm done. Cancel my orders and get ADSEP'd (administratively separated)"". The crazy part is when I work everything seems somewhat calm in the moment, stressful yet reassuring. But the moment I stop and collect my thoughts, whether it's in my work area or sitting at home,  everything comes rushing back how I feel I don't do enough, people need me and I can't help, you'll never be enough, etc. I'm always excited and motivated when i'm working and improving myself in some ways yet I always have times where I stop and have my thoughts fester.

That just about covers it. I apologize for sounding vague at parts, but confidentiality is important to me. I'm really willing to keep going, find someone new and go do incredible things, but I have a lot more ground to cover if I want to reach that area first. Of course, finding someone now with how I feel isn't a priority to me. At the moment I only care about my job, my people, and what I can do to help.",0,1564885575

15,bb38hw,idontcarelove,1,I hate what this website has become.,"Reddit was so much better before it became mainstream (probably before the digg invasion) and all these rules, discussion micromanagement, and toxic cult subreddit, power tripping mods came about. Over the past decade this site has become progressively worse. 

I don't mean in some kind of hipster way. Things were just more casual and easy going back in the earlier days. Now you go to some subreddits and their rules are so vague to interpretation that mods can pick at will to delete, close, ban, remove any discussion just because they feel like it. 

It's become a place for discussion where discussions are actively suppressed for no reason. Subreddits should be a place of civil discourse where people are free to express opinions they disagree with without being silenced unless it violates the law like hate speech. 

Some subreddits need to hear opinions and see facts they don't like because it's good to see opinions contrary to the dogma that is the selective bias of subreddits. Some comments right or wrong would likely get 1000+ karma in one subreddit and -1000 in another subreddit. 

Is reddit still meant to be a discussion website or is it now just a thinly veiled collection of authoritarian cults? There are still some good subreddits but they seem to be getting fewer and fewer as time goes on.",0,1554781389
16,b573v1,Elainepaige123,1,This is my current situation and it's leaving me confused and depressed. What do I do?,"So here is my situation. I'm 20 years old and I'm in nursing school at the moment, but have a job as an ekg tech. Now, I live with my parents at the moment, but I pay my car note, phone bill, and I buy any other things I happen to want/need such as cosmetics, clothes, and some groceries. I sometimes want to pay rent to my parents and buy my own groceries and all, because that would make me feel more accomplished, but they both told me that would be ridiculous and that I should save the remainder of my money. It's just that not providing for myself at my age gives me a little anxiety and I feel embarrassed about it in a sense, I guess, but maybe they are right and I should save while I can. On top of this I really have no freedom here at home. I'm not allowed to date or go anywhere on my own and my parents keep a tracker app on my phone.

I know all of that sounds ridiculous, but I somewhat understand why my parents do these things, as before I paid for my car and all, I had betrayed them by secretly seeing a boy they didn't approve of. This all happened a couple of months ago. They didn't like the guy because he was an atheist and they are Christian. I am undecided at the moment as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out. I don't see him anymore tho, as he broke up with me over txt the day after I lost my virginity to him, but you live and learn I guess lol. He said that I'm too nice and emotional and that he is a bad guy and that he doesn't love me anymore.

soAnyways, I'm not allowed to see anyone else or go anywhere other than school and work because of this betrayal. Until I can be trusted again. They said I can't be trusted again until I am Christian. Should I move out to have some freedom and a life even though I can barely afford it or should I stay and save my money? The guy I was seeing was 21 and had just got a new job like a couple days before he dumped me.

We had plans to move in together as soon as he got his first paycheck, as we had worked everything out financially, but lying to my parents had turned me into a nervous wreck and I wasn't being myself. maybe that's why he left me idk. He didn't give me much of an explanation of where I went wrong and I'm so confused. He seemed sincere when he said he loved me and that he wanted to help and we were together for 5 months, so I don't think I got played. I just don't know what I did wrong. I can never speak to him again because I'm not allowed and he said he seemed like he still wanted to keep up with me. It's really hard to not hear from him at all.

He said that he didn't like the situation I was in with my parents and that he wanted to help me get out. I really loved him though. He was my first love. Now that he's gone without explanation I don't really have anyone. Sometimes the isolation makes me feel depressed, but I don't want to make rash decisions and I somewhat understand my parents stance, as I am ashamed of betraying them.

I also don't know who I am apart from them, as they glue themselves to aspect of my life and maybe being on my own would help me understand myself and make some friends or find someone new. I'm just in a super confused place I guess. Not sure how to move on from this guy. I keep thinking I'm over it, but then I end up randomly crying in public places, because weird stuff sets me off. It's been a month I probably should have moved on already, I imagine he has.

TL;DR my parents are super controlling, but it comes from a place of love. Regardless I'd like to have a life, but can barely afford it while in school. Should I take school at a slower pace for the sake of freedom? Also guy I was in love with and going to move in with dumped me after taking my virginity.

25,9bd3t0,sammyjamez,1,Why do we have a habit of exaggerating things?,"The world is a strange place - it is weird, crazy and ludicrous at times, but also at the same time, it is also quite scary, dark and complicated. 

And humans are just as weird and complicated and diverse with different cultures and mentalities and histories and these infinite blend of different factors cause complications and problems. 

Sometimes dire ones like war, famine, poverty and so on, sometimes problems that do not seem as dire but still need to be tackled like personal psychological problems, cognitive ambivalence, higher workloads and so on.

Although the world is a mostly pretty serious in general while also silly in its own way, I often felt like there is a pattern where most humans have a bit of a habit of exaggerating certain problems (well, at least that is one of the kind of content that I often see on the internet)

(and I am joking here - some problems were so exaggarated that they even led to wars like The Pig War, The War of Jenkins's Ear and even World War 1)

I know that the world can be quite serious and it is a good thing to be interested serious and thought-provoking issues because in the end, everything is quite deep and thought-provoking if you put a lot of effort and considerate thought into it. 

But is it worth it to really be worried about things that are not exactly in your control (at least not directly) or is it worth to really have to make such a big effort to emphasise the seriousness of a certain issue where you eventually end up making an ass of yourself when you do it?

I am mostly talking from every kind of problem that you can think of - from silly but still very passionate conversations like for example the cinematic universes of Marvel and DC and how much money they are making despite their repetitive formula, or talking about how much the game Fortnite is using every marketing tactic it can think of to get as much support as possible (and yes, there is a serious side to this when it involves promotion of gambling or gaming addictions); to even the most serious ones like talking about poverty, the gender gap or even the rants and complications of political correctness in Western society.

I can understand that some problems are not as serious for some people while simultaneously, other people think the opposite for the same kinds of problems but why do we have to be exposed to every issue, problem or phenomenon and perceive it like it is way more serious than it should be or treat it like it is just a tiny factor of a big bunch of other factors that will send the entire world into chaos?",0,1535575667

Back in mid-December of last year, me and two of my former friends had gotten drunk during a Scary Movie drinking game. One of the former friends and I had gone to the liquor store and had gotten vodka, two Four Lokos, and a Twisted Tea. After a while, we all started feeling drunk to the point of blackout. I had asked one of the former friends if I could kiss her, and she obliged. After that, she got on her knees and pulled down her pants and panties. My body had reacted faster than my mind could, and before I knew it, I had raped her. My nails, which were somewhat long, had cut her in her vag, and she looked at me and asked me what just happened. I looked down, then at her, feigning ignorance, and said ""Did we just...?""
After that, I hadn't seen or heard from her, up until yesterday. She had asked me to meet her somewhere, and when I did, I confessed that I had raped her. She nodded, knowing that I had to admit to it, and said that she was disappointed in me for this. She had trusted me, and I had done this unforgivable act in response. I'm saying all of this now because I feel remorse, knowing that she will never speak to me again. ",1,1516552455

We've known each other for more than a year, and got to know each other over a completely random reddit comment. It's a good story how we met. 

We started dating again in September, (before we tried to get together over long distance, with zero friendship foundation and about 12 hours spent together, so that fell apart quickly), and during this time, we were talking about future plans, I met his parent, he was planning to meet mine. But we never had the *relationship* talk.

We are both free-spirited people, big flirts, rebellious, a little childish, neither of us have had long term relationships. 

I decided to pop the question after a perfect movie date last Friday, and we fell apart within the span of 18 hours. He said he's not ready for a relationship, and apologised for the fact. 

Yeah, dick move. 

But the thing is, I've dated around, and not a lot of people even interest me. Be it body chemistry, personality, background, whatever, we fit really well. I would use the word explosive to describe our time spent together. (We've seen each other less than 10 times in total, we were crazy partying at the beginning, later he showed me his hometown, I met the dad, we communicated about marriage/kids/living on another continent... I don't know if this is moving fast?)

So my dilemma is, how would I know if someone is *right* for me? What should be the metric against which I judge a date/boyfriend? 

My friends are telling me that he's an asshole, and I can see that. I'd say he's more selfish and disagreeable than other guys I dated. What do you think?",0,1511981035

37,75eomn,Dark1Ce,1,My mindset,"For me, I've been thinking that my life is pointless and kept questioning about my life. I think life is pointless because everybody will eventually die at some point of our own life. Dying means that everything you had done before death was pointless. Some may argue that things that humanity had done is to ensure the survival of our species and prevent us from extinction. But we all know that the universe will be inhabitable no matter how hard we try. Everything that people have done in the past, present and future will be completely in vain. EVEN though humanity are able to stay eternally, it's just same cycle that just happens over and over again.

But having the news like nuclear bomb testing if North Korea really frightens me about the world situation. I'm afraid that World War 3 would happen. I'm 17 and there are many things in this world I have to experience. I'm still not able to chase the girl I dreamed of and I afraid that the war would come soon and bring destruction to me, her and the world. 

Why am I so concern about the world and her when I am thinking that life is a pointless process? This trapped in my mind for months already and I decided to share my idea. Hope that posting this would let me have some advice. Thank you for reading.

38,6frwpb,theguyperspn,3,I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot but I'm not doing too well right now,"I don't want to say I have anxiety, I probably think more anxious thoughts then the average person but I don't know for sure. I haven't been diagnosed, I haven't even talked to my parents about this because...well...I'm kinda scared to. I know this for sure though, I overthink just about everything. From saying hello to somebody (not even my crush, just anybody) to saying 'here' when the teacher calls me. It's very similar to 'Trees' by Twenty One Pilots, an entire song dedicated to the impossible task of what most deem to be simple, saying hello. We're not just talking mildly overthinking, I'm talking about on the verge of crying and my heart doubling in speed. Not to mention things like taking the bus to work or something. It has drastically affected my life. I can't get a different hairstyle yet in order to maintain my short hair I need a haircut occasionally and it's hard for me to get a haircut because I'm just so afraid of judgement. Again, I don't know what I have, whether it's just being a normal and I'm saying feelings that everybody secretly has or if I do have anxiety but it's life changing. Anyway, I met this girl 4 years ago and he was really nice and compassionate. I was her friend for 2 years and through those two years I learned she suffered from anxiety, or at least she thought she did, she said she had very similar symptoms that I've experienced and through that we bonded, able to support each other. After two years of us being friends we started going out. I did what I could to help her out as much as possible, making sure she knew she was the greatest human being alive and she did the same for me. I was there for her to cry on and express her feelings and I tried to fill her up with confidence. I graduated from high school yet she was a senior in high school still and we couldn't see each other as much. I saw her once a week every week. We were together for two years and one day she broke up with me. She was all I had. I had no more friends, I have never talked to my parents or bigger brother because I freak out too much and they don't care. Before you say they do trust me, they don't. Even if they did they give too much resistance to my weak attempts to get their attention. They're simply not an option. I literally have nobody to talk to and I'm still in love with her 3 weeks later. I've cried more times then I can count and I just can't do this much longer. I get way more anxious and she told me she wasn't sad about the whole thing which made me think I'm a horrible boyfriend. I simply can't feel happiness anymore. It's just this empty void of nothing but pain. Like a large open wound and a person pouring lemon juice mixed with salt. I desperately need help because I'm on the verge of suicide. The pain is horrendous and nobody is there. I have no phone, no friends, I have nobody and this is the lowest moment of my entire life. Everything I do gives me no happiness at all. I really need some help here. Thank you. ",4,1496820000
39,5upkt0,Mcheetah,1,I despise my body,"I was supposed to be 6'4"" by the time I reached adulthood. I was a 'somewhat tall' ten year old child growing up even though I never had my growth spurt. But then... I just stopped there. I literally haven't grown since age ten. I'm a fucking manlet, short pathetic nothingness. And it's ruined the trajectory of my life. I had so many dreams when I was younger. I wanted to do so much. But as everyone else grew up around me and I stayed the same, having never gotten my growth spurt or completed puberty, I began to despise the situation I was in. I despised it with a fire you couldn't possibly imagine. I hated what happened to me more than anyone could hate anything. I suddenly knew what it felt like to have your life and future taken away from you. Only, this was no drunk driver or thug with a gun ruining your life... This was your own body! I went from having the world open to me, to reaching 18 as literally the most pathetic thing I could ever imagine.

I spent years hating my life and failing at suicide. I was a prisoner trapped in my own body. I could suddenly relate to every 'woman' born in a male body. Only gender wasn't my issue, status was. I always wanted to change the world, grab peoples attention, make this shitty planet a better place to live. Maybe fix our real-life dystopia little by little. Suddenly, I could never do that. I was - AM - a joke. A hero trapped in the body of garbage, with no escape, no way out. I suddenly lost my identity. Everyone who now looked at me didn't see a glimmer of what I could be. They now saw the short, ugly, gross, disgusting human-toad of what I *am.* Only it's not really me. It's not what I'm supposed to be!

Here I am... Star of my own Disney fairy tale. Only, unlike Beauty in the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is no beautiful princess, no happy ending, no lesson to be learned. Just an ugly fucking freak in a body that is literally worthless to me. Only my intelligent brain has any value. The rest of this worthless sack of flesh and shit can rot away and die for all I care. This short, ugly, mediocre, half-baked sack of shit, useless, hideous, worthless, disgusting vessel of mine that I utterly loathe with all my being. Completely worthless socially and 99% worthless as a human body for physical labor. The social failngs suck more, though. I can't stand being seen as some ""40 year old"" obese ""fat-ass"" midget in the eyes of everyone else, especially by the females of the population. The male individuals simply underestimate you, but the females are simply grossed out by you. I act nothing like my body, though. So don't think I'm some gluttonous, loud, obnoxious, pasty, smelly, weed-smiking dumbshit living in his mother's basement in his 40's, though. Sure, I *look* like some mediocre piece of shit waste of oxygen, but I'm so much more than that obvious stereotype. Trust me.

It doesn't matter, though. My body failed me and if I wasn't attached to it, I'd kill it myself for ruining my life and turning me into this short, hideous, fat piece of shit. I can't correct my garbage height, I can't change my skin tone, I can't fix my face, and I can't lose weight. So, I've given up expecting love or a woman (who *don't* date short/inferior guys), as well as like minded peers, who I'd never fit in with.

As the piece of shit body I'm stuck in, i'm through expecting some things as a girlfriend or a sex partner. Ain't gonna happen. 

So I simply have the next 60 years or so to stop trying, because you'll never be taken seriously, you short day fuck. Especially since you're not the only one born with problems and others' are more obvious than yours which are just socially horrendous and simply unattractive.

So if you ever wonder why I act like such an asshole or always upset, now you know. Because I'm permanently stuck being me, and its the worst feeling in the world.",2,1487375607

But this time the emotions run deeper for him than they do for me. I've told him I don't want to leave my husband-I may not always be happy with him, but he is my husband. Well today my friend told me basically that the next time I tell him to stop saying something to me or doing something that he's doing that is implying anything other than a platonic friendship, that he is going to basically just drop me. How what I am doing wrong, in my defense? I've been nothing but honest and  told him from the start that I love my husband, and all of a sudden I'm the bad guy who is playing with his heart.

And then I started crying. I hate crying. It slows down whatever you're trying to say and makes you snot and sniffle like a moron. With everything I said, the one thing sticks out in my mind is this:


""I would take (ex-fiancé)'s abuse over your indifference any day. Because indifference is the worst thing of all that happens to a marriage-it isn't that one person stops loving someone else. It's that the person just stops caring. I would do anything for you, but you won't let me. I fell in love with you the night we met, but I was scared, because the last time I let someone in that fast, he ended up hitting and kicking me 3 months later. I didn't want to fall for you, but you did it. You made me love you. And now you couldn't care less. I would truly rather be slapped in the face, than just have you stop caring about me.""

52,2xfkvt,ConBrio93,3,I feel the way our society deals with extreme homophobia has extremely unfortunate implications for the gay community.,"I apologize as I couldn't find a title that could accurately surmise by observations. I'll instead explain what I mean in this post. Imagine you are reading an article about a Texas lawmaker who wants to bring back a ban on sodomy, and is virulently against gay marriage and such. A lot of the comments would undoubtedly be something like ""I bet he sucks dick on the down low"" ""he must be super closeted"" etc... The unfortunate implication here is that gays are ultimately responsible for their own suffering. This is because the people who are the most homophobic, and the most active campaigners against gay rights, are accused of being closet gays. I think what started out as a joke has essentially become a way to (inadvertently) shift blame away from straight people, and onto gay people, for the current push against civil rights. 

I'm probably being too sensitive, and I really doubt that the people making these sorts of comments (ie. ""he must be a closet case"") are actually trying to shift the blame to gays, but do those sorts of comments not actually hold this implication? I sometimes get frustrated by these sorts of comments because I see this implication in them. I don't know, and I'd like some other thoughts on this. ",2,1425097848

 - Born to a well off Argentinian family Che could have been a wealthy and successful Doctor. Unlike millions of citizens in South America, Che could have had a great, happy and long life, if he didn't care so much about the people suffering around him.

 - On the night of meeting a young lawyer in Mexico named Fidel Castro, Che was asked if he would take up arms, fight, kill and even die for a country he has never even seen. He agreed.

 - During the Cuban Revolution Che became an incredibley important asset to Castro, however Che constantly put himself in harms way, leading the soldiers into the most dangerous battles. After spending years asking him to not take so many dangerous missions Castro formally commanded Che to not put himself in so many dangerous situations.

 - What started out as a few dozen rebels boarding a yacht and sailing to Cuba with some firearms that were 30 years old ended in the deposition of Gen. Batista, the end of Cubans being a victim of imperialism and the end of the US mafia and corporations running Cuban industry. Now Cuba enjoys the highest life expectancy and the highest literacy rates in any country in South America.

 - Che didn't stop there, he tried to do what he did in Cuba in the Congo, Bolivia, other places like Rhodesia and some other countries were considered although from what I recall he never actually went to these countries, just talked to revolutionaries through the Cuban government.

 - In Bolivia he was surrounded by nationalists and taken prisoner. The next day 2 men came in with loaded rifles. Che said to them ""I know you have come to kill me. Shoot cowards, you'll only kill a man"" he was buried under an airport runway.

 - To this day soldiers all over the world read his work on how to effectively fight against an oppressive government. Some of these groups aren't all that nice, but some are. And ironically factory owners in Taiwan make millions of dollars every year getting 8 year olds to make shirts with Che's face on it.

56,2x39a7,brainandforce,3,Are statistics related to gender issues flawed?,"I keep hearing that women get paid 77 cents on the dollar for equal work, but this sets off my BS detectors immediately, for various reasons:

* This is 2015 in America. Genders are nearly (notice nearly) entirely equal. Society tends to treat men and women nearly (notice nearly, again) the same.
* Women tend to work fewer hours than men for various reasons (i.e. traditional gender roles put women at the center of family life).
* Women and men choose different jobs. Granted, a lot of jobs that women dominate in should have higher pay (biology has women outnumbering men at a nearly 2:1 ratio!) but there is a pay gap between jobs.
* If most corporations paid women less, why don't they just hire women and make higher profits?

I'm not denying there is a pay gap in any sense  - I've seen statistics showing a pay gap from 4 to 10 cents, which needs to be fixed.

Another statistic I find ringing my BS detector is the ""1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus."" If the problem was this big, I doubt college campuses could get by with so few police.

Also, doing the math for a ballpark estimate of sexual assaults on campus:

28000 students at my university - about half are women, for the sake of convenience let's go to 10000 women. 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted (20%)...so 2000 women, in this example...in the four years they spend on campus. 4 years is about 1461 days, not counting vacations. So on average, one or two cases of sexual assault should occur every day.

We get emails here when any sort of event occurs on campus (break-in, robbery, murder, etc.) I don't see sexual assault emails sent every day - more like once a month. Christina Hoff-Sommers puts the actual numbers around 1 out of 40, far better but still a problem that needs to be rectified.
