"Resources for a newbie home winemaker I want to find a comprehensive resource (book, website, forum...etc) to learn home winemaking in a principled way.

What to add. How much to add. When to add it. Why it is needed. When it can be skipped. Steps and directions. What to measure and record. What to look out for. Common problems, how to spot and troubleshoot them...etc.

I know there are bits and pieces of this information here and there in Reddit and perhaps other forums.

What I am looking for though is a well-put-together resource that would hopefully have all the basics covered in a well-organized way.

Maybe a book? I looked for one on Amazon, but there seem to only be a few and their reviews aren‚Äôt the best.",winemaking
"A question about kit wine I‚Äôve made quite a few batches that have all come out pretty good. About little more than a year ago I started a batch, put it in the carboy and was supposed to transfer it out and add stabilizers and put it back in the carboy. I didn‚Äôt do this and it‚Äôs been sitting there every since. It smells fine. Should I stabilize and bottle after another week or do I need to dump it and start over?",winemaking
"Riesling - My First Wine Hi Everyone,

I am going to make some riesling for the first time. This is also the first wine I am making. I would like some general tips and hacks, Google is proving very hard for me as there doesn't appear to be many good resources available unlike beer making! 

I am using a concentrate kit to make 23 Litres that claims to have everything in it that is required. I have also got at home fermaid A.

The guide says to ferment at 20 degrees C. I will probably opt not to do this and cold ferment at around 13 degrees C. I think it best to order in some specific yeast as the kit does not say what yeast I have - any advice? 

Any other tips? Ideal water profile for diluting the concentrate? I also have french oak spirals has anyone ever put them in? Here in Adelaide Riesling does come very, very lightly oaked occasionally",winemaking
"Persimmon Wine Straining? Hello! This is my first time making Persimmon wine/cider and my first attempt at doing a wild yeast ferment. 

We prepped them by cutting out any brown/black/moldy spots and cored them (approx. 22 lbs/10kilos) 

Added to a 5 gallon bucket with 8 liters of water and an amount of sugar (all of this was guesstimated from a recipe online) (I will be adding more sugar down the line in the next fermentation steps.)

We were worried the fruit wouldnt break down enough on its own so we scooped out ripe pieces and blended them up. Now we have an extremely thick and viscous liquid that I am unsure will filter out very easily.

What should we do? Will the solids fall out eventually? Should we just try to strain it and hope for the best? The consistency is somewhat like slightly watery grape jam.",winemaking
"Wire used for Trellis Hey all - I'm planting some Cayuga White vines in the spring so in anticipation I have slowly started to build my mid-wire cordon trellis. So far I have put the main support posts in the ground and I started ordering some of the hardware. Everything I read is asking for 12.5 G high tensile wire. Where does everyone find this at in such large quantities? I will have 4 rows each 80 ft long. 

Originally, I was planning for 3 rows of the wire. However, looking at some examples online I see that the top row seems to be a double wire is this completely necessary? Or is it possible to run one length of wire instead of doubling up?",winemaking

"Noobie Question about bottling This is probably a stupid question but I bought a winemaking kit and it came with a transparent starter hose and a glass push down bottler that is supposed to fill the wine bottles from the bottom up. I'm familiar with how the process should work, but I honestly have zero clue how the hose and the bottler and supposed to physically connect. No one on youtube explains it and the two outside diameters are slightly different (by maybe a millimeter or two. I triple checked and can find no connectors in the kit. I debated duct taking them together but decided not to. 

I've heard lots of people mention clamps of some sort, but I don't know what sort specifically and I don't think a screw down hose clamp from Lowe's would be very useful. I assume this is very simple and I'm just being clueless, but could someone please explain how this is supposed to work?",winemaking

"Instant Pot...Wine? Hey, a poster in another sub recently asked about making wine in an Instant Pot. I replied that I couldn't really imagine a good reason to do so, but I'm far from an expert vintner (I've probably got less than 6 batches under my belt, though I've been brewing beer for 20 years). So out of curiosity, is there any GOOD reason you would do [this](https://www.today.com/recipes/instant-pot-wine-recipe-t124206)? I get kick starting the initial ferment by holding things at a higher potentially higher temp but it seems like it would be a pretty negligible difference in the overall ferment time. If I'm just trying to make hooch in a plastic Welch's bottle, is there any  tangible benefit to the above vs just pitching everything, aerating and letting it sit?",winemaking

"Is there a way to evaporate water from an ongoing plum Oloroso sherry? Long story short, me and my father discovered a long forgotten half-filled jug of now aged and oxidized plum wine. I decided to do something creative out of it. I'm currently continuing the oxidation process to give it the more clear caramel hints that you often find in Oloroso sherry, and I've also cleared out the hydrogen sulphur odour, so it's going great so far!

However I'm curious if there is a way to allow to the water to evaporate a bit to concentrate the flavors and the alcohol to make it go from 14% -&gt; 18%, like they do in certain types of fortified wines. I know the acid will become concentrated too, and I plan to deal with it later on. I don't have any oak barrels on hand though, and AFAIK they do play a role on allowing the evaporation of water. Are there any methods that a simple homewinemaker can partake in?",winemaking

7 years ago, I bought a carmenere bucket and fermented it.  As it was sitting, it started fermenting again after 3 months.  I called the bucket company and they told me to add sorbate.

"Red wine looks murky / cloudy Hey,

Ive been in the process of making my own red wine without any added sulphites. I have kept everything super sterile during the process, and have minimised oxygen as much as I can.

The wine is still quite young, just over 3 weeks old from when it was placed in a carboy, and has been racked twice. 

I notice the lees always build up eventually at the bottom. You cant really see the cloudy nature of the wine unless you shine a torch to it up close. There is about a 1cm line of what looks like clear red wine and the rest below it is murky / cloudy. Its been like that since day 1.

Tasted it today for the first time...it's the best raspberry wine I have ever made, and I've been making wine since I was 14, a looong time ago!

"Pineapple wine won't clear Hi guys,  
So this summer I decided to make some pineapple wine. I've racked it twice and it's now currently in my basement with no heating in an attempt to cold crash it.  
However it is still pretty cloudy and I was wondering if this is just an inherent property of pineapple wine, as in they won't really clear up as much as other wines will.  
At the same time I made a banana wine which is currently completely see through!  


If any of you know or have any good ideas as to what I can do to clear it if possible, i'd really appreciate it!

"Any luck removing off-flavors (mold?) by filtering? I aged some Nebbiolo I made in 2019 in oak barrels that I‚Äôve used 2 time prior (they are close to neutral now). During the 6 months or so that they didn‚Äôt have wine in them before this batch, they were filled with sulfited-water and topped every month or so... however.... when I popped a bottle to give the batch an early taste, it was clear that it had been infected with something - a moldy taste. Not overwhelming, but right at the edge of what I‚Äôd call drinkable and definitely not what I was shooting for. I just gave the barrels a good whiff and they have the same smell - so this is the probable source.

As anyone ever had luck salvaging something like this? I was thinking about pulling the whole batch back into a carboy, adding K-Meta, then filtering with fine pads, then rebottling. The filter media is spec‚Äôd at 0.5 microns and I believe mold spores are quite a bit larger than that.",winemaking
"Will adding in bits of dried fruit or flowers into my bottles ruin wine over time? My magnolia forget-me-not chamomile mead finally reached just under the alchohol level I was aiming for, so I tossed in some calcium bentonite clay and placed the container into my fridge to slow fermentation, now I have to wait about 2 days. Once it is all settled, I'm going to filter the clearified mead then pasteurize it, to kill off the yeast. I was thinking of tossing in a flower or two, or maybe some sundried strawberries (prior to pasteurization); once bottled will these solids spoil or ruin the wine? Is this a safe idea?

"When to carboy? What am I factoring in here? Hi y'all! First time posting here! Am usually stuck in r/fermenting.

I'm curious what things people consider when moving their wine from a bucket to a carboy.

For context I have a cranberry wine that I started about two months ago now. original gravity was 1.098... currently at  1.053.

Its naturally fermenting so nothing added apart from sugar at the beginning to get the og where I wanted it.

It's definitely still fermenting. I get a little burble from the air lock every twenty minutes or so. 

It has about an inch of head room in the bucket ( strained the solids out a while ago)

I'm basically waiting for the gravity to go down a fair bit more before moving it. But everytime I check up on it I'm just like why wouldn't I just do this now?

"Can you use argon wine preserving gas to decrease oxidation speed in a carboy? We just racked over some plum wine to a few pet carboys for clearing. However there wasn't enough to completely fill up to the neck on one of the carboys, so it's currently sitting filled up to right below where the carboy starts to narrow down, so it will probably eventually oxidize if we let it sit like that for too long. We could add some glass marbles into the carboy, but we feel it will be a too messy job during clearing, and want to wait with that until the wine has been cleared and racked and is ready for the bulk aging process. So we need a temporary solution during a few weeks. 

I was thinking since the wine has been sitting in the fermentation bucket for a few weeks now without oxidizing thanks to the protective CO2 layer, wouldn't it be possible to make a similar short term solution by adding argon gas to the carboy from a wine preserving gas can - assuming we add it properly? Argon gas is heavier than regular air similar to CO2, and is odourless, so it should form a protective layer as well. Not saying this is a permanent solution, only during the few weeks of clearing.

* 1 t acid blend
* 1/2 t tannin
* Sugar to 1.09 SG
* SN9 yeast
* 1 t yeast nutrients

"We have received 8 bottles of Moldavian home made Wine. So my girlfriend‚Äôs family has sent us 8 bottles of various home made wines from friends and relatives in Moldova in plastic bottles. 

Moldova produces some fantastic wines, and as I understand it, they were one of the top producers of wine in the Soviet Union before its collapse. Everyone in the countryside there makes wine. 

This home made wine, however, is not quite Cricova. I have no idea how it was made except that it was made this year.

What can I do to help improve the wine? So far I have used coffee filters to filter it into glass bottles. Will storing them somewhere cold and dark for a while help them?",winemaking
"Primary Ferment Gravity Showing 0.998 in 5 days?! Hi all!  


I'm new to winemaking, and this is my first ever batch. 

So, I ended up buying around 18kg of seedless black grapes from my local supermarket (they were really good quality, grown in Peru &amp; Brazil) and have a really deep colour to the juice.

I crushed the grapes and placed them into a fermentation bucket with an airlock. I have only punched the cap down once a day, when I know some people have done it at least twice to four times a day. This might have been a mistake, I'm not sure yet. 

The initial gravity of the juice before pitching the yeast was 1.090. Today is the evening of day 5, and I decided to test the gravity as the bubbling of the airlock slowed down drastically. It read at 0.998. I heard this is when fermentation is completely done, but I also heard it should be around 1.030 at this stage. I did find a blog article saying that fermentation *can* be done in as little as 5 days, although rare. 

My questions are:  


1. Is it bad that fermentation is done at this point?  
 
2. I would still like to clarify the wine by letting it sit in a carboy and racking once or twice - can I do that?  

3. I tasted the wine and it tastes more on the acidic side, with not much body - will those acidic flavours mellow out with age? The alcohol is definitely there!

Thanks folks!",winemaking
"A question about punch down and sanitizing equipment Hello everyone, I'm new to winemaking and I'm currently starting homebrewing some fruit wines and i have a couple of questions regarding primary fermentation and punching down the fruit cap. 

So, I'm currently doing a batch of persimmon wine in a 25 lt fermentation vessel, and i've added the yeast a couple of days ago. Problem is that after one day the solids of the must rose above the liquid and i was wondering what to do with that. So I started looking online and i found out about punching down, which i didn't know a thing about( as i said this is my first project regarding fruit wines).

My question is: is it safe to punch down the fruit cap with a steel less ladle or something like that? should i sanitize it every time before punching down the cap? I'm worried about spoilage and i've got to say that there's another thing that isn't clear to me: reading about wine making/cider making it seemed to me that you want to reduce the contact with oxygen as much as yo can during fermentation, but to what extent? I' m beginning to understand that is much more crucial during secondary fermentation while during primary it isn't that much of a cause of concern(maybe also because yeast do need oxygen during alcoholic fermentation? i don't really know so any kind of explanation is very much appreciated). So is it ok to open the the vessel a couple of times a day to punch down the fruit cap? should i also mix everything when i do this?

Last question regarding sanitizing the equipment: with the fermentation vessel i also got some e224 potassium metabisulphite to sanitize the vessel and the equipment, as said in the instructions pamphlet. is it ok for sanitizing everything? I usually wash the equipment in a water solution with e224, then rinse again the equipment with water.

Also can i keep the solution in a container for a few days and re-use it? or is it better to throw it away  and making it again every time?

"Spontaneous Fermentation - To Add Sulfites or No? So I made my first wine with wild grapes using spontaneous fermentation (I did add sugar and diluted with water to raise the pH). So far it seems to be going according to plan. Fermentation was great. Definitely tastes like a red wine that just needs to age--but a little tart. 

I pressed it about a month and a half ago, then racked it off sediment about two weeks ago. I plan to bottle this weekend. 

My question is, do I even need to add sulfites? I haven't so far. I have been VERY careful about oxidation, especially after fermentation has completed. I've filled my jugs up to the top and what not. So, from say a home-brewing perspective (which is what I'm way more familiar with), I wouldn't be worried about oxidation. 

But, with bottling, I do slightly worry because I know these bottles will be aging... for a while. 

So, should I add campden tablets? Part of me doesn't want to. I like the thought of the old-timey times when they wouldn't have been able to do that sort of thing. I know it's a buzzword--but I did want to make this wine as natural as possible. 

But, if I do decide I want to add sulfites, how many campden tablets should I add? I've got about two gallons--a 1 gallon jug filled to the top, a 64 oz growler filled to the top, and a 32 oz howler filled to the top... I figure the headspace I filled amounts to the remainder of the second gallon. 

And, how long should I wait after adding, if I do decide to add, can I bottle?

Also--any tips on reducing the tartness/acidity would be appreciated.",winemaking

"Does the lees help to protect the wine? Whenever I make wine, after the first racking I put a little sample of what's left into a little ""potion"" bottle. This includes the lees. The purpose for this is so that I can monitor the aging of the wine without having to actually touch the real wine, I can just look at the sample.

As such I periodically open the sample bottle to smell the wine, many times whenever I am bored. This means the sample gets exposed to oxygen fairly often. However, the sample never seems to go bad.

Meanwhile, in one of my demijohns I left a bit of headspace and over time the wine in the demijohn developed some [flowers of wine](https://www.bacchus-barleycorn.com/catalog/article_info.php?articles_id=25), The same sample never developed anything.

The only thing that I can think of that is really different between the racked demijohn and the sample bottle is the lees. Does anyone know if the lees has some sort of protective properties?

"Carbonic Maceration at Home - An Experiment I'll preface this with I'm a brewer and this was more an experiment to see what I could do with wine grapes. I have an Aglianico vine that came from a very old (100 year old, at minimum) vine at a family member's house before the passed. We've had this vine for almost 20 years now. It yields about 3-4lbs of grapes, total. We do no maintenance except trimming in the winter. 

This summer, I discovered five massive vines of vitis labrusca growing across from my house in wetlands. 

So late September I harvested my Aglianico and a whole bunch of the fox grapes, basically whatever I could get my hands on that were ripe and in low brush. 

I ended up with maybe 8lbs of grapes, total. Like anyone who just wants to experiment, I decided to try carbonic maceration. I dumped all the grapes into a keg, hit it with enough CO2 to seal, and left it.

And by left it, I mean I left it there for two months. Yesterday I decided I needed the keg and emptied it. When I opened it yesterday, the grapes were sizzling. 

Took the macerated grapes and pressed them to get whatever liquid I could. Ended up with 800mL of young wine, clocking in at 1.010. So I threw all the liquid in a 2000mL Erlenmeyer and let it chill overnight. Today I racked off the sediment into a lone 750mL bottle.

"Juicer for winemaking? Hey all

I'm doing a little research on what I can use to make homemade juices. I'm between a large press, or a juicer, which will allow me to experiment quite a bit. But it seems a juicer will either only make white wines (juicers that exclude grape skins and stems) or reds (juicers that blend anything put into it). 

Are there any juicers (or alternative options) that will work for you?

"Why does wine turn into vinegar? (Answer) [copied from r/BrewingNewbies]

Most people know that vinegar is made from wine, but what makes wine into vinegar in the first place? Well, there are two answers, a long one, and a short one. The short answer is adding additional oxygen after the first week. The long answer is because of a bacteria called Acetobacter. It produces something called acetic acid, it basically makes vinegar, vinegar. Acetobacter uses alcohol and oxygen to produce acetic acid. That's why it's important to not put in any oxygen after the first week, maybe even sooner.
Now how can you prevent that? Well, you can use chemicals like Campden Tablets, Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite. But if you're like me and don't want to use added chemicals then there are a few steps you can take to make sure Acetobacter doesn't have the time or resources to turn your wine into vinegar. First fermenting, as I said above you should never add in more oxygen after the first week, you can keep it out by using an airlock, or by using a siphoning tube when racking or bottling. Second, you can sanitize everything before use. Yes, Acetobacter is on anything and everything but sanitizing will make it so there isn't as much of it when you're brewing. Lastly, you can pasteurize OR cold crash your brew when it's done fermenting (note: this only works if the Acetobacter hasn't already turned your wine into vinegar) this will help kill anything left alive if you're planning on leaving it in long turn storage.
I hope this helped clear up some confusion because I know some people want to hear details and explanations and not just ""don't put in oxygen"".",winemaking
"""Micro-oxygenation"" at home with a silicone bung? Hey all,

I know micro-oxygenation is usually done with a special very-low-rate diffuser on a commercial scale, which is practically out of reach for the home winemaker

Could you mimic the process using a silicone bung?

According to this [study of bungs](http://www.better-bottle.com/pdf/ClosuresOxygenPassageStudy.pdf), the oxygen transfer rate of a silicone bung averaged at 19.6 cc / day. A little googling showed me that is approximately equal to 1.5 mg / L of oxygen per day for a 5 gallon enclosure (please feel free to check my working here) - in other words \~45 mg / L / month.

In ""Concepts in Wine Technology"", Yair Margalit suggests an oxygen dosage rate of between 20-60 mg / L / month for MO.

Does that mean I can effectively add a MO protocol to my home setup using a silicone bung and a 5 gallon enclosure? Or does the diffuser do something a bung cannot?",winemaking

My method is I first add all the fruits, flavors, water, sugars, yeast, and whatever else I'm adding to the wine into a jug. Then I let that ferment and mix together until I get the flavors I want (this might take a week or 2). Then I rack that into a new jug trying to just get the flavored water and the yeast (basically just filtering out the fruit pulp), with some additional sugar and maybe a little bit of extra yeast if needed. I then let that sit and continue fermenting until the max amount of ABV is reached and the yeast are dead. After all of that is done (maybe a month or so) That's when I rack it again into another jug, just to let it sit and clear up naturally since I don't typically like using added chemicals to my wines, Then I bottle it all up.

"Strange pH shift during MLF Hi guys, 

2 Questions:

1. Is my pH shift normal?
2. When would be best to deacidify?

Now the details:

I am nearing the end of the MLF (225l barrel) of my Merlot from grapes, and I came across a rather strange phenomenon that no books or materials I read have an explanation - the pH decreases from the initial starting point, yet the TA decreases too, and there is no off smells at all. 

Let me give you the numbers: 

Must at crush : 3.38 pH; TA - 7.9g/L
Day of MLF innoculation (post fermentation) - 3.30 pH; TA - 8.2 g/L
1 month into MLF: 3.31 pH 
Today (1.5 months after MLF start): 3.25 pH; TA - 7.7 g/L

I keep the barrel at a constant 22 degrees Celsius at a temp controlled underground cellar. The barrel has an airlock and I often top it up, but I try to introduce oxygen as little as possible. 

My understanding is that during MLF the pH is supposed to increase and the TA to decrease, yet my numbers are wild. Full disclosure - I use Vinmetrica SC300 for measurements and I make sure I make regular calibrations, and all my chemicals are new (this vintage). 

Also, as I am nearing the end of the MLF (I used Vinmetrica SC-55 to measure my malic acid), and it is pretty much there at 0.21kPA reading, would you guys recommend me deacidifying now with potassium bicarbonate, or age it this way and wait until bottling to do so?",winemaking

"Question about the alcohol content So this is my second year making wine from my natural growing concord vine in my back yard. Last year, the method was to let the must sit with the loose lid and agitating multiple times a day. This continued for the primary aerobic reaction. After about a week and most of the natural sugars had been consumed (but not sitting too long), I chaptized the batch to get the exact alcohol % I wanted (roughly 15%) and put the juice mixture into carboys for the anaerobic reaction. 3 months later, I had some delicious high proof concord wine with a final hydrometer reading exactly at 1.000. 

This worked great, and I still have some from that initial batch today. However, I'm now reading some websites (such as this one)[https://eckraus.com/wine-making-101/] saying that alcohol is produced during the aerobic stage? This doesn't make sense to me because everything I have read says that yeast when under aerobic conditions only multiplies but doesn't break down the proteins to actually make the alcohol, or at least very little by comparison to the secondary anaerobic stage. 

Can someone give me some clarity in this? I find it hard to believe considering the following.   

1) The sugar content of the grapes before hand would have put the wine at nearly 12% already without chaptizing it.   
2) There was no sugar left in the must after about a week of primary fermentation. So if there was alcohol, it would have been in the must.  
3) I put enough sugar to make the batch 15% alcohol for a finished product.  
4) The final reading was 1.000 meaning all sugar was consumed during the secondary fermentation.  
5) If there was alcohol produced in the first stage, the total alcohol would be WELL over 20% which the yeast is only rated to 15%.",winemaking

"Red Wine Fizzy So I‚Äôm currently in the process of fermenting my first ever batch of pinot noir. I bought a grape concentrate and a kit from a wine store. I sanitized all my equipment. Followed the steps. As of now, my wine has been fermenting for 4 days, at approx. 24 degrees celsius. The instructions said to use the primary fermenting container, which in my case is a simple bucket, and loosely cover it with the lid. The lid is not clipped onto the bucket, but it‚Äôs not ajar either; it‚Äôs just loose, yet covering the entire bucket. I‚Äôve checked my wine everyday for the past four days, and was pleased to see a thick foam floating over my fermenting wine. But today I was a little worried when I discovered that the foam had disappeared, and that the liquid was rapidly fizzing, such as a bottle of club soda when just opened. It‚Äôs really fizzing quite rapidly. Tiny bubbles surfacing energetically and plentifully. Is this serious? Have I failed at some point or another in the process? Is my wine even still fermenting? Should I throw it out and start afresh? And, if my wine is, in fact, perfectly fine, will it yield a fizzy product? Or, if it has failed in some respect, can I save it?",winemaking

So far so good, but now just a few hours later, that soda bottle is already feeling pretty tight. But every guide I've read tells me that it will take around 5 days to a week.

Ian Tattersall and Rob DeSalle Interview, Natural History of Wine 

American Museum of Natural History 

10 Scientific Discoveries of Wine and How They matter in Your Glass. 

A huge Punchdown shoutout to Ian Tattersall and Rob DeSalle, two men I‚Äôve spent dozens of hours with, but have never met.  I‚Äôm on my fourth read of their amazing book‚Äîwhich is far more narrative page turner than the title might imply.  The Natural History of Wine and Patrick McGovern‚Äôs ‚ÄòAncient Wine‚Äô influence my wine education beyond any two other works I‚Äôve consumed. 

Mr. Tattersall:  Give us a short introduction to your journey into science and what brought you to wine and the study of its natural history? 

Mr. DeSalle:  Tell us a bit about yourself, the American Museum of Natural History and why every American should visit your museum at least once in their lives. 

The focus of this interview is to connect the scientific understanding of wine to the daily enjoyment of it, which is also the focus of the first two chapters of your Book:  Vinous Roots and Why We Drink Wine. 

Ian:  Can you tell us a bit about the site, village and grape called ‚ÄòAreni‚Äô in Armenia?  There are older wine-production sites that have been confirmed, but are we just scratching the surface with Areni?

Rob:  An older site, Hajji Firuz Tepe, located in the West Azarbaijan province in north-western Iranand flanking the Zagros Mountains, believed to be the area where grapes were first domesticated (Patrick McGovern calls this the Noah Hypothesis) represents a mud-brick settlement from the late Neolithic, and is a village that would have been among the first settlements to use fired pottery. What is the significance of pottery/ceramic in the study of wine history, and are there ways to study the history of wine in a pre-ceramic Near-East/Transcaucasia? 

Follow up: Ceramic/Amphorae/Qvevri are all the rage in Italy, Napa Valley and even Santa Barbara in making traditional, rustic, and sometimes orange (macerated white). What do you believe connects the past with the present, and why are we going back to these ancient fermentation techniques when science and technology have given us jacketed, temperature controlled stainless steel? 

Ian: What aspects of classical Greco-Roman wine culture do you believe most impacts the way we drink and enjoy wine today? 

Rob: The ancient world always whispers to me: ‚ÄòYou are Lucky to Drink Modern Wine‚Äô. I have said in lectures that ancient wine would likely be oxidized and rustic to the point where most modern wine drinkers would have pause or reject it. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong. How do you think a modern wine drinker would react to the wines of ancient Areni, the Near East, Egypt, Greece or Rome? 

Enough with ancient wine history. Let‚Äôs talk monkeys and fermentation. 

Ian: When did fermentation of sugar via glycolysis (fermentation) first occur? Tell us a little about your view of how yeast evolved and why they produce the alcohol that we love so much? 

Rob: How are our fruit-eating primate ancestors responsible for human beings being able to drink fermented beverages relatively safely and commonly? Is our love of wine a reflection of an ancient ‚Äòmonkey mind‚Äô? 

Ian: In studying the chemical and atomic structure of wine and fermentation, what have you discovered that changes the way you look at and appreciate a glass of wine today? 

Rob: Tough question for a shorter interview, but can you lead us through a basic understanding of the evolution of vitis vinifera vinifera, the perfected, hermaphroditic vine that produces the greatest wines the world over? 

Ian: How do you imagine the earliest Chalcolithic vineyards were propagated and managed? Were they in the forests, were there trellised, layered from wild vines, created from cuttings, seeds? 

Rob: You mention in your book that biologists are most fascinated by sex and death. Even though I may favor thoughts of one over the other while I sip Champagne, how do sex and death impact the natural history of wine? 

Ian: I love how in Chapter Eight, the Reign of Terroir, you posit that the extremely violent birth and development of earth is responsible for many wine flavors that are born from place. How do we get from meteor menaces to mineral Montrachet? 

Rob: Choose one of the 5 senses and describe how your scientific knowledge of that sense changes the way you experience wine. 

Ian: Choose another sense and do the same! 

Rob: Urartu, Xenophon, Pliny, Democritus, Louis Pasteur, Emile Peynaud, Maynard Amerine have all described and changed the way the world sees wine. Wine technology, in this Brave New World, gives us massive stacks of research and science, mostly ignored by most makers of fine wine. Sure, we‚Äôre only 170 years past Pasteur‚Äôs first scientific understanding of germ theory and fermentation kinetics, but there seems to be a strong counter-enlightenment inherent in wine production, for the purpose of rusticity, authenticity or a reluctance to change ancient methods. What do you make of winemakers reluctant to heed research, and if you were a winemaker, what tact would you take? 

Ian: A climate-change denier might argue what we are seeing right now is a cyclical pattern‚Äîthe ancient Romans made wine in England, almost up to the Scottish border! But what we are seeing today is more rapid and measurable change as well as technology and vine varietals that can even the playing field and guarantee at least our generation, and perhaps a few more, will have beautiful expressive wine from the traditional viticultural areas we celebrate today. What might you expect from the wine industry in 2070, 50 years from now? 

Rob: Anything to add from your crystal ball of science, as to the future of vineyards and wines? 

Gents:  Tell us how each and every viewer can get a copy of the Natural History of Wine.  I know it's available on Audible and the reading is very clear and good.

"Did my plum wine oxidize? Last week I degassed my plum wine. I did this by shaking the fermentation bucket until the bubbling in the airlock stopped, then did a taste test to double check. 

The concept behind this way is that the fermentation has pushed out all of the oxygen through the airlock so no oxidization will occur as there's mostly CO2 left in the airspace. I've successfully done this before with a gooseberry wine, and this method was suggested by my father who used to make wine when he was younger.

However the morning after I noticed the color in the wine had changed from that peachy pink color to a brown-yellow color with only slight pale notes of pink left (like the color inside a plum). I decided to leave it for another week thinking it might need to settle after all the shaking. But today, one week later, the color is still the same. I did a taste test, and it does not taste particularly oxidized, but there has definately been a slight aromatic shift towards caramel instead of the mild floral notes from the K1-V1116 yeast (but maybe that might simply be because there is no CO2 affecting the flavour?).

I'm starting to seriously doubt my father's methods in winemaking by now (this is not the only time I've wondered if he used to do things properly back in the days).

Has the wine oxidized, or could it just have lost some of the color because of the clearing process?",winemaking

"Possible unnoticed stuck fermentation? Hi all

So im making a batch of merlot, my first batch, and I wonder if I might have mistaken a stuck fermentation for the end of fermentation.  

The thing is that it was fairly warm for a few days when doing the ferment. Something like 75f/24c.  The fermentation was vigorous and I feel went quickly. Skins stopped rising and we decided to press and move it to a carboy 8 days after inoculating.  In the carboy it continued to produce gas for another week.  There were A LOT of lees so we racked it and moved on.  Then it seemed to taper off over another week and stop producing gas.   But at the same time the weather got a bit colder.   

&amp;#x200B;

So im looking back now and wondering... did it finish fermenting or did it actually stall?  its been about a month now and its no longer producing any gas and hasn't since after the second racking.   

&amp;#x200B;

What if it was just stalled?  Would I be able to add some starter and nutrients and see what happens?  Would that ruin the batch?  If its been stalled for a month is that going to ruin it?

"Best technique for a sweet wine? Hello! I‚Äôve been making wines now for about a year and have finally gotten to a point where I‚Äôm happy with most wines I make, however so far all of them have been dry wines. I wanna try my hand at some sweet ones, but reading up on it online I get a bit confused. I don‚Äôt want to make wines with more than 14% alcohol so it‚Äôs not really an option for me to add so much sugar that the years will die off and then i al left with some residue sweetness (plus I read that this method is quite unreliable because a lot of yeasts say they will reach 14% but will actually be stronger and go to even higher percentages). So I think I would need to back sweeten. But this process confuses me too, as I read you are in danger of fermentation starting up again. The methods that I found to prevent fermentation to start up again involve adding chemicals that mess with the flavor of the wine so also don‚Äôt seek ideal...

"Yeast globs or mold? Started my fourth ever batch of wine, blackberry, with 3 gallons of water and 15 pounds of blackberries. E1116 yeast, only used boiling water to sanitize equipment and fruit. Right from the start it was problematic. Bucket that was primary fermenter was almost over flowing, and did overflow a few times when the lees rose to the top. Racked it into carboys after 4 days. Didn't have enough small carboys so ended up with a 1 gallon one that is 1/4 full. Tons of crushed blackberry pulp in the carboys still. Went to rack today after two weeks and discovered the picture.

"Troubleshooting Carbonated Bottle Opened a 2 month old bottle today and it was slightly carbonated and under a bit of pressure.

Im trying to figure out the source of the carbonation, I'm leaning towards bacterial infection but I want to hear other people's thoughts. 

I bottled it after it cleared up in secondary, this only took about a month after primary finished. The FG was 0.996 which I read twice one week apart so Im confident it was complete. I bottled it dry (no back sweetening) and degassed before bottling. I opened a bottle after one month and all was good, obviously a young wine but I like to see how they progress. Opened another at 2 months and the corked popped out a bit more aggressively and the wine is a bit effervescent. Tasted just like the one month bottle once I swirled the carbonation out.

"Making Umeshu(Japanese Plum Wine) and having trouble sourcing ingredients this time of year Does this look too long and you don't want to read? Just read this: I'm trying to find green plums to make plum wine and I'd like some advice finding a source and/or opinions on the sources I have found in my rudimentary searches. Also, how high quality should plums for this project be? I've heard varying opinions.

Not sure if this is the right place since it isn't *exactly* fermented wine, but it is kept in a jar for an extended period of time to allow flavors to mingle, and it *is* called a wine in my language so I figure it might be worth making a post.

Basically, I'm trying to make some of this plum wine for my friend whose birthday will be in several months, as I know it's one of her favorite alchoholic drinks but she has trouble finding some at a decent price. So I think making a bottle or two of the stuff as a gift would be fairly thoughtful. I'm making it now and not in the season when the plums for this are typically available because A) the thought didn't occur to me until recently and B) if I were to wait, the wine probably wouldn't be done in time, as my understanding is it takes 6-12 months to do its thing properly.

The problem here is that the plums to make this are slightly unripe green plums, which I understand are available more in the range of may-july, not three months later in October. So I'm trying to see if I can find some out of season online. I've found a few sources that seem somewhat trustworthy on Etsy and Amazon, but I'd love feedback from other people who've done something similar on these sources so that I can try to find the best ones.

I'm also somewhat concerned as to whether or not this is even possible, as some sources tell me that the plums should be 100% free of blemishes, and others tell me it doesn't matter so long as the fruit isn't clearly rotting or severely over-ripe (which is my experience with other 'long-haul' projects like this).

As I removed the airlock, I noticed the bung was stuck. No biggie I thought, it can't be that tight. So my dumb brain decides its an okay idea to use a plastic chopstick to wedge into the hole at an angle to pull it out. This chopstick had previously been washed with normal dish soap, but not sanitized.  (The only time I've slipped up on cleanliness). As you can imagine, it snapped a small piece into the wine. Feelsbadman. 

After freaking out, I use a cork opener to carefully insert at a straight angle, fitted it at a diagonal and pulled the bung out without any damage. After adding my reserve and clearing agent I refitted the gear (fully sanitized). 

My question is going to be a subjective one: am I fucked? What are the odds this plastic piece will ruin my batch? 

Not too concerned about flavor being ruined. Also should include that the SG was at 1.00 yesterday when I racked into the carboy. So If I'm not mistaken, there's still a wee bit of fermentation to take place.

"71B and H2S I recently used Lalvin 71b for the first time, in a strawberry wine (the berries were in the freezer since June).  I've read that 71B is a low sulfur producer, has low nutrient requirements, and generally is an easy-to-work-with yeast.  For me it's kicking out sulfur like it has Montrachet-envy.  I added ~1.5x the dose of nutrients (~1x+0.5x) and fermented in a pot covered with a loose-fitting lid (plenty of O2), so not sure what's the beef.  I didn't measure the pH for this one.  Fermentation was in the basement, which is ~19degC (66F) this time of year, so while I didn't track the temperature, I'd guess it was between 22 and 25 degC.

I sulfited the must, and waited 24h.  Then I sprinkled 1/3rd of the packet on top of the 6l of 19 Brix must and added 3.5g Tronozymol (manufacturer states 3g/5l).  Maybe skipping rehydration was a mistake, though usually a third of a packet sprinkled is plenty for small batches of medium-strength must.  It took over 24h to start, but 36h later it was kicking.  A day later I started smelling H2S, so I added a bit over a gram of Tronozymol.  That took care of the stink for maybe 6-12h, but it returned and I was reluctant to add more Tronozymol, since I don't know exactly what's in it and what's the safe limit.  I was out of DAP, so couldn't see if it would've helped.  Degassed normally (3x day) and let it go.  It got close to finishing in a few days, still stinking.  Now it's in a jug, pretty finished, and still stinking.  I'm planning to let the trub settle for a day or three and then rack and splash like crazy to try to get the stink out.

Anyway, has anyone else encountered lots of H2S with 71B, even when fermenting open and going well beyond the manufacturer's recommended nutrient dose?",winemaking

"Have you seen barrel posts on FB/Offerup/CL for $60? Is there something wrong with using those barrels? Around late fall, and spring time, I've been seeing people posting ""once used, premium wine barrels"" for $60. Most of the time, they're advertised to use in half planters or to make lawn furniture.

"Question on flavour after fermenation has stopped I picked and washed 12lbs of blackberries and started some blackberry wine about 6 weeks ago.  I moved it from primary fermentation (bucket) to secondary (3 gallon carbuoy), I was going to rack it again to clear it now that it seems fermentation has stopped.  I have a few questions/confirmations.

1) My hydrometer reading is basically at 0.99 (was hard to read but I assume that is correct?) I will measure again next week to confirm its the same, it was almost below the possible readings on the hydrometer.  Is that normal? I forgot to take an initial reading but I took one a week in and it was 1.04.

2) I have a full 3 gallon carbuoy and a 1 gallon filled 3 gallon carbuoy. Today I used the 1 gallon one to top up the 3 gallon one after fermentation as the neck went down a bit (first time I opened either one), and was going to just bottle the partially filled carbuoy to free up and clean the carbuoy tomorrow and rack the full one to remove sediment.  At this point I assume once racked, I just need to pop in a campden tablet and call it a day while it stores for 6 months with a sealed bung?

3) We tasted a bit from the 1/3 filled carbuoy and it was definitely alcohol but had a bit of a tart finish.  Is this tartness from the yeast/sediment, and will it dissipate after racking/ageing? I liked the dryness but was curious how to smooth it out a bit.

"First attempt at winemaking from grapes Hi guys
I‚Äôm wondering whether this is worth taking a shot at or not.  I had a few questions.
First, is the flavor and quality of the finished wine going to be anything like I can buy at the store?  
I‚Äôm going to have to get some help to track down any fancy supplies (I‚Äôm in Japan).  I‚Äôm also not keen on spending tons of money on this.
The grapes I have to work with are from my sweet table grapes Pione vine. Most are edible but not completely ripe. Fairly sweet, very juicy, with a slight acrid nature. Grapes are just starting to turn color.  Not going to get much more ripe.  I likely have a couple of more weeks until all the leaves are dead.
Some of the grapes also have what appears to be scale, with sticky residue, soot from bugs. It‚Äôs a bit difficult to wash off.

Is it possible to make drinkable decent wine with this?

Can you recommend a simple easy guide for a beginner with the least amount of fancy equipment possible?

I looked at this guide, it‚Äôs quite complicated and appears to take a year until you can actually drink the wine.

"Grapefruit Wine Won't Ferment Looking for help / feedback. 

I'm making grapefruit wine according to some popular recipes on the internet. 6 grapefruits, gallon of water, 2.5lbs of sugar, etc. 

24 hours after putting in my campden tablets, and 12 hours after my depectenizer, I rehydrated K1-V116 exactly to the packets specifications. And then waited. No bubbles. After 24 hours of waiting I raised the heat in the house from 72 to 78, still nothing. 12 hours later I dumped in a packet of ICV-D47 hoping for something. It's about 6 hours later, and still have no movement. 

Before pitching more yeast I did another reading in the hydrometer. It had remained steady at about 1.088. I tasted it as well, and it didn't taste great. It tasted like grapefruit juice sitting on the counter for 3 days. It was delicious and refreshing when I first made the must, but now it's insipid and off. I know I added campden tablets, depectenizer, DAP, and yeast, so that may have affected the flavor? Still, I don't think it's going to make very good wine at this point. 

I'd like to throw it out and try again. But, I don't know where it went wrong. Here are my theories:

1. The yeast was bad? The yeast was not refrigerated. Maybe it got baked along the way?

My first 1 gallon batch of strawberry wine has just finished going through secondary.

"Wine is oily during MLF Hi guys, 

A long time lurker, but this is my first post. I am making my first batch of Merlot from fresh grapes this year, and I came across a strange problem during MLF. The wine in barrel (225L Bordeaux French oak) stays a little oily and kind of ""dirty"". If I was to apply a tissue the wine clears, same if I pour it into glass. The barrel drunk 2 litres of wine and I topped it off. I wonder if it was oxygen that caused this? As part of my routine the first few days I stirred the wine every day for a minute. 

The wine itself looks dirty and a bit oily, rather than a white film on top. 

I have only added 10ppm of SO2 before the MLF, and the wine appears to be very vulnerable. pH is 3.38 (before MLF kicked in it was 3.31), and TA is 8.2 g/L. The Merlot must was 24.1 brix before primary. 

What I did is to top off the barrel fully (even some of the wine entered the airlock. Apart from that, is there anything I can do before MLF is complete, or should I wait for MLF, rack off, add Kmeta and hope for the best?

It is a large batch and I hope I get to rescue it.

Anyway, the issue is, the guy running this place needs to be gone for a 3-4 day period, and he's insisting that it won't really be an issue to just leave it in the vat for this time.

Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This year i went with 1,5t of Merlot in five different barrels, two black barrels i used **Fruit** enzyme and in the other three, i used **He Grand Cru**. At this moment i am on the 8th day of fermentation, and it started to slow down a bit, the smell is great and the color. I added 690g of yeast nutrition, half of it at the start and half of it after 5th day, and i added 20-25g per 100kg of Yeast.

*My question is: When should i Filter it from the must?*

I plan to leave it till the 11th day, and maybe 2 more days after the fermentation stops, but i heard several colleague winemakers from my city, they keep it 21 days (10 days while it ferments and 10-11 days when it stops).

But i am afraid that the ""dead"" yeast will f\*ck something up.

*What should i watch for? How long should i keep it with the must?*

I prepared inox barrels one 560l, other 200l, and one more 260l, i also have the Rover pump, so basically, i am ready, but i would like to keep it a bit more, so it gets all those juicy thingies from the must as much as it can.

Has anyone ever tried pressing grapes with a dutch cheese press? I am curious if anyone has tried it and how well it works if anyone has. I built a dutch cheese press and would hope it works instead of having to buy or build a standard fruit press.

For anyone who isn't familiar a dutch cheese press looks like this: [dutch cheese press](https://imgur.com/a/7zaRZ4u).

"Whats your worst ""Bleach in a winery"" story, and the fallout because of it? I've started consulting for a few wineries and vineyards, and I've been surprised at the lack of knowledge regarding NEVER using chlorinated cleaners in production facilities and tasting rooms. It has made its way to the first question on my list when providing clients a free hour consultation.

Does anyone here have horror stories that they care to share in anticipation of COVID era Halloween?

When I was a young winemaker, I walked into the cellar of my employer, and got punched in the face with the smell of bleach. Active ferments, empty barrels, and palletized cases ready for cellaring were completely engulfed in a monstrous ball of chlorine gas. Following Toucan Sam's advice, I followed my nose to where I found a tasting room employee pouring a third bottle of drano into a clogged drain. I lost my shit on the poor, ignorant minion who was just following orders from an ignorant tastingroom manager; who was following orders from the owner of the winery. HR manager came to check out the commotion and found me mid-tirade and tried to yell me into submission. That didn't work because they learned quickly that the practice that they had been using to unclog drains was leading to the slow cancerous death sentence of their winery. I was a swearing wreckingball and no-one was safe. I got in contact with the owners, cursed them up and down for ruining the wines, and their business and promptly quit on the spot. 

A few years later, I found out from a friend that they hired a bunch of consultants to fix the mistake. Last I heard, the owners ended up building a separate production facility because 3 vintages of wine were suffering from TCA. They thought I had been a crazy exaggerating asshole, but it goes to show that you can't politely tell someone to not use Chlorine in their production facilities. I'd estimate hundreds of thousands of dollars in product, about 150 barrels, and an extra half million in new production area and wood. Next time you see chlorine; get angry.",winemaking
"Fermentation I've been making wine with my dad for two years and have been disagreeing with him. We buy Regina Grape Juice by 6gal buckets and he just pours them directly into a 15.5gal stainless steel kegs.. no yeast or anything and let's it ferment in there until it he feels fermentation is done and then seals it up for a few months and calls it a day.. no racking or anything.. sometimes it's good other times it's super cloudy..

I want to add yeast to the 6 gal buckets this year and let them ferment in the buckets and use a hydrometer to see when it's done then rack it with a electric transfer pump to avoid sediment. My question is should I airlock during primary fermentation or just put the lid on loosely. The regina buckets do have a pressure release rubber gromet on top of them. Anyways any help would be appreciated.. I am going to airlock the keg for secondary fermentation too just gotta find an rubber stopper big enough for the keg.

"UPDATE: Might have just ruined a $60,000 wine collection. Some may remember, about 4 months ago, I made a post describing how my cooler failed, and heated my cellar up to 113¬∞F / 45¬∞C, and as a result, may have cooked all of my wine.

Just wanted to update those that may have wondered, ""What ever happened to all that wine? ‚Äú

A lot of wine has been put in front of friends and family, a lot of wine has been put in front of the winemakers that made it, in front of colleagues. So far, nobody has been able to tell that anything bad happened. Once I explain the issue, they always tried again, and stuck with their assessment. I mean, if the person that made it says they can't taste the difference, I see no issue.

My observations:
Diam corks for the win! The only issues I found, were cork related. Wines with natural cork, definitely were dried out more than anything else. Natural corks were the only ones that had a little bit of bleed. A few natural wines were the worrisome lots, as they seemed to push the corks a bit, but upon tasting, no issues were observed. Diam corks stayed in place, only dried a little bit, and were the first to stabilize once the temperature and humidity was corrected. In total, I only lost two bottles. They were from the same lot, and was a no sulfite natural white wine. 

Only more time will tell, but in the meantime, we'll keep drinking.

"Adding grapes to a wine kit and campden tablets If I have enough grapes to make a gallon or so of juice, and want to add them to a wine kit for a fuller wine do I....

Make the 1 gal juice from the grapes, add 1 campden tab, let sit for 24 hours, pitch yeast. 

Or

Make the full 6 gallon kit, add 6 tablets, wait 24 and pitch yeast

Or 

mix the 6 gallons, but still only add one more tablet? 

The kit comes pretreated with its own sulfites, so the second option would double up on them.

"Trying a Natural Wine - Help/Advice Hi all - I‚Äôm a longtime beer home brewer, but completely new to the world of winemaking. Last week I got some Viognier grapes from my local shop, with the plan of making a natural wine ([as well as a beer/wine hybrid inspired by Jester King](https://embracethefunk.com/2020/04/28/inspiring-recipes-part-1/) which launched this whole project).

I had the grapes destemmed and crushed by my shop, measured the gravity (1.120, which seems high from what I‚Äôve read?), put them into a sanitized bucket and let it go. I‚Äôve been stirring/mixing 2x daily, but I‚Äôm not seeing any activity at all, and I was able to confirm that with a hydrometer today. Any thoughts? Am I doing something wrong, or does it just need a lot more time? I was thinking of pressing somewhere in the 2-4 week range, but again, I‚Äôm a complete newbie here.

I‚Äôm also completely willing to say this is ruined, dump it, and move on... I recognize that I went into this without any real knowledge outside of reading a few blogs and watching a few videos, but if there‚Äôs something salvageable or interesting here, I‚Äôd really like to keep it going!

"What can i grow along with grapes to form a ""green fence"" Hello All
I have a fence bordering the neighbours house that currently uses a shade cloth with a wire mesh backing as a privacy screen and is badly in need of repair or replacement. 
  
What I am hoping to do is use the existing fence posts to set up a trellis to grow grapevines as they are made from concrete and it requires very little effort. . However, I would also like to have an evergreen fence growing over the existing wire mesh fence to act  as a replacement  privacy screen.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what i could plant that would do the trick? It doesn't have to be a thick hedge nor does it have to be 100% effective as the current fence blocks the neighbpurs view of my shed.

"Requesting thoughts on Skeeter Pee early sample taste Is anyone familiar with how skeeter pee tastes right after fermentation completes? Please share your thoughts if you have tried this.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is some background to my question and by all means please ignore this if you want. I have for the most part followed the recipe at the end of this post with some variation, and now I realize there is an original recipe which varies from the one below. I started with 5.5 gallons in a primary bucket and Lalvin-ec1118 yeast and no fermentation happened initially. If I had to guess this was because of the k-metabisulfite in the lemon juice. After 5 days of no activity, I created another yeast starter and was able to get the fermentation going with no problem. I had the juice kept around 80-81 degrees Fahrenheit throughout fermentation. After 7 days of fermenting gravity is at .998 from the original 1.09. The starting ph was 2.95. Since fermentation seems to be complete or just about I racked into a carboy. I had extra for sampling and it seems to taste a bit like how nail polish smells. My plan is to let it clear and continue the recipe, but I'm curious what others with more experience may think. This is my third batch of wine and it has been a fun batch either way! I'm hoping this is not an acetic acid fault, but if I have to dump the batch at least it was cheap! Thanks in advance!!

The day after sealing it up and leaving it to ferment I could hear it bubbling away, the water in the airlock moved to one side and the lid started to protrude (dome over due to pressure if that makes sense!) But no actual bubbles in the airlock that I could see. 

Then the next day when I went to check it, it felt colder, the lid was back to normal and no sound of bubbles. 

It's been in our airing cupboard as I'm in the cold and wet UK so its the warmest place in the house.

"Advice needed :) - Four Week 5 Gal wine kit all in one bucket :s Kind of hoping this where some people sort of start off, so any experiences shared are appreciated!


What i know so far is my fermentation has gone fantastic, 5 gal wine kit in a brew-bucket, air lock etc etc 10 days in and starting to slow down.... once it hits the target SG im lost.


On purchase i was sold just one brew bucket with the wine kit, degassing and finings would all take place in the same bucket with no need to rack. 
Would take longer to clear due to sedement, but i have a filter so go straight from bucket to bottle in around 5-6 weeks. 


Youtube and instructions tell me not to clear wine in a bucket due to oxidation, glass or PET demijohn is needed, but dont specifically refer to shorter length wine kits. 

Long winded for a relatively short answer i know....

Do i risk ruining the wine by using one bucket, for the whole process over say 5-6 weeks including the clearing?

Is it worth racking a wine kit from one bucket to another just to get it off the sedement as next cheapest option?

If needed i was thinking a 5gal PET demijohn, its nearly the price of a 5gal wine kit round here and was never factored in, hence im after some suggestions :)",winemaking

"Will this wine work without adding sulphites? We're going to make plum dessert wine. However due to allergy we'll be baking the plums in the oven for an hour or so. This means that most microbes will probably get killed. We'll then use sterilized water, and use sanitizers on all vessels and equipment. So this batch will be almost as sterile as a batch of beer, the only active microbes being the added yeast. So does this mean we still have to add sulphites?

"A couple questions from a newbie Hey all!

  I'm a relatively new vintner. I started a couple years ago after I bought my house and discovered the grape vine and plum trees in the yard produce waaaay more fruit than I could ever eat. So I'm annually making white wine and plum wine now with all my bounty of fruit. I added a red grape last year and had a small harvest of those grapes this year as well. 

   So, I guess I have a few questions about procedure. I picked up Iodophor for my sterilizing agent, but I still feel like there's residual iodine smell even after I rinse the demijohns a couple times. Has anyone else had issue with this or noticed iodine aromas/flavors in their wine? Should I just switch to StarSan?

Also, it's been mainly smallish batches, a few gallons each year. But my harvests have kept getting bigger, so I'll need to start ramping up. So far, I don't have a corker and have just been reusing screw top wine bottles once they're empty. Anyone have experience with this in the long run? Do the screw top bottles last over the course over years or should I invest in a corker?
Any tips or hacks or anything you wish you'd known when you were first starting out would be much appreciated!

"""Natural"" Wine at Home I really like the taste of most natural wines, so trying to emulate the style for a Lambrusco I am making. Ideally, it will be a nice ""glou glou."" 

The recipe the brewing outlet gave me includes 1/4 tsp of potassium metabisulfite(I think that brings the 5 gallon to 50 ppm). Would using 1/8th be acceptable? How many ppm can we expect to be naturally occurring (I would love to keep mine overall below 35 ppm). 

Wine makers tend to leave off additives so I'm not sure if Potassium sorbate is common in natural wines? Is it a necessary addition and will it further raise the ppm of sulfites?

"Racking and Timing When I started batches of mead and wine earlier this year, I racked off the lees that had formed when my batches were at the halfway point. Fermentation stalled in all the batches afterwards, and the impression I got from that experience and the responses online was that this was a bad decision that only outdated sources recommended, and that I shouldn't rack at all until terminal gravity was reached. Now I'm working with fruit meads using Lalvin 71B and what I'm reading online is that this *should* be racked a few days after fermentation starts to get it off the initial lees and avoid off flavors that 71B is known for.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the hard rules for racking during fermentation, if any? Is it better in general to let  fermentation finish completely before racking while 71B and certain yeasts are worth racking partway through?

2. To keep temps up in the 50¬∞-59¬∞ F range.

"Experiences with Pet Nat Has anyone experimented with pet nat? What did you do? How did it turn out? 

Background on this is that my family picked up a bit of chardonnay last weekend as a side project to our other winemaking. It was supposed to be at 23 brix, but it came in at 19.5. Our operation is pretty sophisticated as home wine making goes, but not enough that we have the set up for actual champagne, which would be the ideal lemonade to make from these particular lemons. 

 It's also interesting because we had some accidental pet nat this summer thanks to a stuck fermentation that stubbornly stayed right at just under 1% RS and then decided to restart after bottling, leading us to have to decant 14 cases of chardonnay and then rebottle. (gah. If we'd intended it, it would have been perfect, we had amazingly well entrained bubbles). Might as well try to do it on purpose this time, with the right bottles.

As in, instructions recomend topping concentrated grape juice up to 23 litres, I top it 20 ltrs. I have found yes you get a couple less bottles but the bottles you do get are much more flavourful and slightly stronger in alcohol. 

However my most recent kit has resulted in 20 litres of wine that‚Äôs 16/17% ( I added a couple cups of sugar also) I‚Äôd prefer it to be around 13/14%. 
So my question is if I want to water it down, how much water would I need to add. 
I have used Pearsons Square and it suggests 3 litres which is what the instructions specified to start with ffs...

Would I need to boil and cool tap water, or use bottled water. I read somewhere that to dilute wine you should use distilled water due to the oxygen content of tap/bottled water?
Any help would be appreciated",winemaking

"apple wine ended quite dry, then spoiled when I tried to add spices (xpost to /r/homebrewing) So I finally broke my cherry and had a brew go so bad that I ended up tossing the batch. It was a dead simple apple wine (literally just juice, sugar, premier cuvee yeast). It was salvageable at first, just way too dry. Then I decided to add some spices (vanilla extract, half a cinnamon stick and 2 whole cloves) during secondary. The brew developed some really off flavors and bitterness. So I'm wondering what I could do differently when I try again in order to prevent this. My first thought was to cook the cinnamon and clove into the simple syrup I made with the apple juice and sugar, then pull the whole spices out and just let primary fermentation take its course. I'm thinking that the actual pieces of cinnamon and clove started breaking down and adding a bitterness to my brew. As far as being too dry, I don't wanna campden tab it then backsweeten because my original intention was to prime it in the bottle and serve it sparkling, but a friend who brews for a living suggested nonfermentable sweeteners right in the primary, particularly brown sugar. He also suggested switching from premier cuvee yeast to US-05 Chico yeast. Does anyone have any experience with trying to sweeten sparkling wine or beer with nonfermentable sugars and/or brewing with spices? If so, does this seem like a reasonable plan?

"Newbie wine-making questions. I'm new to making wine and I make small batches at home. With the amount of resources available online, I'm very confused at the moment. Here are some of my questions:


1. From what I understand, primary fermentation is the part where the yeast multiply and to be able to do this properly they need air. So we're not supposed to completely seal the container with an airlock (one-way air valve). But then again, without the seal and airlock, the wine is left open to contamination. How should I approach this?



2. Is yeast nutrient absolutely necessary?..even when I'm adding sugar to the mix?



3. What alternatives to commercially available yeast nutrient can I make myself at home?



4. I read online that one of the reasons we leave out the lees/sediments when racking into secondary is because the dead yeast can degrade and give an off-flavour to the wine. But yeast nutrient contains dead yeast. So... isn't the same as keeping the lees while transferring to secondary?",winemaking

"[Fruit Wine] First time wannabee with a ton of questions Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've picked a bunch of raspberries and plums in my neighborhood and soon a ton of apples will also be available. I'd like to get started making fruit wine but after spending tens of hours researching, I still have A LOT OF (well 10) questions. I hope you guys can help me with a few of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if some of these have already been answered. If this is the case and you can provide me a link, I would be very grateful!

&amp;#x200B;

1) Is there a ""fruit wine bible""? 

\- Is anyone aware of a comprehensive book that will teach me everything?

&amp;#x200B;

2) How much fruit for how much water?

\- I have seen wild differences across recipes. My understanding is that the more fruit the better and if possible I should even not add any water at all. Is there anything I need to look out for or is more always better?

3) What's the deal with acid?

\- So say I've submerged my fruit in a minimal amount a water with Campden for 24h.

\- Next step I would check for acidity using a pH testing strip (not the most precise but more affordable). I would aim to be between 3.8 and 3.4. I can higher the acidity with wine acid or lemon juice and lower acidity with water.

\- Which acid should I choose (citric, lactic, tartic, a mix) and why does it matter? Also, what difference does it make if I'm at 3.4 or 3.8 (or even 3 vs 4)?

4) How much sugar and when?

\- Next I can take a gravity reading of the liquid and add the called-for sugar.

\- However, since I would also add pectic enzymes at that moment, my fruit will ""liquidate"" more. Is my initial gravity still accurate (or close enough that it doesn't matter)?

\- Second, say I've chosen a yeast with an alcohol tolerance of 14%. If I add the required amount of sugar, the fermentation will be complete and I will have a dry wine. I've read that fruit wine are recommended to be made sweet and not dry. Will I need to add sugar once fermentation is over or should I add more sugar to begin with? Does it matter?

5) Do I need tannins?

\- I have seen recipes calling for store-bought wine tannins, a big mug of very dark tea or nothing. I've read that tannins are important for the wine flavour but require longer aging. What do I need to know to figure out the kind and quantity of tannins I want to add?

6) How many times should I rack?

\- I've seen recipes with a single rack while others rack every 30 days for 6 months+. What do I need to understand to make my own decision?

7) Is bentonite useful?

\- I saw that it is use to ""clarify"" the wine. It's really not expensive so I figure I would use it. However, I don't see it mentioned very often in recipes. Does it actually bring any value?

8) What is sorbistat?

\- I know it is used to stabilize the wine when bottling and needs to be used in conjunction with Campden tablets. However, most recipes ignore this and just use Campden. Can sorbistat just be disregarded?

9) Can I age my wine in a carboy?

\- Most recipes just rack the wine from 1 carboy to another while fermentation is happening. Once fermentation has finished (verified by a gravity reading), they bottle the wine for aging. Can I age my wine directly in a carboy? It just seems to be a more practical storage vessel.

10) How long do I need to age the wine for?

\- Again, some recipes have the wine ready to drink in about 40 days while others recommend to wait 2 years. What does aging do? How do I know if the wine is ready? What should I expect?",winemaking

So say you had a start SG of 1.115 (for a potential abv of 15.6) and yeast that could survive say 12%, you would have some sugar left over after reaching 12% abv when the yeast would die off. 

This i think should leave about 238g of sugar in a 1 gallon batch. Thats aabout 17g per glass. Should be pretty sweet.",winemaking

"Hows this sound? (Peach wine recipe) So i just started some peach wine. Was planning on raspberry-blackberry, but farmers market only had peaches. 

&gt;Ingredients:

&gt;-about 6.5lb of peaches, maybe a little more

&gt;-500g of honey 

&gt;-12oz sugar 

&gt;-about a liter of spring water

&gt;-1/4tsp tannins 


So, i chopped and blended the fruit, added it plus a liter of water, 500g honey? 1 campden tablet, and 1 tbsp of pectic enzyme to the primary fermenter. 

I let that sit for 24 hours and then strained the mix and re-sanitized my equiptment. 

Specific gravity was 1.06 qand ph 3.28. So took 12 grams of sugar and a little more honey and simmered with water before adding to the must. This gave me a sg of 1.94

So then checked the ph again and used potassium bicarb to bring it to 3.52. 

Then i topl 125ml water and warmed it up  and added 6g of Goferm and the yeast, let it mellow a few minutes and pitched it. 

Plan to let it go for about 5 days and check the sg at that point and go till 1.03. Then move to secondary fermenter till 0.99

"A warning: Butterfly pea blossom tea So I've brewed a lot of wine in my time, and the standard fruit wine has become boring, so I decided to experiment with butterfly pea blossom tea as a way of both colouring the wine and giving it some body.

For those of you who aren't aware of this, it's a flower that is bright blue when brewed with pH neutral water, but turns purple when an acid is added to it. I was trying to make a bright purple berry wine.

I have just come round to the idea of boiling fruits rather than mashing them, as I still don't have a fruit press.

So I decided to boil up these fruits with some butterfly pea blossom tea. The colour was amazing, it was like crystal royal purple! Very happy. I did my brew, put it down to ferment and washed my equipment.

7 days later someone offered me nearly 3kg of banana. Perfect for a 5 litre batch of banana wine, and although plain at this point, 5 litre is 5 litre. Grabbed my brewing kettle and started boiling the banana and noticed something weird. The water was turning grey, almost like aluminium.

I decided to ignore this and put the boiled fruit and juice in a bucket overnight with some pectic enzymes and some campden tablets. I'm sure after boiling for 30 minutes, I'd kill any extra bacteria or yeast but better safe than sorry.

The next day, the banana water mixture was still gray but no off flavours at all, pure banana water. The OG was far to low so I decided to add some sugar and boil it again. This time there was this weird flouting matter at the top that was the same colour as the water. I started skimming it off and suddenly the water underneath was a darkish yellow, much as you'd expect from banana wine!

Turns out that the pectic enzymes and the boiling bought all the loose butterfly pea blossom particulates to the top! Guess I didn't wash it out as well as I had thought.

Tldr; if you use butterfly pea blossom in your boiled brew, make sure to thoroughly wash the pot, and boil a full pot of water before your next brew, or you could end up with some very bad colourations.",winemaking

Is there a way to leave yeast in the bottle but reduce the amount of lees produced?

3. The methods I‚Äôve read about for making sparkling wine at home consist of either fermenting in the bottle or forcing carbonation like soda; are there other methods out there?

"Help with cranberry wine, repeated stuck fermentation Good afternoon all,

I started with a preservative free 100% cranberry juice. I used 2 qts of juice and 2 qts of water plus a couple lbs of dextrose (corn sugar) and 2 tsp DAP/Urea. Very vigorous fermentation for 4 days as you would expect of a primary. SG was around 1.092. Tasted after a week...very very sweet. I don't have the gravity written down but I think it was maybe 1.078-ish. Tons of sugar left. I waited 2 more weeks...very little bubbling and not appreciable change in sg. I added more DAP/Urea and got very vigorous fermentation for a week and then just a trickle. I left it for 6-weeks. It is still sweet and very very yeasty/rotten fruit tasting. SG is lower...less sugar, but it is stuck again.

"I am so extremely new to this and had no idea how much I didn't know. I'd appreciate some insight from anyone with the patience to help a total newbie! I've never looked into making wine before. I have very little basis of knowledge beyond the basic wine classes I took as a server. My husband bought way more peaches than we could use, so on a whim I looked up a peach brandy recipe (that is, of course, actually just a peach wine since there's no distilling involved) and bought a few gallon fermenting jars.

I made it last night. I peeked at it a few times today and realized I have no idea what I'm looking for, so it could be going great or horribly wrong and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I figured I should probably find the winemaking sub and look around. Holy crap. Skimming a few posts, I am so lost. I don't have any tools beyond my fermenting jars. I didn't use any special wine-making ingredients or additives. I used about 3 quarts of peaches cut into probably 8-10 wedges each, skin on, pits included per the recipe. 4lbs of sugar, tap water, and dry active yeast that I keep for bread making. The recipe said to layer the ingredients and didn't mention stirring in the first stage. It said to check on it after a week, stir, and repeat for four weeks, and then it's done. 

Okay, well, I do have some slow bubbling (a blub every 30 seconds or so) and obvious foaming, but everything is separated into layers. Should I intervene and stir it in until the sugar dissolves? I've looked around at a few works-in-progress and none of them look like mine.

"Grape batch losing flavor in secondary ... normal? First time covid wine kit maker here with a question!

I made a batch with 6 pounds of wild grapes but added a significant amount of water and sugar to get it to a certain starting acidity and gravity (following a recipe, probably ill-advised). I tasted it out of primary and it had decent, though not super rich flavor. It's been in secondary 3 days and the flavor is totally sapped. It's almost like a La Croix with light hints of grape. Lovely. Is this normal, or is it totally messed up and I should consider dumping?

I have two new batches going one that I'm using 20 pounds of grape and not adding water or sugar so I have higher expectations for that one.

The color of this batch also seems too light for grapes?

"Popping my Homebrew cherry Popping my Homebrew cherry

Hey reddit, posting my first two attempts at home brewing here. 


1) Blackberry and Muscadine Wine....
Okay I know this is an odd mixture but I had my first year of harvest from my blackberries, and still needed some weight in fruit for a one gallon batch. My brother just moved into a house in which the previous owner was growing muscadine grapes so I thought ‚ÄúPerfect, more home grown fruit for free.‚Äù Purely an experiment and using it as my first try to get down the basics
I did the standard must with fruit, sugar, water, and I even made a trip down to my local brew shop and bought some pectic enzyme because I was feeling spunky.
It is currently in its first few hours of primary fermentation, more to come.

2) Clover Honey Mead
I had an extra carboy and airlock from my original equipment order so I decided why not. I got some pretty standard honey from the market and mixed it with the water at about 3lbs to the gallon. My plan is to do a mocha mead later on in secondary fermentation by adding whole beans and cocoa nibs. 
This is my total mess-around-and-see-what-happens jug of mead

Yeast: Lalvin Bourgovin RC-212

"Carbonating and canning Ros√© TLDR: should I add sulfites and force carbonate or skip them and re-ferment with priming sugar in the can?

Long version: I‚Äôve been making beer for about 15 years, but recently I decided to try my first wine. I bought a Winexpert Grenache Ros√© kit (I only got an OG of 1.060‚Ä¶no idea why, seems way too low‚Ä¶ and the Lalvin 71B packet was old and hard‚Ä¶so I saw no signs of fermentation for over 2 days and ended up buying a fresh packet from the homebrew store‚Ä¶I probably will never buy a kit from this company in the future but‚Ä¶I digress..) and it‚Äôs now, finally bubbling away.

I‚Äôm making this because I enjoy drinking a canned sparkling Ros√© (Underwood is the brand) on mountain climbing trips up here in Alaska. I recently bought a can seamer from my beer, and thought I‚Äôd try to do it with a wine.

I‚Äôve been using priming sugar with my beers and re-fermenting in the can.

However, the late dosing of sulfites in wine gives me pause. What would be the best way to do this? A) Add the sulfites, condition, then re-add more yeast at canning along with priming sugar or B) don‚Äôt add the sulfites at all and prime in the can with sugar just like a beer.

Or, should I just rack the wine into a keg, force carbonate, then can from the keg and be done with it?

"Does this recipe sound relatively ok? First time making wine. Planning on a 1 gallon batch of blackberry-raspberry wine. Heres what i'm planning on using:

-3 lb blackberries/2lb raspberries (total 5lb fruit)

-water to make 1 gallon

-sugar as needed for a starting specific gravity around 1.95

-pectic enzyme the break down fruit, acid blend to bring to ph to 3.2 to 3.5, metabisulphate to clean fruit and equitment; bentonite to clear

I'll mash the fruit with pectic enzyme and let rest for 12 hours. 

Add fruit/sugar/water/metabisulfate to the primary fermenter and rest for 24 hours to kill bacteria/wild yeast. 

Add the yeast after the 24 hours and let it do its thing for around 5 days till specific gravity is 1.03. 

Transfer to secondary fermentor and ferment for about 3 weeks till 1.00 sg.

"Used too much water in plum wine must. Can I use jam to ""thicken'"" it up? So long story short, I made 2 batches of plum wine: one with wild yeast, one with cultured red wine yeast.

For the first one, I barely used any water, SG was around 1.040 before I added some honey.

However, for the 2nd one, I wasn't thinking straight, and I added some warm water to thaw the plums, then I added some more water with the pectic enzyme, then even more water with the yeast starter. So much so, that the SG here was only 1.020 before the honey. This 2nd batch even had less plum (per weight) as the 1st one. So I'm kinda worried that I diluted it too much.

On the bright side, we have some homemade plum jam from the same trees, so I'd be able to use the same plums; question is, is it okay to use jam for this? Or did, let's say, the boiling of the jam added something to it that wouldn't be pleasant for a wine? Or will it actually make it less diluted? Thanks!",winemaking

1) my understanding is that specific gravity taken before fermentation tells you approx how much sugar is present. Is this right?

2) do you take the SG of the juice only or of the entire contents of the primary fermenter just before fermenting? (So juice alone vs juice+water+possibly sugar)

"Mixing wild yeast with cultured yeast in plum wine? Might be a stupid question, but it's the first time I'm making wine.

Wild yeast wasn't a choice here, but the must tasted really good so I kept going with that, hoping the yeast would die off at around 4-5% alcohol. I  kept adding honey, and now, if my calculations are right, it's around 8.5% and the wild yeast is still vigorous, and eats up everything **rapidly**... it might even be able to go up to 14%. However, I still want to use the cultured yeast, as I know  for sure that it would help with malolactic fermentation, which I  desperately need (my plums has 3x more malic acid than regular plums...  pH was close to 2... but now it's better, thanks to calcium carbonate).  

So, if I made another batch (with cultured yeast), could I just siphon this somewhat-fermented must (with the wild yeast) into my new batch? Like 25% every third day. 

My cultured yeast is a ""killer yeast"", but the wild yeast could also be just beer yeast (US-05, which is kind of a beast) that got stuck on the wall from my previous batches. That would also explain why it's it's so vigorous and rapid with the honey I've added to it. Anyway, it (apparently) has a high alcohol tolerance, and I definitely would not want to go as high where I could risk the health of my cultured yeast. Any ideas? Thanks!",winemaking

"dealing with oak chips So, i want to oak in my carboy because it is way easier to get all the air out with the narrow neck compared to the wide mouth of my primary fermenter.  the problem is, to get the chips out i would like to be able to scoop them off the top before racking once it is done.  however, with the narrow opening that isnt really practical.

This is my first time oaking with chips, so there are a few ways i imagine this going down, and i do not know which is true:

1) no problem at all.  the chips just float and do not get in the way of racking.

2) make some kind of tube to hold the chips in, with little holes drilled.

"Red wine kit Question/Help I have been making wine for about 5 years. Lots of different styles, and varieties. From skeeter pee, to fruit wines, cider, and Mead. I've also purchased a bunch of different wine kits. RJ spagnols, and Eclipse kits mostly. I've liked everything I've made so far, except the red wines. I've made some pretty good white wines from kits, but the red usually either taste bland or they smell a bit off.

The last two kits I made were the eclipse stag's leap merlot, and the Lodi Cab. Both of them had a faint to mild ester smell. The wrong kind of fruity smelly. Not all together off putting, but nothing something I would want to produce again. Generally the red I've made from kits taste like really cheap, slightly sweet (FG was at 1) 5-6 dollar value wines at the liquor store. 

I've generally used the provided yeast, EC1118, and follow the kit instructions. They ferment in the basement, it is usually in the mid 60's for temp. They all get bulk aged, and I've waited at least a year to drink any of them. I have one near year 4 that is still pretty meh tasting. 

So, is this how all the red kits turn out? Or am I a failure? Anyone have any tips to get better?

I have another unused red kit I received as a gift to give this one more shot. There is really only so many bottles of cooking wine I can make before throwing in the towel.",winemaking

My wine stopped at 1.003g/L and not at the expected 0.990g/L that I've learned is the rough common ending point for wine fermentations.

My OG was 1.085g/L, and seems to have settled at 1.003g/L as if there is no sugar left to ferment, which I find confusing.

I personally like to make my wine on the dryer side but I do recognize that people have different tastes and may desire a sweeter wine.  My question is more to gauge how to do this without adding straight sugar.

"Kit with grape skins ABV question Starting off a WE Eclipse Cab/Zin blend with grape skins, and as I tested the initial SG per the instructions, I had a question: is there a better time to test for initial SG than immediately after adding the skins? I would think that the bag of skins adds quite a bit of fermentable sugars, but they wouldn‚Äôt be immediately added to the must and so wouldn‚Äôt be measured when you take that first SG reading (kit instructions have you add the skins, take SG reading, and then immediately pitch the yeast). 

My thinking is that by doing exactly as the instructions say, you will end up with a lower ABV calculation than is actually present in the wine because of the additional sugars from the skins; I don‚Äôt know how big a difference that would actually make, since the bag of skins is about 1L volume compared to 16 or 17 for the juice bag, but it‚Äôs gotta make some difference, yeah?",winemaking

The wine has been sitting at 16C in a dark cellar, with the proper amount of sulfites and the needed nutrients added at the start of the fermentation, sitting at pH 3.8 just a few days prior.

Should I grab a packet of EC-1118 yeast to finish off the rest, or is there something else that I can try first?

"Question on land for vinyard/orchard Hi folks.  For many years I've been dreaming about moving out of the neighborhood we currently live in and out to a decent size chunk of land that we could plant a vineyard and an orchard on.  I realize that doing both of these will be costly ventures and that they will take time to start producing usable fruit.  One of the things Im concerned about is property taxes on the land.  I live in MN and the property taxes are rather high.  I currently pay almost 8k a year just for the half acre house and lot we live in which is in a pretty rural area.  That said, I've been looking into the agricultural homestead tax break that's available and that farmers typically use.  I imagine that an orchard or a vineyard would fall into the bucket of what's considered agricultural, but when I called the assessor he told me that for the ag homestead you need to have 10 acres of land that was ""producing"".  My concern is that the land we're looking at currently is just a field (they are leasing it currently to some government CRP program so the property is already ag homesteaded but we would cancel that if we bought it).  For us to be able to plant 10 acres will take Im guessing a least a year or two.  And even after that, we wont be ""producing"" fruit for quite awhile.

Does anyone have experience with how this might work?  I have another call with the assessor next week where Im going to ask some more questions.  For instance, Im not sure if we need to be producing a product and selling it (we wanted to start small and likely not go commercial right away even once we were making fruit) to qualify for ag homestead.  And if so - do they expect us to show receipts or something each year to keep the classification?

If anyone has dealt with this and has an insight I'd appreciate it.  The property Im looking at currently has very reasonable property taxes because of ag homestead but if we bought it and lost that classification I think it would be extremely expensive.",winemaking

"I might have messed my very first wine... could use some help... So, this is my first time ever making a wine. We have about 970 plum trees, so I decided to make plum wine from the ""leftovers"" we kept for personal use. For my batch I used about 20Kg (44 lbs) of absolutely beautiful, ripe, perfect plums (ƒçaƒçanska lepotica).

First day, I took them out from the freezer, put them in my fermenter bucket, and added some luke warm water and campden tablets. Second day I added pectic enzyme, but instructions said 'wait 24hrs before pitching yeast'. At that time I already aerated the must because I wanted to pitch my yeast, but I thought, whatever I will pitch tomorrow... 

Today, when I went out to check the bucket, I saw it fermenting VIGOROUSLY. Or at least that's what I think. I cannot imagine pectic enzyme being this vigorous after 20-22hrs... When I aerated it, I probably 'helped' it get some wild yeast infection.

Being in panic, I immediately dropped in some more campden tablets. I could have pitched my yeast, as it is supposed to kill wild yeast, but it was bubbling and foaming so wildly, that I was afraid that my packed yeasty couldn't kill that much wild ones (or let alone get acclimated and start multiplying...) 

I brewed quite a few beers before, and never had any problems. But boiling and the hops also help to disinfection, so...  
Was that the right decision to add campden now? Or should've I added my yeast on top of the wild yeast?  
I'd appreciate any inputs.... cheers",winemaking

"Wine left sitting because of Covid19 lockdown. Best way to check current dissolved SO2 levels? I made 60 litres of wine and was a week a way from bottling when Ireland went into full lockdown. So instead of aging in glass bottles, it sat in plastic bottling buckets for what's been now a few months.

I had put in the recommended level of sulfides just before the lockdown began but on account of the plastic being somewhat permeable I'm concerned that some of the free SO2 has been used up.

The wine is a big Malbec so I had intended to let it sit in bottles for possibly 1-3 years. From what I've read, I believe the wine should last in a bottle for about a year with the amount of sulfides I had already applied, but I'd like to be on the safe side and confirm it in a somewhat scientific manner.

I've seen instruments listed online for about 20 euro that say they can measure the dissolved SO2, but I've always seen paper strips as well. What's the recommended tool? I'm happy enough to spend 20-30 euro, but not interested in say a 100 euro instrument (unless it can do more than just SO2).

"Just used a fruit press for the first time I just wanted to share my recent experience. 

I have a batch of cherry wine that I started  on the 18th, and I needed to move out of primary into secondary. just as a little bit of background. my process is normally to start the ferment in a bucket, then after 7-10 days transfer it to a 6.5 gal carboy for 1-2 weeks, then rack into a 6 gal. carboy to let it age. 

Now, I've had a run of bad luck with transferring from the bucket to the carboy, as the fruit seems to clog the siphon and I need to keep cleaning it out, or that I have to strain the leftover pulp to get the last bit of juice. Now I've spent more then a few hours with fruit in a metal strainer and a spoon mashing the last few drops of wine I could from the mash, and I swear I'm never making another batch of fruit wine every time I do it. However recently I got a 5 gal fruit press in that I was going to use to make cider. I wasn't going to use it at first, as i thought it was going to be overkill, and cherry wine shouldn't clog the siphon to much right...

Well after 20 minutes and 2 gallons of wine siphoned out, I decided to give it a shot. I cleaned the press with some one step and starsan, slowly poured the wine/must into the press (making sure to overload the sides only once), and started tightening down. 

Y'all, I love this fruit press so much. I was able to press out a full 6 gallons of wine from the fruit, and normally I'd be scooping the must and mashing it in a strainer for an hour to get what I got in 15 minutes. That and cleaning it up was a breeze. 

I don't know why I didn't order one sooner (well I do know, it was a little over $100 to get, that's why), but it's a game changer. It's one of those quality of life upgrades that will make my life a lot easier.

"Some finer points of bottling from portless stainless fermenter ... So ... I have a 12 gallon portless, stainless fermenter filled with Pinot Noir.  I am going to attempt bottling.

In short, I am sanitizing the bottles, and then using a bottle filler and a racking cane (and some tubing) and siphoning the wine  into the bottles, then corking.

Seems simple enough ... some random questions, though ...

\- Do I do a final sulfuring before bottling ?  Or put any sulfur into the bottle itself ?

\- Does anyone sanitize bottles with boiling water instead of starsan, etc. ?  Seems like a lot of work to fill and then properly rinse all the bottles - if I boiled water, I just do the rinsing step ...

\- Are there measuring bottle fillers ... like, they let 750ml pass and they auto stop ?  Or do I just need to eyeball the neck of the bottle and try to get the level right ?

\- Does anyone dump CO2 into the bottles prior to filling to avoid air contact while filling and to make the tiny headspace in the bottle oxygen free ?

I am not going to bottle all of it - I am going to bottle half (unoaked) and then throw some oak cubes into the remaining wine and age it with the cubes for another month or three ... and then bottle it  Just for comparison.

Fermentation was a blast, literally ‚Äî it blew the airlock on my 5 gallon brewing bucket ‚Äî twice. After that everything seemed normal. Until now. I added my fining agent, waited, and noticed that nothing had changed. The wine is still very much opaque. Worse, when I tried transferring it to a secondary it foamed up again ‚Äî not a lot, but enough to get my attention. I tried de-gassing it with a wine-whip ‚Äî spent 30 minutes attempting to de-gas it but now I have a thick layer of foam at the top. At least the foam looks different now, more white instead of pink. But yeah, there‚Äôs like two inches of foam. What the heck is going on, and can my wine be saved? Thank you!",winemaking
"Peach wine stopped fermenting after 5 days, any advise? Here is a [photo](https://i.imgur.com/0RffnlL.jpg).

Hi there! I've been lurking on this sub since I started making my own wine about 3 months ago. Last week I started my new project, a peach wine, but now after five days the fermentation seems to have gotten stuck. I'm hoping anyone on here might know what went wrong or how I can try to fix it.

This is the recipe I used and the steps I followed. Last week Thursday I started with 3 kg of peaches. I mashed them up, added 1 liter water, pecto enzymes and a little snuff of sulfite (about 0.1 g). I let the mixture sit in a fermentation bucket overnight, covered by a cheesecloth. Next day I squeezed out the juice and ended up with 3 liters of peach juice. I did my measurements and found out the juice had a sugar level of 1040 (84 g per liter). I decided I wanted an alcohol level of 11% in my wine, and I wanted to make 5 liter, so calculated that I needed 5x11x18 = 990 g sugar in my wine. I already had 3 x 84 = 252 grams of sugar present from the 3 liter peach juice. I also already had 262 from the yeast starter I made that day (the yeast dissolved in white grape juice with some added sugar to get it started). So I calculated that I still needed to add 990 - (262+252) = 476 g sugar. I already had 1 liter of fluid from the yeast starter, so I heated an extra 0.75 liter water and dissolved the 476 g of sugar in the water. Once it cooled down I added 5 grams of yeast nutrient and mixed. I added the sugar water to the peach juice and mixed. Then I added the liter of yeast starter to the juice and mixed. I put it all in a demijohn bottle and sealed it with a waterlock. It started fermenting already within a couple of hours and the next morning it had gone absolutely berzerk! The wine (to be) was squirting out of the waterlock sometimes against the ceiling even! I moved the demijohn to a saver place where it wouldn't stain the ceiling and left it there. After two days of this extreme fermenting it calmed down to a normal (from what I've seen so far) level. However it kept slowing bit by bit from then on and this morning there were no more bubbles coming through the waterlock and fermentation seems to have stopped almost fully... 

I guess it's good to mention that I did clean all my equipment thoroughly with a sulfite/acid mixture and then rinsed with water after cleaning.

This is the first wine I'm making where I've done all the measurements myself in stead of relying on someone's recipe telling me how much sugar to add, so I'm kind of worried I messed up there somehow. Also I'm thinking I may have added too much yeast. I used a full package which said it would be enough for 10-20 liter wine, but I used it to make only 5 liter. However I tried googling this and found that it shouldn't be a problem most times. 

I'm really hoping anyone on here has a clue of what might've happened and how I could try to fix it. Any advise would be appreciated so much! Thank you in advance.

"DB oxidized in primary? Hey y‚Äôall I‚Äôm making this:


https://www.winemakingtalk.com/threads/dangerdaves-dragon-blood-wine.41825/

As a 5 gallon batch. Today my SG is down to 0.990 and my temp is at 73.0. I‚Äôve been consistently losing about 0.010 SG/day and the color has been gorgeous. 

Today, however, it looked ruddy and sad. Not the beautiful ruby I had been seeing. 

I‚Äôll admit yesterday I didn‚Äôt end up stirring or temp checking because I had a run in with a wild cat and ended up in the ER for rabies shots and wound care! (Whoops, but life happens).

Did it oxidize in primary? Is it ruined? How do I get that color back, if possible? I snapped down the lid five minutes ago after checking on everything but it has no airlock or cap so it‚Äôs got a big ol hole the bag is sticking up out of.",winemaking
"Should I dump it? Oaked on peg board TL;DR: wine got peg board pulp in it. Should I dump?

So I just went to filter my wine with my buon vino when I noticed something in the top of the carboy. My wife had been doing a job in my tool room / winery a 4-5 weeks back and had cut a whole in the peg board I have on the wall. Looks like some of the peg board pulp somehow ended up in the top of the carboy. She said the airlock had fallen off but she put it back on right away. Maybe, maybe not. Regardless, there was a layer of pulp in the very top of the neck of the carboy. 

I had already prepared my clean carboy and wine filter so I filtered from under the pulp. No noticeable smell. The peg board basically looks like cardboard but I am concerned about the glue that could have been in it. 

According to wikipedia peg board article, ""Standard perforated hardboard is made of wood fibers, usually with the addition of resin, and tempered by coating with a thin layer of linseed oil and baking at a high temperature to polymerize the oil"". My concern would mainly be with whatever is in the resin.",winemaking
"Flowers of wine troubleshooting I'm making peach country wine and noticed some white ""snowflake"" bits on the surface of some of the peaches at the top. Through research, I've realized these are flowers of wine. Because I'm not using anything but fruit, sugar and water to make wine ([here's the recipe](https://www.milkwood.net/2014/03/24/how-to-make-wild-fermented-young-country-wine-its-easy/)), how should I go about removing the flora? Do I need to remove it?

Here's the process I used for this wine:

1. Sanitized the container and utensils with white vinegar and warm water
2. Dissolved sugar into warm water and poured into gallon sized wide mouth mason jar
3. Topped with sliced fruit
4. Covered jar with cheesecloth for 2 days (until bubbles were actively forming). Agitated jar \~3x/day to prevent fruit at the top from drying out
5. Replaced cheesecloth with airlock lid on day 3. Still agitated 3x/day
6. Plan to bottle when desired dryness is achieved

After day 4, I noticed white specks on the top fruit.

Thank you!",winemaking

"Calculating ABV when adding sugar and water Hi all,

I know this topic has been touched here before but most posts what I found were talking about adding sugar but not water.

So I started making wine from fruits/berries from a recipe which tells me to add 2kg of sugar to berries, top it off with water until 25L, pitch the yeast and let it ferment for 5 days.

Then rack the wine from the solids and add more sugar and water. Amount of sugar here depends on the specific recipes for specific berries/fruit, anywhere from 2 to 4kg.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I did with my strawberry wine, was I added 4kg of sugar to \~10kg of berries and topped it off with water. OG was 1.110. So now I've let it ferment for more than 5 days, it's still bubbling strong, and yesterday the SG was 1.007 which makes about 13.5%. It tasted still very sweet and quite strong, almost like a strawberry liqueur. 

So now I'm planning to rack the wine off the berries, but then I need to add more water to get back to 25L and I probably need to add more sugar so it wouldn't be diluted very much. 

But how could I calculate how much sugar I need? If I dilute it with water, the SG goes down right, but not past 1.000. So if I add sugar and it goes over 1.007 again, does that mean that my ABV will rise over 13.5%? I actually thought about targeting 11.5% so is this viable still? May it mean that I only have to add water and no sugar, depending on the amount of wine I'm left after racking?

&amp;#x200B;

And also, another way around, I am also planning on pitching yeast to my rhubarb wine today (I cut up 7kg of rhubarb, added 4kg of sugar, topped it off with water to 25L (\~6.5 gal) and added potassium carbonate to neutralise the oxalic acid and added potassium metabisulfite to kill the wild yeast and bacteria). But the OG was only 1.057, which would result in 7.5%-8.8% depending on which dryness I want. But I want this to also end up near 11.5%, so I thought about also adding sugar after \~1-2 weeks of fermentation and racking. But the problem is the same, how much sugar?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I measure the SG before racking, then rack and add the water and then measure the SG again? But I don't know what to do with that then. I do know that \~16-20g of sugar per 1 litre will add about 1% of ABV but I don't know how much water dilutes it. 

&amp;#x200B;

One way I thought how to do this was to add water to plain fruit, measure OG and then calculate how much sugar I need in total.. but that probably doesn't help because the amount of water I need to reach 25L is different if I need to add 3kg of sugar or 6kg of sugar. So 5L water on berries gives a different result than 10L water on berries. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I don't know what's the best way to plan for this and eventually calculate it.",winemaking

"Question about sugar. Normally when I make a batch, I will use table sugar to bump my starting specific gravity. However last semester I learned that yeast can really only eat glucose efficiently and has a hard time eating fructose. This would explain some issues with over sweetness in past batches since table sugar(sucrose) is glucose and fructose bonded together. So I'm curious what would be the best solution for this. Should I just source my sugar strictly from the fruit, is there pure glucose options, and/or should I do what beer makers do and break down starches (barley, oat, ect) with amylase via sprouting? Additionally, what are some methods that you all employ to raise your specific gravity?",winemaking

Room will be open by 4:45 pm pdt this Friday if you want to jump in early.

Please accept my invitation to a non-commercial presentation of a pre-harvest check-in and Q&amp;A with two veteran winemakers with more than 60 harvests between them.

Here's some questions I plan to pose to David, and if you have others, please post them in comments:

Welcome, David! Let‚Äôs put something in our glass and have a chat! 

The focus of this show will be mostly Q&amp;A for beginning and small production winemakers, but first let‚Äôs understand your history. Give us a bit of background on your journey into wine.

First question that came in: How important is it for a home winemaker to plant, grow and harvest their own grapes?

Commercial Vineyards are an amazing source of value fruit right now, fruit has never been cheaper. When you go into a vineyard to check vines and fruit, what‚Äôs your protocol from when you get out of your car until you leave the vineyard? Take notes? Photos? Testing?

If you were talking to your vineyard manager, where you purchase fruit, and are describing picking, sorting and delivery protocol, what would you request/demand.

What has your experience taught you about pulling the trigger on a vineyard for harvest.

You‚Äôre making 1000 lb lot of Pinot Noir from Sierra Madre Vineyard in Santa Maria‚Äîlooking to get a barrel and some topping wine. The fruit comes in on a warm day, fruit temp is 85 degrees, and otherwise pretty sound with a small amount of bird damage, less than 2%. Pop quiz hotshot‚Ä¶..take us through how you make this wine, and for fun, let‚Äôs assume you only have advanced home winemaking equipment.

How should a small production winemaker keep their barrels, carboys and other containers of aging wine safe and sound? 

What‚Äôs the best way for a home winemaker to finish, test, stabilize and bottle?",winemaking

So the question: I prepared the must a week ago (peaches in a cheesecloth bag, all ingredients added except yeast, and 1 campden tablet. Measured the SG and it was 1.100. 24 hours for the campden to dissipate, then added the yeast. Within a day it was fermenting rapidly, went for a couple of days, and then seemed to stop. I planned to let it go for 2 weeks in primary, but since I didn‚Äôt see any activity I though fermentation must have stopped and would need to be restarted, but I checked the SG and it measured at 0.994. Total fermentation time was about 5 days to reach that point, which shocked me based on every kit I‚Äôve ever done. Does this seem normal/acceptable?

I‚Äôve passed the point of pouring my wine through a cheese cloth and discarded the fruit. My wine is now in another container with an one way valve on the top, but I‚Äôm not seeing any bubbles like I‚Äôm expecting. 

My method has been to add about 5 punnets of cherries, sugar and boiling water. Waited for it to cool and added pectolace followed by campden tablets a few hours later. After a couple of days I added my yeast and yeast nutrient. Then let that sit for a week, then stained out the fruit and sealed it up. Everything I‚Äôve read says I should be seeing it bubble away, but I‚Äôm not doing. My initial gravity reading was 1.100, but I‚Äôve not done any more since.

My only thought, other than doing something wrong, is that there‚Äôs only a small amount of wine in quite a large container. So I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm not seeing anything because of the massive air space maybe?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any help or ideas, thank you!",winemaking

"False Bottom(ish) for Marchisio 200 L Variable Capacity Tank Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone would have a suggestion for something similar to a false bottom for a Marchisio 200 L variable fermenter. I planned on putting my grapes in the fermenter and allowing them to ferment on the skins initially. My hope was to then allow free flowing fermented juice to come out the spigot at the bottom with the hope of it being fairly clean. Then I could press the rest. I typically just ferment in a large plastic barrel, strain out the juice, and then press the skins for more. 

I thought about posting in the Homebrewing  sub for this, but since it‚Äôs technically a wine fermenter and it will be for wine I figured I‚Äôd throw my question here. 

Thanks in advance!",winemaking

In my state, there isn't anything similar to this to my knowledge, and I wanted to poll the good honest people of r/winemaking to see if there is a desire to see winemakers in their element talking about what makes us tick.

"Skeeter Pee fermentation time question My skeeter pee has been actively bubbling for 8 weeks now. It took off pretty quick, then slowed down to a crawl after week two - but for the last six weeks or so it's been putting up some bubbles. Not much, but I get that I have to dry it out before it's done. 

All my other wines and hooches were done after 3-4 weeks. Is it normal for skeeter pee to take twice as long to finish? Why is it still going? Does anyone have experience with this taking longer? Thanks!",winemaking
"Wine tasting a bit acidic Hi! I have a question. I have tried to make wine twice and both times the wine has tasted a bit acidic, almost vinegar. The first time I understand it because I tried to do it without the minimum equipment required. but this second time I did it in a much more controlled environment. The process was as follows: I crushed the grapes by hand, I left them for a week with the must and stirred it twice daily. Then, filtered and put in a carboy with a balloon as an airlock (bought a real one airlock but it's on transit). It started to ferment and make some bubbles, that's how it was for one more week (I didn't make that much wine, a liter) and yesterday I saw that it no longer bubbled, so I decided to transfer it to a bottle but not before drinking a little to taste it and it has an acid taste. What I can be doing wrong? Thanks for all your comments and suggestions!",winemaking
"Learned a really cool trick this weekend... Three weeks ago, when my buddy and me moved our blueberry wine out of primary fermentation into secondary, we wound up with an ""extra"" gallon that didn't fit into our 5 gallon carboy.  

We racked off the extra gallon into a single gallon jug and decided to ""experiment"".  Turns out my buddy had some lightly toasted oak cubes and a vanilla bean left over from a previous project.  

Fast forward two weeks (last weekend), when we went to bottle the wine, we tested the ""control"" (5 gallon) and compared it to the ""experiment"" (1 gallon)--night and day difference!  The change was so drastic we decided to alter the 5 gallons to the same flavor of the one gallon jug.  

While it might have set us back bottling by two-three weeks, I am ALWAYS going to pull off a gallon in the future to experiment with ""tweaks"" to the flavor!",winemaking

"ABV higher than yeast tolerance? Hello fermenting friends. I was just racking my first wine for the first time from primary into secondary (although I think fermentation is pretty much done). I measured my original SG to be 1.119 and my SG now is 0.998. That calculates to 15.88% which is fine with me, but the Montrachet yeast says it has a tolerance of only 13%. I'm just wondering if this is normal and if I should add a Campden Tab to my wine (1 gallon). For reference it is a cherry-blueberry wine and it has been 12 days since inoculation. Thanks in advance for the help!

Edit: I want to add that I am not a stranger to using chemistry equipment, so I'm pretty confident I didn't misread the hydrometer, but it's possible. Mostly wondering if its possible for a wild yeast to take it that high or if the packaged yeasts can ever exceed their tolerance",winemaking

"Oh boy... I may have gone and f@&amp;$%d up. Long story short, I may have ruined my first attempt at making wine this afternoon. I was transferring out of primary, into a 5 gal carboy for secondary. Everything went smooth, more or less. Until it came time to stopper it up. The bung wouldn't stay in the mouth, with or without the airlock in it. No matter what, it just kept sliding up and breaking the seal. I tried maybe a little too hard once without the airlock in, and, well..... the bung sorta pushed through the mouth and fell down in. Like, all the way in. 

Obviously I've bought the wrong bungs. I did, fortunately by two of them. I've temporarily duct taped (Merikuh!) the second bung in place and installed the airlock. I'm fairly sure every surface of the bung was sterile, as my hands were still sterile.

My questions are:

1. Will this ruin the wine if the bung is left in? Its black raspberry, and nearly finished fermenting, so it will only be there for a few days (hopefully)

And

2. How the hell do I even go about retrieving the damned thing? Empty or full, I'm struggling to think of a way to get it out.

"Orange cranberry wine got a fly in side the fermenter. I made 2 gallons of 14% abv Orange cranberry wine using store bought juices. (Grape juice, orange juice, and cranberry juice). It took about 2 and a half weeks to finish fermenting.

 I decided to rack the product from the 2 gallon fermentation bucket over to 1 gallon carboy today. 

But unfortunately I've had an terrible fly issue in the house lately and haven't been able to get rid of all of them yet. So when I check my airlock after fermentation is over I see there are quite a few flies in there.

I got worried so I changed out the airlock and opened the bucket to make sure no flies got into the wine and at the time I didn't see any. It smelled pretty normal (like a young wine should, slightly fruity with sharp young wine smells and a strong sent of alcohol).

After I finished racking the wine I was left with about 1 and a half gallons. Unfortunately I saw 1 fly in the carboy that somehow managed to get in and i have no idea if it was during fermentation or while racking earlier today. 

So I followed by tasting the wine to make sure it was ok and it tasted pretty normal. (I've made this wine before).

But just to be sure I added a campden tablet to the carboys and started seconday fermentation as normal.

Do you think the wine will be ok? I really dont want this to start turning into vinegar or something.

"Wine from this kit leaves my throat feeling harsh and gives me terrible hangovers. Why? This is only my second wine kit - the first one turned out really good! - and I‚Äôve been brewing beer for a few years now and have never encountered something like this. 

This one has problems. First off every time I drink any of the wine I seem to get a headache/hangover. It could be as little as one glass but it always happens. Secondly if I do drink a few glasses of it I find my throat is somewhat raw the next day, like I‚Äôve had bad indigestion. What gives? What could have possibly caused this to happen?

"Fruit Wine Questions So, after working with meads and an experiment with coffee wine, I started to try my hand with fruit wines today ‚Äì and realized I don‚Äôt really know my stuff. I prepped two gallons tonight, one with 4lbs (U.S.) of black cherries and the other with about 4lbs of blueberries. I mashed each batch of fruit (and pitted the cherries) to get the juices and pulp, added a bit of water to get to about 3 quarts (that meant adding maybe one quart to each), and then added syrup to bring the gravity of each to 1.090.

For the first (possible) issue, the blueberry must wound up fairly viscous; there‚Äôs definitely liquid juice, but there‚Äôs also a decent amount of pulp and the liquid itself seems almost syrupy. Is this normal for blueberry must, or did I use too much fruit for a one-gallon batch?

Then, for both wines, I put the musts into glass carboys which were all I had on hand, along with the pulp and skins. Should I be expecting any issues to result from this other than that the carboys will be difficult to clean out? At the moment there‚Äôs fruit in each in contact with the surface which I figured would settle to the bottom, but if it doesn‚Äôt then would this be at risk for developing mold or infections? It also occurred to me that part of the space within the carboys is taken up by solids that obviously won‚Äôt get into the final bottles, and lo and behold at least one source online told me to use primary fermenters slightly larger than my intended batch size to account for that; should I be expecting a significant difference, would it be worth it to buy 2-gallon buckets and transfer the contents from the carboys into those, or is this a trivial issue?

And finally, if you have any advice for a hapless vintner feel free to leave it. I went into this particular project fairly confidently and have left it feeling like I know less than when I started.",winemaking

"Ingredients order question Hello.

I was gifted one of those DIY brew-in-abag wine boxes from a friend.  The instructions seem fairly straight forward, nevertheless I still managed to make an error.  After 11 days of fermentation it said to do the following:

1) Add the packet of Sulfate/Sorbate, tighten the cap, shake the bag, loosen the cap to let the air escape, repeat 5 times.

2) Add the packet of Kieselsol.  Tighten the cap, shake it, loosen the cap.  Wait one hour.  

3) Add the packet of Chitosan, tighten the cap, shake, loosen cap.  Re-tighten cap and leave undisturbed for 5 days.

Well, I went and added the Chitosan first before the other 2 steps.  So I decided to just throw all of the other packs in ( sulfate and kieselsol) and did the 5-times shake/losen routine.

Will this turn out fine or was that hour long rest supposed to do something mega-important? 

Also, I make beer from grain regularly in which fermentation temperatures are quite important. Is there an ideal temperature range for fermenting red wine?  The instructions on this didn‚Äôt indicate, but I have another box if this to do later.

"How critical is full sanitization of equipment in winemaking? Coming from the world of beermaking, sanitizing equipment and sterilizing the wort is of paramount importance, and everything needs to be maintained sterile, and the only microbiology should be the one you deliberately add yourself as the fermentation agent.

Going to winemaking however, I feel for me it all gets a little blurry. Sure you should keep the equipment clean, but you are still adding a bunch of fruits/berries containing the natural microbial flora(/fauna?) and mashing them up and then keeping them at bay with the proper concentration of sulfites, therefore focusing activity on the added yeast. With that in mind, do you really need to use foodgrade sanitizers on everything, or is it enough to quickly clean the equipment? I'm thinking that if the sulfite concentration can prevent an infection from the fruits/berries, it should then be pretty good too at preventing an infection from a cleaned but not sterilized spatula for instance.

"Screwed up my wine During primary fermentation, can I save it? Hi, I‚Äôm new to wine making and today I realized I messed up.

I was making rhubarb wine. 

I did not put enough water in my wine. My initial gravity was 1.130(which I thought was odd) 

the initial water I put in was only 8 pints, as I didn‚Äôt add the extra water up to the five gallon mark as the recipe didn‚Äôt state that.

Before adding the water the gravity was about 1.010. After the dilution it‚Äôs now 1.005.

"Woods for aging Hi all,

I have unlimited free access to silver maple, hard maple, red oak, poplar, live oak, and cedar. I have very little access to white oak...the one most frequently use when aging wine and spirits. 

Can you share resources, experiences, and thoughts on the use of these alternative woods in wine aging? I believe cedar to be both too aromatic and slightly toxic, but what about the maples and the red oak? Poplar? Live oak?

If no one has experimented with these...something I find a little hard to believe, then I can do experiments and post here about it. But if would be great if someone has an article or blog post about doing the experiment and could share it. 

I suspect live oak has way way way too much tannin for aging wine. I wonder if the same is true for the red oak. I think poplar and hard maple might be too low in tannin and sugar and that poplar will have a tendency to disintegrate in the wine. Silver maple probably has a poor flavor profile, low sugar, low tannin, and also disintegrates. 

Please share whatever thoughts and resources.

That said I've never had a home made wine.  And frankly I have had some fruit wines from a local orchard which really did not float my boat.    I would hate to launch myself into this and not appreciate the end product.

How can I sample some home made wines that I could reasonably expect to recreate myself?  Both grapes and other fruit wines that a beginner could master with some effort.  I'd like to know that the rewards of my next adventure will be worth the time and money.

Any suggestions?

Thx, Jay",winemaking

Next weekend, my partner and I were scheduled to start some large scale Mead production.  We have our recipe (a variation of JAOM) where we like it, and have done small batch experiments.  We now want to scale up, and make two 6 gallon sets.  And have acquired 5 gallons of Honey for this purpose.

The problem that I had not counted on was that 5 gallons of Honey ways about 60 pounds.  It is going to be difficult to get precision weight measurements when we can not even lift the damn bucket for a pour.  So.... thoughts?

"Dandelion Wine questions - flavor before secondary/bottling I've done beer in the past, not much for wine.  I'm trying a dandelion wine and a lilac wine right now.

-Dandelion Wine:

OG: 1.116 (I did a bad job of temp correcting, I thought it was 1.1 originally)

Gravity where it seems finished, 3 weeks in: 1.01

-Lilac wine:

OG: 1.096

Gravity now, 2 weeks in: 1.01 also.  Still fermenting more.

Lalvin 1116 yeast in both (I'm recalling that off the top of my head... It's that really common one people like)

---

So the dandelion wine is still a bit sweet.  I think I got up towards the max alcohol of this yeast.  It's in a secondary now, I hear I should leave it there for 2-3 months before bottling.  That sweetness seems good and fine to me, I don't mind that.  

But I'm wondering - how ""good"" should dandelion wine taste at this stage?  I'm tasting the bit from the hydrometer tube, and while there's a good aspect to it I also sense some sour, some kind of vapory aspect.  How do I know if I've kept it sanitized properly?  

And honestly, I used a ton of petals but I can't say I taste a lot of difference between the dandelion and lilac wines.  I don't feel super confident I've created flavor beyond the raisins and bit of citrus.

So you'd want your storage container to be a similar material, obviously.  But what about the hose leading to the spray nozzle?  Usually that's a much different plastic.  And the sprayer nozzle itself maybe.

"Seeking technical and prescriptive books/articles on the roles and use of tannins, sorbates, and other additives. I have been making homemade wine from kits for a long time &gt;10 years. Sometimes I make wine from fruit concentrates too, but I have never made a true ""from scratch"" wine. I have always been intimidated by things like Ph, tannins, additives, sulfites, sorbates and the like. I usually just do what the kit says and roll with it. 

That said, I really want to get comfortable with experimenting and making some from-scratch wine, but most of the guides I have found so far just say ""add this much of this thing"" with no explanation beyond ""it brings out more blah blah flavors"". I want to understand what is actually happening with the different yeasts, the effect of PH, how long metabisulfites last/persist in the wine, how sorbate works and how important is it really, and what are tannins actually doing to create flavor. In short, I want not just a recipe but an understanding of the chemical and physical changes that each step makes to create flavors.

My guess is I need a book, or a collection of books. I would rather not seek a Ph.D in chemistry to learn this stuff. I also guess that ""Winemaking for Dummies"" isn't the best go-to source of technical and prescriptive information. 

What have you read that was technical in nature but also accessible enough to drive decision making when creating homemade wines? Academic articles would be great if there is such a thing for winemaking. Well-respected books are, of course, appreciated.

Thanks all

FYI, I have family members who claim to react poorly to both sulfites and sorbates, so how necessary they are and what they do (in detail) is important to me. I take great steps to avoid their use. So far I avoid them by fortifying wine by 2-3% before bottling with high-proof white spirits but an alternate method would be nice so I am not always making 14-18% wine.

I'm thinking that maybe I should go with 3.4 pH since it's a sweeter wine? I'm using the KV1-V1116 yeast strain that is more sturdy in harsher environments so hopefully it will practically work.

Botched Siphoning? So I have been brewing this sparkling ginger wine and I decided it was time to bottle. It was 6 liters in a 25 liter fermenter. (maybe that has to do with my problem). I was going to transfer it to my bottling bucket. I wrapped a cheesecloth on the receiving end of the racking cane then pumped away. Anything was barely coming out the other end so I removed the cloth and nothing changed so I had to just pour the whole thing over a mesh to catch the ingredients. Now I have a bucket with a faucet filled with yeasty ginger wine. There was so much splashing I think theres enough oxygen in that wine to fill a scuba tank. Am I fucked?

"Old Muscadine Grapevine Just Trimmed by Landscaping Crew - Is there anything I should do? [Texas] tl;dr I inherited a neglected wild grape vine that grew into/through my back fence (chainlink).

Is there anything I should do to help the chances of it surviving the Texas summer? Is it doomed regardless? Will it survive regardless?

Story:

Recently purchased a house in the fall of last year and it turns out that all the dead vines on the back fence are Muscadine grapes! I got really excited to try to tame it at the end of the season and to try to make wine for the first time. I have no pretensions about the wine probably turning out bad, but I was excited just to try.

Fast forward to a few months ago, the forest behind my house gets demolished to make way for a neighborhood. Fast forward to today, the sound of chainsaws startles me out of my bed, and I run out just in time to save all the half-ripe grapes from the other side of the fence and beg the crew not to cut through anything that looks especially thick.

I found an 11L carboid vessel that I'll use for bulk aging (so each batch will yield around 14 bottles of wine), so then maybe a 20L fermentation bucket should be enough?

Then, if I need a 20L bucket for the fermentation, will then a 30L bucket do for mashing and maceration?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I recently got into making homemade wine and have currently made 15 gallons of wine.  We absolutely love it!  There is one issue though.  We are finding that after 4 weeks we are happy with the turn out of the wine's sweetness and flavor, however, we are still making alcohol.  I am not sure the alcohol content due to never using a hydrometer, however, I do know it is much more potent than what we normally purchase at the store (11%).  I am not shooting to make a 20 percent wine, I am completely fine with it after one month and we have repeated this process 3 times now with all great results.  After one month the wine is still making alcohol and I have no idea how to stop this.  I am currently trying the chill method and then racking the wine without pulling up the yeast from the bottom, however, I am concerned that I may still pull some residual out and the wine will continue to produce alcohol.  So far from the research that I have done the only true way to ensure that no more alcohol will be made would be to remove the yeast.

"First time making berry wine - how do I make it round and smooth? Me and my dad are going to make some sweet wine with fruits and berries from the garden. He's a seasoned home-winemaker and have made plentiful of sweet berry wines. They're very good and flavourful, though I've always found them a little unpleasant too since they never turn out very round and smooth, and I often get a headache from them (sometimes even an unexpected hangover). For me this is my first time. I have experience in brewing other drinks like Kvass and Tepache, but no experience in winemaking - so my plan is to make good use of my dad's knowledge, but I also turn to you people to hopefully learn something from here so I can make some wines that are also smooth.

One wine will be 90% gooseberry, 10% plum (for extra depth), and spiced with elderflowers. Another one will be 100% blackcurrant. I have no problem in waiting for the wines to age, wether it being a few months in a vessel and/or a few years in the bottle. So far my method to make it a tad smoother is to aim for a slightly lower ABV (12% instead of 13.5-14%) and also pay close attention to what gravity tastes the best when sweetening the wine before bottling, and then age first for a few months in a fermentation bucket, and then in the bottle for maybe 2-3 years.

"Questions about clarifying, timing, and bentonite First the important stuff:

5-Gallon batch

Vintner's Best Black Currant Base

Lalvin 1118

SG 1.090

Yeast pitched June 3rd.

&amp;#x200B;

I have used bentonite to clarify wine in the past but only after completion of both primary and secondary fermentation...about 2 weeks of each. I add the bentonite when I rack the 3rd time for aging and by the time I bottle it is clear...even polished. I have always been happy with the bentonite's performance but now I want to try something different and get your input.

Here is my proposed (new) timeline:

June 3rd, pitch yeast

June 17th, rack to secondary and add bentonite

July 1st, rack off sediment

July 8th, drink! Woo!

I don't want to bother aging this fruit wine. I didn't add oak or anything and this is a first foray into fruit wines for me...everything else has been grapes or honey. My main concern is whether the 2-weeks between rack to secondary and rack off sediment is enough time for the bentonite to do its thing. Like I said, usually I would wait until I rack the wine the 3rd time to add bentonite and more or less forget about it for a couple months. What do you think?

I know some people add bentonite at the start of primary fermentation but I have never tried it, does this method for clarifying work OK? In case you ware wondering about isinglass or gelatin, there are people in my family with dietary restrictions so I don't use those.

Thanks for your input, I really appreciate it.

An hour later I poured another glass and the taste seemed completely different. There was a slightly harsh almost alkaline, slightly bitter taste at the finish that wasn't there in the first glass. It poured clear and there was barely any perceptible sediment stirred up in the bottle after the first glass. 

What might cause this difference between the first and second glass? Does the sediment have a flavor and will even trace amounts be noticeable? I added sulfites before bottling but the solution was completely diluted before mixing so I wouldn't expect the sediment to contain any solid bits of that. The sediment appears to be yeast and a marginal amount of fining sediment.

2. Transfer to secondary 5 gallon jug before it's completely finished so it can build a layer of carbon dioxide in the jug and push out most of the oxygen.
3. Start the other 2.5 gallons or so with the other half of the sugar on the same fruit and then add that do the first half when its done.

**tl;dr -** Can I do 2.5 gallons on fruit, move it to a jug, do another 2.5 gallons on the same fruit and combine into the same jug to get a total of 5 gallons?",winemaking

"Winery Mold Control Good Evening Everyone,

I was wondering if anyone had any advice or techniques in regards to mold control inside a winery? At every winery I have worked at there has always been that issue of black mold growth on tanks, walls, and floors. While I have used some different techniques to clean and remove mold, I have yet to find a very helpful solution.

I was wondering if there was some sort of spray on foam that could be utilized, it would sit and break down the mold and then a rinse would take everything off. Does anyone have any ideas?

I have been using a clean skin solution but find it still requires a ton of scrubbing. Someone recommended trying an acid solution but I am unsure if that would be safe to spray on.

"Fruit floating above wine? I am making 5 gallons of mixed berry dessert wine (mostly strawberry with blueberry, raspberry and blackberry) pitched on 5/19. It is so sweet i am letting it go in primary for a while (but i did forget about it and probably should have put it in secondary by now). The berries were mashed with a potato masher and have risen up into a thick cake above the liquid. It looks ok (no apparent mold/bacterial growth) but I'm concerned about this batch. Last year I used essentially the same recipe but with only pureed strawberries. Last year, it fermented vigorously in primary for 2 to 3 weeks and for about a month at least in secondary). This year, it seems to be fermenting slowly but perhaps I just can't hear the vigorous bubbling below the fruit layer on top. What do you think I should do? If the specific gravity is similar to the original sg (1.058 i think) should I repitch and keep in primary?

Also, i had 15 lbs of frozen pureed peaches and am making dessert wine out of that too. The start sg rated off the scale (1.062 i think) to result in a very sweet wine (very similar to my strawberry wine last year) and it is fermenting just like the pureed strawberry must from last year.

"Need help figuring out if I did anything wrong with peach wine 	I recently racked my peach wine I have had from primary to secondary and tried a taste of it. To me, it tastes off in a way I can't quite put my finger on  (though I'm not sure what a peach wine is supposed to taste like). It definitely tastes like it has alcohol in it, kind of peachy I guess but it doesn't taste like wine. My girlfriend says its kind of like a cider and my brother says it tastes like yeast and peaches. It's smelled real good this whole time and fermented fine so I really suprised how peculiar it tastes. Anyway, here's my recipe if any of you can find anything that would be wrong. This is my third time fermenting and my first time with using fruit pulp.
- 5 lbs of peaches (4 lbs after pairing)
- 28 cups water
 - 4 lbs of sugar (+added 2 cups to get must to 1.1 specific grav)
- boiled dead baking yeast (for yeast nutrient)
- 1.5 tbsp of lemon juice
- 1 pack Lavlin ICV-D47 yeast
Making must:
	clean and pare away pits and bruises from peaches. Mash peaches in a bowl. dissolve sugar in water and add the lemon juice and peach mash (pulp tied up in a cheese cloth). Place the mixture the basement to covered in a brew bucket overnight. Next evening, prepare the D47 yeast and boil a pack of baking yeast for 15 minutes. Add both to the mixture and stir well. Add in sugar in quarter cups until must is at 1.1 specific gravity (~13% potential) (ended up being 2 cups). 
Primary fermentation:
	Stir the must once a day for 5 or so minutes. sits at about 65-66oF. Sits in a modified 5 gallon water jug (cut the top off so its more of a bucket now) and is covered with a cheese cloth. Let it sit in primary until 1.02 specific grav (took about 9 days or so). 
Remarks:
	The must seemed to ferment just fine. It didn't seem too weak or too aggressive. Bubbling was really steady. It started to bubble the next day just like my other wines with D47 have done. I was scared that I added too much sugar initially, but the yeast seemed to be pretty happy the whole time and didn't act sluggish. before racking day, I measured 1.021 sp.gr. I waited until the next day where its about 1.011 sp.gr. This is my first time brewing by sp. gr. so I don't know if I let that get too low or not. Currently the wine is sitting in my secondary fermentation bottles and are happily and steadily bubbling away. Oh and any tips on how to easily separate the must from the pulp when you rack would be appreciated. That was a bear. 
	Any help anyone can offer would be much appreciated. I think winemaking is really satisfying and I'm always proud to drink and show off the wines I make to people.",winemaking

"Is a Secondary fermentation vessel needed when using concentrates? Hey all! 
I‚Äôm currently on the 2 week mark of my first ever winemaking journey. For 5 gallons, I used some LD Carlson Blackberry concentrate off of Amazon with 4 gallons of water and, of course, a packet of yeast + nutrients. It has been sitting for two weeks now - I have not stirred or otherwise touched it at all. I am following a guide that I had on this little pamphlet from the home brew store. Today, I opened up the bucket to check out the must and there is no foam on top or anything like people sometimes say there is. Maybe this is bc I used concentrate? Nonetheless, it smells like alcohol.

My main question is whether or not I absolutely need to switch to a secondary fermentation vessel, despite the fact that I didn‚Äôt use fruit (thus, there should be no sediment at the bottom). The pamphlet said I should at the two week mark.

I‚Äôm honestly kind of lost as to what to do, but I have made mead before and this seems pretty straight forward. Any other advice is very much appreciated, though!

"Questions from a new winemaker I started a Cru Select Cab Sauv kit during quarantine. Everything went great with the fermentation and I am aging in a 6g glass carboy. It tastes pretty good. The issue is that the wine has a yeast-like aroma. Is this normal for a wine this young? Will the yeast aroma disappear on its own?

I have been racking it about once every two weeks in the hopes that removing the wine off of the film (lees?) at the bottom will lessen the yeast smell. Is this the right approach? Is that too often for racking?

Should I try that aeration racking (sorry, I don‚Äôt remember the proper name) to remove the smell? That seems counterintuitive to everything else I have read about preventing aeration as much as possible while racking.

How long should I age in the carboy before bottling? The instructions in the kit say to bottle right away, but just about everyone here and in other sources say to age for 6 months or more.

"Pineapple beer (wine?) Hello everybody!

I know the title consists of the word ""beer"" but I believe this fermentation process is something wine makers could relate better with.

Due to COVID-19, the sales of alcohol have been banned in South Africa. Therefore people are purchasing bakers yeast and pineapple to make there own.
 https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-to-make-your-own-homebrew-2020-4

This is being labeled as a beer, however I think the process may be more similiar to wine.

Regardless, I am not posting for an intense debate of what its classified as, but I am curious about the safety relating to the fermentation of fruits. I figured who better to ask than wine makers?

With everyone's experience in the fermentation of fruits, at what point should I be concerned with botulism and methanol? What other hazards should I be concerned with.

My fermentation process consisted of the following.

10 cups of boiled water
2.5 cups of granulated sugar
1 cup of raisins from box
2 tsp of dry active yeast
1 cleaned, chopped up pineapple with skin on (removed leaves)

Added sugar, pineapple, raisins to food grade container, poured hot water over them and stirred. Added the yeast after hot water has cooked.

I covered the container with a lid, similar to a Tupper ware lid. It was not completely air tight, however the pressure from gas was enough to keep the lid ""puffed up"", but not enough to pop off the container.

I sterilized all my equipment in each step. 

I have let the mixture ferment for 3 days. I would like to place them in glass containers to drink them but I have never fermented fruit like this before. I have experience in beer making but would like to hear from people who ferment fruits.

"What determines when grapes will appear? Hello r/winemaking. I've observed something quite odd and thought I'd ask about it. Maybe even upload a picture for reference.

I planted a Canadice grape to the east side of my garden last year because a groundhog dug up my Pinot Gris the year before which killed it. There was decent growth in the year I planted it. In the same year I planted a Concord grape which had about the same growth.

 At the same time I planted the Pinot Gris I planted a Flame Seedless on the west side of my garden which grew really well but seems to not do too well when it comes to winter injury (a lot of the buds didn't sprout this year or last year. 

I know table grapes aren't ideal for making wine but I thought that this year I'd have more than what I wanted to eat so I thought I'd give it a try. However, once again, the Flame Seedless is struggling with only the first two buds sprouting and one at the top (I'm using the kniffin system). The Canadice grapes sprouted faster but are showing two clusters of grapes. This isn't the first time I've had a cluster of grapes in the year after I've planted a grape; the same thing happened last year with my Niagara grapes which I decided to keep because I've never tried them before.

My question, therefore, is what determines whether or not grapes will form on the vine? I'm wondering because there is a small chance that the Flame Seedless might not show any but for the second year in a row a smaller grape has. I've been interested in this for a while and I'm hoping to figure it out before next year where I'll hopefully get Concord grapes to make a sweet wine.",winemaking
"Length of initial fermentation I am currently fermenting my second batch of wine. I made it from  Ocean Spray 100% Cran-Raspberry juice. I added enough sugar to get an initial gravity reading of about 1.113. I used Red Star Premiere Rouge yeast. The next day nothing was happening so I added a little bit more of the yeast and about 3 ounces of raisins. 
It kicked off a few hours later. About a week and a half passed and I took out the raisins since they looked a bit off, and topped off the jar with more of the juice. It has been 2 weeks and my fermentation is still going strong. Is this normal for a primary fermentation? Temperatures in my house have been up and down with the weather and humidity.",winemaking

"How are you supposed to rack off of raisins? When I racked my dandelion wine out of the primary fermenter and into a new demijohn, I did it over 15oz of golden raisins. Today, one month later, I racked into a third demijohn where I was intending to age it for three more months before bottling.

Before I racked it today, all of the raisins had settled to the bottom and the wine was a beautiful clear amber color. Unfortunately when I racked it, the raisins began to clog my autosiphon.

I had to leave all of the wine below the level of the raisins in the old demijohn, so my new jug is only about halfway full. There are also some small raisin bits and some dead yeast that made their way into the new jug, and the liquid is once again cloudy and unappealing to look at.

I'm incredibly frustrated. Although I did end up straining what was left in the old jug through some cheesecloth, and it tastes pretty good (I'm assuming it's safe to drink?).

Any tips for next time? Is it a problem that there's so much empty space in my jug? This project has been months in the making and still has months to go, I would be gutted if it went south after so much time and effort has been put into it.",winemaking

"Thinking of purchasing a venue for Events, however it sits on 11 acres and has a vineyard. Need some advice. More in comments Hello!

Like the title says; I‚Äôve been in the event industry all my life and feel extremely confident in running an Event Venue. However the property I am looking to purchase has a vineyard that is fully capable of producing wine and potentially making this Venue a Winery as well. I believe this will add to the appeal of the Venue, therefore a potentially strong asset to consider.

My main concern; is it going to be a big project or big expense to get someone to manage the winemaking? Should I consider learning as much as I can to limit the payroll on the Winemaking? 

Thanks for all and any advice.


Here‚Äôs some info on the Vineyard:


The vineyard was designed by Stan Grant with Progressive Viticulture, the premier vineyard consultant. Grapes are Petite Syrah, are approximately six years old and is a Wye Trellis System. The irrigation system was designed and installed by Precision Irrigation w/ new pump and filtration system located next to the canal that feeds Irrigation water to the grapes.",winemaking
"How to preserve wine made two years ago? Hello, firstly apologies if any of my questions sound either stupid or make no sense but here goes. 
Today i managed to get a bottle of my nonnos (grandads) which he used to make himself. 

Im not a drinker myself so dont really know much about wine at all except something like ot gets better with age?? 

Anyway. I managed to get this bottle. Which is at least two years old, as he passed away two years ago this week. 

I was wondering if there was anything i could do to it to somehow improve it in anyway?

Again i dont really know what im talking about so apologies if it just makes no sense at all. 

His wine was well known for being extremely strong and some say may have had a few bits floating around in it. 

Would filtering it out or changing bottles make any difference at all? 

Also its a red wine if that helps at all.

Take care.

"how to marble well? TL;DR - what are the tricks to using marbles to prevent oxidation?  what are the hurdles, and how have you overcome them?

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen lots of advice on using clean glass beads or marbles to help raise the surface in a carboy and limit air exposure, but I have a few questions for those who have experience with this method.

How do you deal with sediment?  I am not sure how sedimentation would react in the clearing stages here.  does it filter down between the marbles, or does it layer up on top?  When racking, is it difficult to get a good clean rack with the bumpy surface?  and if i tilt the carboy to get the last bits of clear wine, is there a risk of shifting marbles stirring up sediment?  If so, what are some tricks to limit this?

Do you find a lot of wine loss due to good wine being down between the marbles?  If so, how much?  is it enough to be concerned about, like losing a whole bottle out of the batch?  I imagine if this is a problem, it adds up over rackings, right?  maybe not?

"Stuck fermentation. **tldr;** for an experimental dandelion wine stuck half way, is it worth the effort to kick start, or should i just clarify and stabilize it as is?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying a dandelion wine recipe as an experiment.  It started a little light on sugar (1.080 specific gravity) but i just went for it.  This was just something to experiment with anyway.  I noticed that the fermentation was a little slow based on fewer burps of the airlock per minute than i am used to.  I left it in primary for a long time (about 30 days) and it only got to about 1.030.

At this point, it is noticeably weak on alcohol and sweet.  I am pretty confident that the fermentation is stuck.  I racked it off to a secondary and am not sure what to do.  My first thought was to try and restart it with some fresh yeast, but since this thing is so experimental for me i don't want to waste material on a lost cause.  my other thought was to just clarify and stabilize it.  the taste is pleasant, but too weak for my liking.

**Ingredients used:**

1. 16#‚Äôs Kirkland‚Äôs Mixed Berry Blend ($10/ea) - Blueberry, Blackberry, Raspberry
2. Granulated Sugar, 20 cups
3. Lallzyme EX (.6g), Cellar Science
4. Italian Volcano 100% Organic Lemon Juice (50 oz), from Costco
5. FT Rouge (7.8g), Cellar Science
6. EC1118 Yeast (5g), Lalvin
7. Go-Ferm Protect Evolution (7.5g), Cellar Science
8. FermFed (DAP Free) (9g), Cellar Science
9. Fermaid K (6g), Cellar Science
10. Super-Kleer K.C. (2.2 oz), Liquor Quik (Kieselsol and Chitosan for fining)
11. Potassium Metabisulfite (.5 tsp), Cellar Science
12. Granulated Sugar (6#) boiled in 2 cups water until clear to make Simple Sugar

**Notes:**

1. Started on Saturday evening, April 25th;
2. Ready to begin enjoying on May 16th (4 weeks after start); it was really good at this point after back-sweetening, but I‚Äôm sure it will get even better over the next few months as everyone says (and ‚Äúregular‚Äù wines do)
3. All additions were based on starting w/6 gals of juice; ended up with a little over 4.5 gals of wine
4. I decided NOT to add Potassium Sorbate to sterilize any potentially remaining yeast before back-sweetening. My primary reasoning was that I filtered using a sterile filter so assuming that will eliminate the remaining yeast. I also didn‚Äôt want to do this because K-Sorbate actually starts to add vegetative flavors as the wine ages. Also, I plan to keg mine for easier access by the glass, so if it does start to ferment more then I‚Äôll be fine with a little ‚ÄúSparkling Dragons Blood‚Äù.   
 That said, if you plan to drink all your wine within a year then I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about that, and rather lean more toward short-term protection with K-Sorbate regardless of filtration.
5. Left lid sitting loosely on top of fermenter (not snapped down) and no airlock/bubbler in the lid grommet during active fermentation.

**4/25 - Sat. Evening:**

* Mixed all these ingredients together in 7 gal fermenting bucket to start

1. (A.) 16# frozen fruit in a mesh bag
2. Water to about 4.5 gals
3. (B.) Sugar, (C.) Enzyme, (D.) Lemon Juice

* Measured starting Specific Gravity (B-SG) @ 1.090
* Notes:
   * did NOT add K-Meta at this point;
   * did NOT add tannin or yeast nutrients at this point as called for in original DD recipe; rather, added those with yeast a day later

**4/26 - Sun. Morning**

* Added the following, stirring well

1. (E.) Tannin powder, (F.) Yeast, (G.) Yeast Nutrient

‚Ä¶ stirred twice a day until‚Ä¶  


**4/29 - Thur. Evening**

* Measured SG and noticed I was about halfway through ferment and it seemed to be slowing. So I added the following:

1. (H.) and (I.) Yeast Nutrients (note these are additional yeast nutrients at about 1/3 to 1/2 through ferment that are not called for in original DD recipe)

... nutrients obviously helped kick up the ferment and ensure completion!  
‚Ä¶ continued stirring twice a day until‚Ä¶  


**5/6 - Wed. Evening**

* Noticed that ferment was pretty much done w/SG @ 1.000
* Removed fruit bag ‚Äî it was TINY! Clearly the enzymes had helped to extract all the fruit we were going to get in this batch. 
* Added (K.) K-Meta to help protect since ferment was done (and yeast no longer providing CO2 blanket to protect from oxidizing)
* Snapped down fermenting bucket lid and added Bubbler
* Stopped stirring to let it settle so I could rack to carboy on Saturday

**5/9 - Sat. Evening**

* Measured finishing SG (F-SG) @ 0.990 ‚Äî ferment is done!
* Racked off of gross lees to carboy
* Added (J.) fining agents, stirring the heck out of it to help degas
* Let sit and clear for a week

**5/16 - Afternoon**

* Nice, small layer of fine lees at bottom of carboy; wine looking very nice and clear already!
* Filtered with .5 Micron filter using small Buon Vino filter
* Performed tests for:
   * pH (3.01) @ 71.8F;
   * TA @ .62% tartaric;
   * SO2 @ 3.2ppm;
   * F-SG @ 0.990 so ABV = \~13.5% (Whew! That‚Äôs hot!)
* Added (L.) 6# Simple Sugar to back-sweeten

The resulting wine is a beautiful, clear and brilliant ruby red. (My wife said it looks like a beautiful ruby jewel!) We enjoyed a couple glasses on ice and it‚Äôs yuuuumy already!   


**Closing thoughts and observations:**  
It‚Äôs obviously very young as I‚Äôm making these observations, but the week I was letting it clear I was tasting it along the way, adding granulated sugar to a glass to test how the sugar might offset the tartness (which was, WOW, super-tart!) It had a VERY pungent/funky nose! So much so that, after sweetening the glass with some sugar, I actually asked my wife and my cousin to NOT smell it before they each tasted it. They loved the taste! Then I asked them to nose it and they both were like, ‚ÄúOh my gosh! What is that?!‚Äù Needless to say, the nose and the taste experiences weren‚Äôt lining up well. After filtering and sweeting with the simple sugar that small has definitely waned quite a bit, so I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôll continue to blow off whatever that funky odor is. One thought I have about the odor is that it‚Äôs so strong because I added so much fruit ‚Äî notice almost 3x what DD‚Äôs recipe calls for. But, I also think that the reason it‚Äôs such a deep ruby color is exactly because I added so much fruit as well. It really does taste great.

About the amount of fruit: when I make regular wine from fresh fruit (vitis vinifera ‚Äî my daughter likes to call them ‚Äúwine berries‚Äù &lt;grin&gt;), I use 100# to make about the same six gallons of wine but I obviously don‚Äôt add the water. This was curious to me so it just seemed like I ‚Äúneeded more fruit‚Äù in this wine.  I‚Äôm wondering, however, if this almost 3x more fruit than DD‚Äôs recipe called for isn‚Äôt the reason for the strong pungent (raw berry?) smell at this young age of the wine? I‚Äôm optimistic that this smell will ‚Äúblow off‚Äù with age, as it certainly mellows as the wine opens up. Meaning, as I decant this wine now for about 30 minutes that smell is almost gone. I also think one positive benefit from using 16# of fruit (vs 6#) was to give the wine more body, making it less ‚Äúwatery‚Äù. So, the mouthfeel of this one is akin a little more to a Pino Noir rather than a Rose or blush wine. Maybe that‚Äôs good for some folks, or maybe that‚Äôs bad ‚Äî just depends on your individual preferences and goals with the type of target wine you‚Äôre trying to make. That‚Äôs one of the many beauty‚Äôs of this art we call winemaking! 

Cost: The wine berries I buy from the Grand Valley AVA here in Colorado cost \~$1/lb. Whereas, the Costco Mixed Berries on a $/lb basis come out to about $2.50/lb! So, one might think it would be cheaper to make vinifera wine (I typically make Merlot, Cab Sauv, Cab Franc and Riesling); but since the original DD recipe calls for only 6#‚Äôs of Mixed Berries, the total fruit cost is \~$10 (or free if you have it in your back yard!) vs $100 to make the same volume of wine (# bottles).

About taste and that 6# of simple sugar for back-sweetening‚Ä¶  That certainly is a lot of sugar to add, but this wine is actually not a viscous as an dessert/ice wine, as you might imagine adding that much sugar. It is sweet, for sure, but I did a number of taste tests (with my wife is the primary ‚Äúapprover‚Äù, of course ‚Äî how else do you think I get to keep spending money on this hobby! LOL ) using varying amounts of sugar from 5g sugar/50ml of wine to 15g sugar/50ml of wine and it really needed a bit more sugar to balance both the tartness and the alcohol level (‚Äùhotness‚Äù). So, I ended up at about 8g/50ml (or 15-16% RS) which is around a German Auslese style Riesling level of sweetness. It currently has a very nice sweet/acid/alcohol balance, with a nice, soft mouthfeel and a little longer finish. It definitely hits the tongue sweet at first, with very noticeable fruit in the mid-palate, and the slightest ‚Äúzing‚Äù due to the high alcohol has you breath in after swallowing. It‚Äôs definitely not your normal one-dimensional blush/fruit wine! One final interesting note on taste here is that I get no hint of bitter tannin at all. So, I‚Äôm confident the FT Rouge contributed to the mouthfeel, but there‚Äôs definitely no ‚Äúrip your teeth off tannin‚Äôs‚Äù if you‚Äôre worried about that at all. I think you‚Äôd have to add a lot more tannin powder before you‚Äôd feel that‚Ä¶which, you may if that‚Äôs your thing! 

About the amount of sulfite: I prefer a lower sulfite wine in general and this wine ended up at about 3.5 ppm. I think this will be fine and provide enough protection due to a few factors: lower pH @ 3.01 (see graph), higher ABV of 13.5% and an on-point TA at \~ .62% tartaric.

"Hydrometer readings, degassing during primary fermentation At the beginning of the month, I got a 6 gal bucket of Malbec juice. I put some crushed up campden tablets in it, let that gas off for ~24 hours, took a hydrometer reading, it was about 1.090, then pitched my yeast.

I stirred the wine every day or so for 10-12 days. At this point, the hydrometer read a little under 1.000, and I racked it but the wine is still bubbly. Is this normal? If so, what can I do to minimize/eliminate bubbles? Could I be reading the hydrometer wrong? How can I test to make sure my hydrometer is accurate?

My last 3 batches have been similar, where I let primary fermentation go until the wine is dry (according to the hydrometer), but it's still a little bubbly, almost like a vinho verde, but I'd prefer to have a completely still wine. My last two batches sat in secondary fermentation for over a year and still didn't get completely flat!",winemaking

"Rhubarb Wine My buddy and I are about to put up a batch of rhubarb wine. Usually each year we dump a stupid amount of cane sugar in with chopped rhubarb (and I think some orange zest and juice).  Generally ferment about a 10% Rhubarb wine. Nothing too fancy, carbonate the hell out of it and pretend like its champagne. I personally don't like it very much as it tastes very boring and only a hint of rhubarb flavor comes thru. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year our plan is to freeze rhubarb during the harvesting season and then crush and press thru our equipment we use for apples. and check brix, and if only 12-13 brix, maybe add a little bit of cane sugar. My buddy wants to ferment the chopped rhubarb and then press post primary ferm and then put right into a keg to carbonate. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? My argument is to press beforehand to do as little oxidation to the ferment as possible?

"Some fruits losing all taste after fermenting. Hey everyone!

I'm new to the wine scene. Last year my dad pretty much dumped about 100 pounds or apples and peaches. (We have quite a few trees)

The apple wine was made with many varieties and so was the peach. Both have a great color but both are borderline flavorless.

I've made a pineapple and a cranberry pineapple (fresh fruit) and that came out pretty bland too.

However, I've made mead, cranberry, black cherry, and sweet tea wines that were phenomenal.

I've purchased natural fruit flavoring in an attempt to not lose 8 gallons of salvageable wine.

In stores peach wine is commonly white grape with peach added. Should that be the approach? Should I stop the fermentation to leave flavor for these fruits? Make cider? Any advice is appreciated.

I have been keeping some bottles of red and sparkling white in a cupboard that has a pretty stable temperature of roughly 26c. I have done a little research to try to work out how long it is OK to store them at that temperature and have come to the conclusion that it is definitely going to be aging faster than it should.

"Might have just ruined a $60,000 wine collection. I have a question or two. The cooler for my cellar broke, and overheated while I was away. So, for about a week, it spent that time heating up the whole 12'x12' cellar. The problem is, that during that week, it heated up the entire space from 59¬∞F up to 113¬∞F and brought the humidity down to 16%, from 60%.

Immediately upon discovery, I moved every case out into the garage to let it cool down overnight. This morning, the bottle temperature was 56¬∞F, and humidity was 65%.

No corks popped, and no sparkling wines lost crown caps, either. 

What do you believe the future has in store for my wine? If I'm being optimistic, maybe it just means my wine aged a few years prematurely. Pessimistically, I believe the whole thing may be a total loss. 

I'm too afraid to open bottles to find out. 

What should I expect? On the bright side, I paid for none of this wine; it was all a gift. So, there would be a $0 monetary loss.

I get the feeling I should start opening the 10+ year old wines, as they are likely to be the most affected. Everything else is still rather young (vintages 2019 - 2016).

"Lockup Wine Kit ABV Help Hi all. 
During lockdown I have had my first go at winemaking. Bought a Cellar 7 kit. Followed instructions and produced a ‚Äòdrinkable‚Äô red wine. All well and good but according to my (cheap) hydrometer it‚Äôs approx 10-11%. 
I would prefer my wine a bit more boozy. I understand the kit is made in a way to make the optimum bottle of wine out of the ingredients supplied. Also grasp that certain yeasts don‚Äôt perform well at higher ABV. 

All things considered I don‚Äôt expect the wine from a ¬£35 kit to be great (perhaps if I left it for a while to age in the bottle it would get better, but being my first attempt I can‚Äôt wait and have guzzled quite a bit of it already ü•≥) 
By my reckoning if it ain‚Äôt great, then it would be better being a bit more boozy than less so. 

So my question is. 
Is it as simple as adding more sugar to my primary fermentation brew?
Or simply adding less water?

Pros/cons of each?

I started two new kits this afternoon 

Solomon Grundy Shiraz ¬£36 
5 Ltr grape juice ADDED ONLY 16Ltr water(Recommended 18ltrs). Supposed to be bottle able/drinkable in 7 days. Just over 20 ltrs brew to hopefully make 24/25 bottles wine. Initial hydro reading 1.078

Kenridge Cabernet Merlot ¬£50
10 Ltr grape juice. Added 13 Ltr water. 23 ltrs brew. 4 week til ready to bottle. Hydro reading 1.080. 30 bottles

I think the Kenridge will be good as more grape juice, and should get probably 28/29 bottles hopefully around 12-13%

The Solomon Grundy I added less water than instructions dictated. So I will have a stronger wine hopefully around 12-13%, just less of it. 


I think I will just leave them and see what happens. But for arguments sake could I boil up 2 ltr sugary water and add it to the Solomon Grundy to up the ABV and get a couple extra bottles. Started fermentation approx 10hrs ago. 
And just out of interest...
How much theoretical sugar should be added to the 2 ltrs ...

"How long from fermentation to bottling for white wines? reds? (This is a 6 gallon kit) I have a chardonnay kit which I have improved on to attempt to make a much better tasting wine. I added a pound of grape skins/seeds I got from a friend with a small personal vineyard which I fermented on for two weeks before racking to a new carboy as well as some oak chips. It‚Äôs now mostly cleared in that second carboy and it‚Äôs been a month. I tasted it today and it has great body and tannin structure and I love where it‚Äôs headed, but still has the heat of a young wine. I also tested Brix as I diluted the kit so i could ensure a good body and ABV content and it‚Äôs sitting at 13.8% right now. I know red wines benefit from a year in the carboy before bottling, or at least that‚Äôs what I hear. This all leads me to two questions:

1: How long is normal aging period in carboys for white wines before bottling? A year for reds seems reasonable but seems like too long for white which don‚Äôt age as gracefully. (If you also happen to agree that reds don‚Äôt need a full year, how long do you age them?)

2: This chardonnay is in a secondary and has cleared entirely to the naked eye (though I know there‚Äôs more I can‚Äôt see). It is does not seem to have any residual carbonation as per my taste test and I assume this is because of when I racked it. Is a tertiary carboy beneficial before bottling? When and for how long for each of the aging do you all do?

"Small Wineries and Consumers: struggles, desired outcomes, strategies and support... Hi everyone, 

this community is very interesting and inspiring. As being a wine enthusiast and lover myself, I am very motivated when I see so many people trying to master the craft of wine making. I wish you all a great success.

As loving the wine so much, it is only natural for me to have this great vision of making my own wine, vineyard and winery. But before I leap into it I want to do some research and see what the points I should be aware of are. I want to understand the problems that small wineries are facing, as well as people who like and prefer to buy and drink wine from small wineries, homemade wine makers and similar. I find that this community, all together has a lots of experience and I hope you can help me.

By having this input I would be able to focus on certain problems and struggles and see how I could improve it or even fix it. 

1. If some of you already have a small winery or are familiar with some, I am interested to know more about the struggles of making one happen and keeping it afloat. In the sea of winemakers and well established brands, what **can**, **should** and **shouldn‚Äôt** you do in order to put your name and wine out there and make your passion of wine making also profitable for the benefit of your consumers, staff and family. My guess is that distribution, competition, brand building and strategies are some of the areas you are struggling with, but I would like to learn more.
2. On the other hand, I would like to learn more about the consumers (such as myself ‚Äì until I become a wine maker one day ;) )  that like to experiment with wine, try as much as they can  and give a chance and support to not so known names in wine making, to smaller wineries and to be authentic in their palate, wine collection and taste in general, not just go for the mainstream.

"Re-bottling questions Hey everyone!  


I work for a WSET course provider, and we are looking at adapting to this changing situation and focusing on online courses mainly. The main issue with this is being able to provide the students with the wine samples they will need, so we have decided to re-bottle the wines, transferring them from the classic 750ml to small 50ml containers that we can post to the students.

 What would be the best method to re-bottle, maintaining the quality and allowing the wine to be ok for at least a month after the re-rebottling? We imagine that we would have to sparge/blanket with argon or nitrogen, but we don't know if there is a simpler method that won't require us to buy and install an incredibly expensive bespoke bottling line. 

Is there another method to transfer the wine anaerobically or adding gas? Could this job be outsourced to a bottling company? Would they be ok adapting to such small containers?

"Looking for advice with Haskap and Raspberry wine I picked the fruit and made this wine last year. It has been racked once. Unfortunately life got busy and I didn't bottle it when I should have. It has been sitting in carboys for the last 9 months. The airlocks went dry at some point and I added water as soon as I noticed.  I would like to sample and bottle it now that I have some time. At this point I'm not sure how I should proceed. I would like to rack it a couple more times but I am wondering if exposing the wine to additional oxygen would compromise the taste. Perhaps I should just bottle it without additional racking?

Can anyone offer advice on how to salvage this wine?

"Mother-In-Laws Muscadine wine I have a question that i have tried to research and find the answer for and have been unable so i turn to my fellow wine makers.  Last year i started making Muscadine wine with my mother in law after i tried her batch of wine.  It was very good but after seeing her recipe i figured if we did some research and get some better supplies we could really improve upon it.  OK so here is the part i don't understand.  In her recipe which i have no idea where she got it and i haven't seen anything similar it calls for  1 gallon of muscadines, 9 pounds of sugar, 3 gallons of water and 1 pkg of bread yeast.  She mixes the ingredients all together lets it sits for a day then she puts it 1 gallon jugs with latex balloons as airlocks.   We have since done 3 or 4 batches of the typical type recipes you would get online.  Ex. wine yeast, nutrient, etc we even have a hydrometer and have been keeping notes of our process.   We mix all the ingredients including campden tablets  together then add the yeast the next day.   We stir it daily for about 5-6 days then bottle it into 1 gallon jugs with regular airlocks.  The confusing part is that her recipe has repeatedly turned out better and i have no idea why, even more frustrating it doesn't even seem like her recipe should work at all.

"First time making wine, looking for some advice Hello all! I just stumbled upon this subreddit at the best time. 

With this lockdown, I took it upon myself to give home wine making a shot. A friend got me wilkos express wine yeast compound. So I got some 100% organic juice. This is a very basic and amateur approach to making wine at home, but the point is to just dip my toe first before jumping right in.

So what i am doing is making the wine in the same bottle the juice came in, it's a 1 liter bottle. Since it's already sterilized it would make this an easy start. I poured out a bit of the juice, heated it up and dissolved a 1/4 of a cup of sugar in it. Which was I added back to the bottle and shook it. Then I added a bit of the wilkos yeast.

Everything is going splendidly so far! A few days later the bubbles started to really ramp up, as I do not have an airlock I am using the condom method. Again please bare with me, its a VERY amateur approach I know. 

So far things are looking beautifully, but I have a question. It's seems there's a build up on the top of the bottle. Similar to fruit pulp and what not. The smell is perfectly fine and sweet still. So no issues there. My main concern, once this finishes fermenting, how should I go about pouring it out? I certainly don't want to mix it all up and have a cloudy thick final result. But I also don't know whether this is actually a BAD sign in the wine fermenting process. From my research, it seems most things should be settling at the bottom and the top should be clear. I have the opposite so far, the top is thick pulpy mess, strange since its from juice not actual fruits. Can someone advise on what this build is exactly? And should he concerned? Once the fermentation is finished, as in when the bubbles stop, how do I go about transferring it to another container?


All advice is highly appreciated and thank you for your time.

Much love",winemaking

Lastly, how much **irrigation** is this mini-vineyard going to need? And will the vines need any extra care in the winter, given the hardiness they have bred into them?

"Reducing acidity of cold climate wines I am brewery owner, and my love of wine has been growing over the years. Using local ingredients in the beers is something important to me, and making wine from locally-grown grapes is also something I value.

Personally, I am a red wine lover. I am spoiled by the big, tannic, fruity wines of the West Coast and Italy. Here on the East Coast (Pennsylvania) we have a number of producers making really excellent white wines, but the red wines (both vinifera and hybrid varieties) tend to be quite acidic.  I have been doing research for the past week to learn about why, and it seems to do with the amount of ripening growers are able to achieve in a season. Is this correct?

I am curious if there has been progress in producing colder climate red wines that have more balance? Are there tricks or methods to reduce the acidity in the final product? It seems that wineries focus on single varietals; am I wrong to think that blends would help create more balanced and expressive wines?

To any east coast growers/vintners here, I mean no insult or offense. It's genuine curiosity on my part.",winemaking

"Fermenting Pinot Noir got a little too hot while I wasn't watching. First time winemaker, doing 6 gallons of Pinot Noir. 

Long story short, everything has been going well bubbling away, but the primary was getting a little cooler than I had hoped (~62F) and the bubbling started to slow, so I employed a fermwrap to raise it a few degrees (was hoping 80F). Came back to check on it a few hours later and it was at 97F(!). I didn't even think the fermwrap could raise temps that much, so I removed the fermwrap and put a fan on it to help passively cool it while I'm actively monitoring the temp.

"First attempt - please comment on my method. Covid19 lockdown boredom and the fact that our alcohol sales have been banned during this time got me interested in home wine making as a hobby :)

I started my very first experimental batch 5 days ago from info I could gather online. Would really appreciate some input and things I might be doing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Note:

\- I am stuck with what I had at home and mostly only consumable items are allowed for sale.  This means no hydrometer, anchor instant bakers dry yeast and plastic containers.  
\- I am aiming to create a **dry red wine**.  
\- With this substandard type of yeast I hope to reach 10% ABV which influenced my guess of how many sugar I needed to add.  
\- The ambient temperature where fermentation is happening so far ranged from 19 - 21 deg C (66 - 70 F).  We are going into winter and this was the warmest place I could find and it is bound to go down a few degrees more as time progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Method so far:

Day 1: bought 19kg black, seedless, sweet tasting, bulk/discounted grapes.  After removing stems and bad grapes I ended up with **15kg (33 pounds) of grapes**. I washed and crushed these by hand and added them to a sanitised, open, plastic container.  Added **10 liters (2.6 gal) of spring water.** Added an **7 cups of sugar** (I added 7 cups more on day 3). **Added 20 grams (0.7 ounce) of yeast**. Mixed well trying to aerate with oxygen.  The total mix resulted in about 25 - 27 litres (\~7 gal) volume.  Covered with cloth.  The next day it was properly bubbling.

Day 2 - 5:  Pushed down rising grapes 3 times a day - initially more vigorous to incorporate O2 and less (only pushing down) as time progressed to avoid too much O2.  On day 3 I added **7 more cups  of sugar** in a small amount of liquid comprising of water, strong tea and fresh lemon juice (heard tea + lemon can be a homemade yeast nutrient).  Adding this extra sugar mix \`re-ignited\` the bubbling within a few hours which were waning a bit since observing the first reaction.  On day 5 it was still bubbling at - which I would guess - a sufficient rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Intention going forward:

Day 6 - 9: Keep pushing grapes down once or twice daily

Day 10: Siphon off the liquid into new seal-able 4 liter (1 gal) plastic containers.  My airlock will consist of a plastic sandwich bag cable tied close around the openings with a small hole to release pressure when needed.  If I can find balloons by then I will use those instead.  I am not really sure what to do with the leftover grapes/must at this stage.  Thinking of throwing them in a cloth and lightly squeezing out the liquid and distribute equally among the containers?

Day 20: Siphon again into similar clean containers to get rid of sediment.  I am considering adding a small amount of **store bought gelatin** to aid in the clearing process?

Day 30 - 40: Siphon in to glass bottles (which I hope to find by then) and seal for long term aging. I probably **won't have sulfates** to add at this stage.  Is there alternative I can buy in a basic grocery store that would act as preservative?

Day 50: Start tasting a the first bottle (maybe 1 a week) if our alcohol sales are still banned :)

"An Island Nation of Redditors with legalized drugs  

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE‚Äôs and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

I cannot think of any parts of the process that have gone wrong or that were done poorly - everything has gone very well except, possibly, we did let it sit in tank for a LONG time before doing the first racking ... we pressed off the skins on Oct. 25 and it sat, undisturbed (decent acidity and 14+ alcohol) for ... 3 months ?  It was a while.

Other than that, it's all been very by the book.

So now we are tasting it and I don't exactly know what I am tasting.

On the one hand, I am quite certain it is not ""bad"" as in spoiled.  On the other hand, it's definitely not great.  My hope is that I simply have totally un-oaked Pinot that has lived its entire life in stainless and that I can improve and polish it with oak (or other treatments ?)

I don't have a highly educated or sophisticated pallet, so bear with me while I try to describe ...

In the front of the mouth and held in the mouth it's quite good, but then as you swallow, you get an ... almost numbing in the back-top of the mouth and there is a very dulling aftertaste to it ...

When I think of oaking, I think of very tannic wine that gets softened by the oak, but I don't feel like this wine is very tannic at all ... 

It's almost like you have Pinot Noir in your mouth and it turns to chardonnay as you swallow it :)

Any thoughts ?",winemaking
"1st Time Making Wine, just started 2nd Fermentation. Can I drink the excess? Just like it says. My fiance and I made it for the first time a week ago using grapes.

"Advice on Malbec from imported Chilean juice. Hi All.  I love a good South American Malbec, and am aiming to get some 30 gallons of imported juice in a couple weeks to take a shot at it.  However, I've never really tinkered around with it before and am looking for some recipe pointers.  Looking to replicate more of an Argentinian style malbec, with a drier, almost spiciness to it.

Any advice from yeast selections and additives, to actual handling and aging is much much appreciated.

Thank you all in advance.",winemaking

"Winemaking licenses Good afternoon (or morning),  


I have scoured the internet for this answer and I can't seem to find it. I am applying to the TTB right now to become a bonded winery. Once that gets approved, then the ABC application gets submitted. Does anyone know if it is possible to begin fermentations while the winegrower license is being approved?  


The reason I ask is because the TTB should get through the application in 60ish days. The ABC will probably take another 3 months. That would be put at the end of September for getting approved and harvest begins in the middle to late August. Does the ABC let people make wine for the winery if the person has TTB approval but the ABC winegrower license is in process of being approved? I tried to begin working with the landlord of the warehouse my parents rent from for their business back in January. He has literally taken a month and a half to get back to us with each question. So now it is May and things are finally moving along but I am afraid I lost my chance for this year if the ABC license needs to be approved as well before any winemaking begins.  


Any insights?

"Have I ruined my wine? Hi all,  
I'm new at making wine, so I bought a 3 week kit that included everything. 
The box says the wine should be around 10% when finished.  
So, I added everything together and let it ferment for a couple of weeks.   
Then I thought I would make it stronger by adding another 1kg of sugar and let it ferment more.   
It bubbled away nicely. But now I've reached 3 and a half weeks and it's still cloudy and bubbling once every 1-2 minutes. The gravity reading is at 0.995.  
I'm a bit unsure as to what to do.   

Any advice?",winemaking

"Good/bad Flor? Okay, so I made a great orange sherry-style wine that aged under a Flor last year. It was fabulous. I've made the wine again. It has a flor forming. But that got me curious: are there different kinds of Flor? Or are they all the same? If this wine turns out as good as the last one, should I plan on keeping the Flor alive and constant by creating a psuedo solera system?

The last vintage was amazing and I'm curious to see how I can keep making this style of wine.",winemaking
"Can wild yeast be dangerous to drink? I‚Äôm trying out making a minimalistic wine 100% out of things left over around the house. So I put together a starter today out of some apple peels, lemon juice, honey and water. I‚Äôm considering dropping some blueberries in the starter as I grow them in my yard, whereas the apple peels were from the grocery store and I washed them when I got them home. I also have frozen peaches. 

**But what I‚Äôm concerned about, is if I just haphazardly dump all this random stuff in and get it to ferment, is there a chance that I‚Äôll make something that will hurt someone who drinks it? Like might I accidentally breed a harmful bacteria?**

Again, I‚Äôm doing this totally minimalistic style, even down to using a homemade airlock, so I know I should just buy brewers yeast and all the gear to do it right, but that defeats the point of my experiment doing it with just left over home resources. Thanks for any advice!",winemaking

"Industry folks - I have $2M-$3M in liquid capital to spend starting a world class winery or lose it trying. I'm leaning towards Willamette AVA and looking for actionable advice moving forward! I'm not currently involved with the winemaking industry, so please let me know where any of this sounds insane. (Warning: all of it may sound insane).

**Who am I:** My formal education is in graduate level quantitative science and I founded a technology startup (not software) several years ago which recently closed an acquisition deal. This has brought in a significant windfall of cash. I've enjoyed the process of taking this startup from concept stage to market but I am looking for a major life change. I want to start on a creative endeavor where I work with my hands and the earth. I love wine and see it as a form of artistic expression. No doubt Burgundy pinot is a phenomenal creation of humankind. I've brewed beer at home for several years (mostly aged sours) and roasted coffee commercially on a very small scale.

**My Goal:** I'm in my early thirties and looking to do 2 years of preparation before I make any kind of commitment. My goal is to focus on creating a world class wine first and foremost without being burdened by cash flow strain. I'm not looking to speed towards break-even by hiring a crack marketing team to push distributions, tastings, events, etc. I don't want to pay a winery to print me a few cases of my ""private label"" (oh my God is that embarrassing). What I aim to do is get online as quickly as possible with a decent product that has potential and start adjusting variables from there. I'm very much leaning towards cool-climate Pinot Noir, Gamay, and Chardonnay, such as grown in Willamette and Burgundy. But open to other ideas...

**My Thoughts on First Steps:** As I said before, I want to limit prep time to 2 years. My first inclination is to rent a house near Napa, attend viticulture/oenology classes at UC Davis, and participate in a local harvest. I would also be interested in working for a custom crush facility to see how they operate. Concurrent with that I'd do an in-depth tour of the Willamette valley, and compare grapes from different sub AVAs while keeping an eye on the property market. Once ready, I would probably purchase a 20-30 acre vineyard with producing vines that either has wine-making onsite or uses custom crush facility. I recognize I will need to hire an experienced vineyard manager and cellar master before I can take this on myself.

**Questions so many questions:** What is the most expeditious way to get educated? Are UCD classes worth it - should I look into the full 2 year program or do a shorter online version? Should I do harvest or just look for work at a custom crush? I prefer west coast- is Willamette the right area or is this already too saturated (CA seems extremely saturated)? How much capital would I be expected to put up vs how much I can get from bank/SBA/etc. Assuming rule of thumb 20% down, would $1M be enough to get me a $5M property? How do you even go about looking for property (i.e. local real estate agent? Winegrowers association? Internet?). What are the best books I can buy? Should I buy producing vines or grow from seedling? What clones should I look for? Should I live on the vineyard property or off-site? Who is the first person I should talk to about this plan besides random strangers on the internet? (consultant? networking event? another winemaker?). Thanks guys!

I've been doing some research, but would also like some recommendations on what is close to that and able to be grown in zone 5.

I asked DoubeAVineyards, and they said their waiting list is so long that I likely wouldn't get any next year either.

"I finished a few batches of my first ""juice wine"". I made some mistakes and here's what I learned. As easy as it is to buy a half-gallon of juice from the store, empty a cup or two out, add in a cup or two of sugar and a teaspoon of yeast, shake well and let sit (with the cap slightly open to allow CO2 out), I messed it up a little. Here's what I learned: 

\*I introduced air accidentally when tasting/smelling during fermentation:

Do not open the cap and smell it or taste it until your ready to ""rack"" it or drink it. I made this mistake on my first batch. I smelled it a few times a few days into it. I tasted it at about 10 days in. I tasted it again like 14 days in (very tiny taste tests). And I finally decided to enjoy it at about 20 days in. On that day I noticed that there was white mold looking stuff growing on the plastic where there was room for foam. Unsure, I opened it to smell it, and it made me gag. It was way sour. I am pretty certain that with all my fidgeting/smelling/tasting, I must have kept letting air in and  CO2 out. I discarded it. It made me gag!

On the other two batches, I had going at around the same time, I was a little better at letting them be. Although I did open, and smell one of them a handful of times, and tasted it 1 time at about 14 days in. It tasted good, but I didn't end up drinking it until a few days later. I noticed it too ended up smelling sour but not nearly as bad as that discarded batch. Unsure of how these batches are supposed to turn out, I thought that's how it is supposed to be. I went ahead and shared some and we just added sugar to each glass. It was ok but I was disappointed. 

On the last batch of apple wine I had going, I left it alone entirely until I decided to enjoy it. This was a few days ago. I assumed it would be just as sour as that last batch, but to my surprise, it was pretty delicious. It smelled mostly of apples and had a bit of a alcohol smell, but nothing bad at all - it was expected and hoped for. Tasted great. Actually, it tasted pretty amazing considering how cheap/simple it was to make. Exactly what I had initially hoped for! 

So lesson learned: don't touch your juice wine until your ready to rack it or drink it! Apparently, oxygen is the enemy (and I'm all the other microbes I unintentionally let in while handling it during fermentation).

I'm glad I didn't give up.",winemaking
"Can a high pH stop fermentation or is it lack of nutrients? I made a mead 2 months ago, it's not the first time using this recipe only difference is I used a different yeast and added the juice and zest of 2-3 oranges. The recipe called for only the zest. It started at 1.100 and 2 months in its at 1.010 so I figured it was not going to go any further and added sodium metabisulphite and I going to let it age.

So my question is is it the high pH because I added the orange juice or lack of nutrients (for the nutrients I only use Young's yeast nutrient witch contains Diammonium Phosphate, Ammonium Sulphate)...

The funny thing is that it tastes amazing even though it's only 2 months old. I put oak chips and it lifted up the flavour...

"Modified 19th Century Dandelion Wine Recipe w/Photos. ###Modified 19th Century Dandelion Wine 1 Gallon Batch

##Preparing for Primary Fermentation 

Ingredients for Primary Fermentation:

- 450 grams/1 lb. [Dandelion petals](https://imgur.com/a/Csd2TR6) without no green plant material
- 1.4 kilogram/3 lb. sugar
- 1 orange
- 2 lemons
- 142 grams/ 5 oz. raisins 
- 4 grams/ 1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (DAP)
- 1 gram wine yeast
- 1 campden tablet
- 1 gal. spring water

S.G.: 1.130   F.G.: 1.022

1. Begin by stripping the dandelions of all green plant materiel.

2. Carefully zest or peel the citrus taking care not to get any of the pith (white layer between peel and fruit). Save the remainder of the fruit.

3. In a clean &amp; sanitized fermenter, crush the campden tablet and put into bottom of fermenter. Also add the raisins and nutrients (DAP). Juice the citrus and add. 

4. In large stock pot: add water, sugar, citrus peels/zest and dandelion petals. Stirring until sugar dissolves, bring to a boil. * I used a extra fine reusable nylon brew bag for the flower petals *

5. Once boiling reduce heat to slow boil. While stirring/steeping petals continue to boil for 60 minutes.

6. Remove stock pot from heat to cool.

7. Strain and add must from stock pot when it is still slightly warm into fermenter. Add an airlock without any liquid/sanitizer in it. Allow to sit at room temperature a full 24 hours for the campden to sanitize the must.

8. Rehydrate wine yeast according to package instructions.

9. Pitch yeast into must and mix well. Fill the airlock and place onto the fermenter.

10. Stir for the first 3 days to aerate the [must](https://imgur.com/a/1U9R975).


##Preparing for Secondary Fermenter

Ingredients for Secondary Fermentor:

- 80 grams/ 2.8 oz. [dandelion petals](https://imgur.com/a/6VCh2cE) without any green plant material.

- .10 grams potassium metabisulfate  

- 12 fl. oz. spring water

- 15ml. glycerin 

1. Bring spring water to boil.

2. Place dandelion petals in sanitized &amp; clean jar (w/ lid) with the potassium metabisulfate.

3. Pour 12 fl. oz. of hot spring water into the jar over the petals. Close the lid and shake well. Set aside until completely cool. If prepared before time of racking into secondary, place jar into freezer.

4. When ready to use the dandelion petals in secondary (remove them from freezer if you chose to freeze them) and loosen lid on jar to where it‚Äôs barely on and let sit a full 24 hours.

5. Racked day 5 from primary fermenter to secondary leaving behind raisins/lees.

6. Add the 80 grams of [dandelion petals](https://imgur.com/a/i2Ku3Mq) and spring water into secondary.

7. Degas daily and punch down cap formed of petals.

8. After 5 days [racked](https://imgur.com/a/sbD3Cxr) again into clean sanitized carboy adding the 15ml. glycerin and removing petals from secondary.

9. A week and a half later it cleared. I added campden tablet and bottled. Original recipe said to cellar for at least 6 months. Note: the wine appearance will be slightly hazy, light golden color and not completely crystal clear. 



**How it was modified:**
- * Originally the recipe called for 1lb. of raisins, I reduced that to 5oz.*
- *The recipe called for 1/4 of a yeast cake in which I am certain meant bread yeast. I chose to use CDB wine yeast.*
- *I used yeast nutrient (DAP).*
- *I used campden/metabisulfate.*
- *For the orange I used a blood orange peel and juice.*
- *Added 15ml. glycerin for extra body and mouthfeel.*

Notes: I debated how much to modify the recipe. I considered using SNA with GoFerm, Fermaid O, Fermaid K. 
   I grew up listening to the older generation talking about dandelion wine. My dad use to talk about how his brother and him use to be sent out to pick the dandelions by his dad. I know my great grandfather and grandfather both use to make this wine. However my dad had no interest in making it. Dad use to say that the older generation believed that the dandelion wine possessed medicinal properties, but I honestly don‚Äôt know how accurate that is. My dad passed a few years ago and I wish I would‚Äôve asked him more about his memories concerning making the wine. I do believe that the original recipe probably evolved slowly over time and I hope to produce something similar to what my elders consumed. I thought others may like to try making it for themselves. 
   Considering it‚Äôs made with a weed that most people seem to despise it‚Äôs easy to harvest enough flowers, though my neighbor looked at me like I was slightly mentally impaired when I asked if I could pick his dandelions.
   I chose to add the additional petals to secondary in an attempt to obtain some more of the natural floral notes and flavors. By following the recipes requirement of boiling for 60 minutes I wondered how much of the delicate floral notes may have been lost. Also, during the boil it develops a sweet and starchy aroma similar to the smell of sweet corn on the cob being boiled. I tasted the must before pitching the yeast and it had a pleasant flavor although obviously sweet. At bottling it tasted young but had pleasant, warm floral notes and finished sweet at a little over 14%ABV. I‚Äôm currently on the hardest phase of winemaking.... the waiting period for aging.",winemaking
"How long for primary fermentation I am new to home brewing, I made my first gallon of concord grape juice, sugar, and a whole packet of champaign yeast from red star. I used a 1-gallon jar with 2.5 cups of sugar and about 0.75-0.80 gallons of concord grape juice.
My two-chamber airlock activity has slowed down significantly, but still releases a CO2 bubble, and there is still positive pressure. There are also small bubbles rising to the top of the wine as well. There has been a color change as well, turning from dark purple to a more burgundy red. There is some sediment on the bottom as well.

"How to get into winemaking? Hello! I've been following you guys for a long while now, and I think the community is amazing. I finally have a bit of money saved up and am ready to start my wine journey!

To be frank, I have no idea what I'm doing, so I thought I'd pose my questions to you guys before I spend a lot of unnecessary money. (I'm located in the US.)

1. I want to do the whole process myself; is plastic worse than glass? What's the reusability of plastic containers? 

2. Are wine kits the way to go for a first time, or should I get fresh? If kits, is there a specific wine kit that worked well for anyone? I tend to prefer low tannin reds, but I'm very open to trying new things. 

3. I live in a very hot place; how critical is temperature control? Does it vary from stage to stage? Should I store my finished product inside at all times? 

4. Is there a recommended equipment set that's best for purchase? I'd like to do 5 gallons or more at a time. 

5. I love the idea of making new flavors or combinations of odd but tasty wines; are there any fruits (aside from durian) or spices that are a definite no-go? Has anyone had success with things like a√ßa√≠ or kumquat or kiwi?

I got a 23 litre carboy and a 54 litre demijohn off a guy on kijiji.¬†We¬†both initially thought¬†they were smaller volumes.


I last made wine years ago, in a drunken haze. We ended up not doing secondary fermentation and just racking it all after waiting too long. It still turned out decent every time.


I was looking at some PDFs of kit instructions and primary fermentation generally wants altogether 23 liters of liquid, which is pretty much the brim. If I measured the volume right they is,¬†and I'm about 75% sure I did.


I'm wondering if it's a good or bad idea to do primary fermentation in the 54 liter demijohn and then secondary fermentation in the 23 liter carboy. The guy included an airlock for the carboy but not the demijohn.


Alternatively, I'm thinking I could use a bit less water and just do the one fermentation before bottling. Might be the lazy reintroduction.

"First timer dandelion wine So I have started my first ever home brew! I used about 1.5L of Dandelion petals, and put them in a big pan with about 5L water. When this got to the boil I added one lemon zested and chopped and about 150g of raisins. I added 1.5kg of sugar to this and dissolved it all.

"Help! First stalled fermentation! This is our 5th batch of fruit wine, having done strawberry, peach, cherry, passion fruit and now blueberry, but the first time we've hit this wall.

5 gallon batch, from frozen blueberries, Cotes de Blanc yeast, white sugar, acid blend, etc

Initial gravity was 1.074, that was on 1/30

By 2/22, we had racked once, and the gravity was 1.03 so I let it go longer

3/15 no change, so first advice I found was to stir it up, disturb the yeasts and try to wake them

3/18 no change, so I added a little more yeast 

3/31 still nothing, so I bought some fresh blueberries, made a syrup of the fruit and sugar, added that and more yeast. 

4/14 no change (still reading 1.03) which means something fermented since adding sugar would raise it (I think) we racked it again here. 

4/26 still reading 1.03 (yes I tested my hydrometer to be sure it wasn't broken) I made up another batch of syrup, and added more yeast

I have around 340 liters of very good and stable Merlot wine. In 2019 i filtered my 2018 merlot with 12 pieces of filter tablets and it was a total success, i won x2 Absolute Gold etc. But this 2019 wine that i am about to bottle during the next week i am not so certain what to do.

  
The color is a bit skinny for Merlot, and i am afraid if i filter it that it will go away totally.

"Baby's first wine - raspberry or honeysuckle? Hey there! Long time lurker, first time fermenter.

I've wanted to make my own wine for ages, and finally got a kit (Northern Brewer's basic winemaking kit) to do so. It came with everything but the fruit, basically. So I got some frozen raspberries (since that's a lot easier to get my hands on right now than wine grapes) with the intention of making that my first wine.

I did some googling and discovered I could make wine out of it. However, I'm anxious, since I've never made any wine before, and now I'm wondering if it's worth it to try or if it's wiser to pass it by and stick to the raspberries.

"First time wine making My sister and I wanted to try to make fruit wine. We don‚Äôt have a lot of money to buy a lot of specialty equipment and find wine grapes. Using juice and sugar is what we can afford right now. I‚Äôve been looking at a bunch of recipes that use regular yeast or bread yeast, and it takes about 6 weeks, give or take.

"2nd batch with same issue Hey folks, really enjoy this sub and the help!

I‚Äôve now bottled 2 batches of white (1 14 months ago, 1 just now) from juice buckets, and they both have the same problem.  The problem is that they seem effervescent. 

Both wines were acid adjusted, primary fermented in bucket, added sulfates then moved to carboy for secondary.  Racked several times throughout.  Both cold stabilized, and hit with a little more sulfites before bottling.  

Both batches were degassed using the ‚Äúclean bottle express‚Äù degasser attached to my drill and also given several days of negative pressure using a Houdini pump on a bung.  

When I tasted the wine before adding sulphites and bottling this effervescent property wasn‚Äôt present. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  The only other thing that I thought was odd was upon adding sulphites before bottling the whole batch got real bubbly.  Maybe that‚Äôs normal, but I degassed again after that step.",winemaking

"New to wine making, I think I have something growing in my wine Hello!
About a month ago I started a batch of blueberry wine. As I‚Äôm on quarantine and really was just bored, I used bread yeast (pls do not come after me for this, I know it‚Äôs bad). It‚Äôs been happily bubbling along. I racked it a couple days ago as I had a heavy amount of sediment on the bottom and fermentation seemed to be slowing. I did notice lots of floaty bits once it was bumped around a bit which I deduced were yeast. 

However, since the racking I‚Äôve noticed some sediment type stuff clinging to the sides of my bottle and a ton of sediment on the bottom. I gently tipped the bottle and noticed quite a bit of suspended cloudy stuff that I disturbed during tipping. 

So, my questions:
Is this cloudy stuff bad? It was staying at the bottom until I disturbed it.
How soon is too soon to rack again?
Should I add a campden Tablet?
At this point would it be stupid to add actual wine yeast in a few days if I ordered some?
Also any other advice is welcome! 

I want to say again I am doing this for fun and if it goes poorly that‚Äôs ok, I am having fun either way. I do want to save it if possible though!",winemaking

"Secondary fermenter headspace First time trying my hand at wine. Just realised I may have a problem on my hands.

Have 13l of peach wine currently fermenting in a 25l glass carboy. No problem as the fermentation is going strong so there's plenty of CO2 around.

My problem comes up when I have to transfer to secondary. As a beer brewer I've always just bottled straight from primary after cold crashing so I've never had to consider secondary before.

I only have 25l or large vessels that are suitable for secondary. Two 25l glass carboys, a 25l plastic bucket, and a 30l plastic tank fermenter (which currently has an IPA in it, almost time to bottle). So I will have a major issue with too much headspace and I'm worried about oxidisation and spoiling. 

Luckily primary has only just kicked off so I have a little time on my hands to think this through.

Ideally I'd like to rush off and buy myself a smaller vessel, but sadly we're in lockdown so that ain't gonna happen.

I think my options are:
1. Rack it to the other glass carboy after 7-10 days and hope for the best.
2. Rack it slightly earlier so that there is a bit more fermentation going on and hope it fills the headspace with CO2. 
3. Rack it after 7 - 10 days and chuck a little more sugar in to kick off another mini fermentation and hope it fills the headspace with CO2.
4. Add a load more sugar and water to it now so that the headspace is less of an issue and then do any of 1 - 3 above to deal with the (greatly reduced) headspace issue when I do rack.
5. Just chuck in lots more sugar now to make the ABV higher than I'd like and then dilute with water when I rack to fill up the headspace.
6. Do a little bit of 4 &amp; 5.
7. Bottle the IPA in the larger fermenter a bit earlier than I'd like and then transfer the 13l that's currently fermenting to it and add enough sugar and water so as to make enough to fill the headspace when I rack to secondary.

"Any Italian winemakers care to throw some advice my way? So here goes!  This year I was able to get my hands on 5 gallons each of some Italian varietals for the first time, Montepulciano and Aglianico.  I did some homework on these and found the basics: Monte is a table red similar to a Sangiovese, and Aglianico is a big red that does well with long aging (5+ years in the barrel).

Both were picked &amp; pressed in September and have been sitting happily in a pair of 5gal Hungarian oak barrels I have.  I racked them once each in around Nov/Dec, and used the Monte to top off the Aglianico.  I topped the Monte off with some Cab that I had from the previous year.  Both taste fine, but both (expectedly) are a bit green.  But their flavor profiles have switched.  The Monte is still a brighter red to look at, and the Aglianico a deep blood-red, but I'm liking the taste of the Monte better right now.

Back-story time.  When I got the grapes, my name was called for the Monte when the bin was nearly empty.  My grapes were very sludgy and I had a metric fuck-ton of seeds to deal with. Racking this wine caused my pump's in-line filter to clog 4 times just with 5 gallons.  The taste was very sharp and gritty initially, with little complexity or finish.  Contrast that with the Aglianico which tasted like it could go straight from the press to the bottle.  Even the juice from the grape off the vine had complexity front and back and a bright taste all the way thru.  My name was called first for these so I had nothing but perfect bunches of grapes off the top of the bin, no sludge at all.

So I guess my question is should I keep doing what I've been doing and let these wines sit or should I give in to my urge to tinker with them because I have too much time on my hands thanks to quarantine?

TLDR: I have 2 wines that have swapped palette profiles in the 7 months since they were pressed, should I do anything about that?",winemaking

"What size vineyard is needed to make a living and support a family? I've always wanted to have a vineyard, but the thought of managing a huge company with a bunch of employees puts me off. My wife and I don't have kids yet, but we're hoping to have a few kids soon and put them to work on a family farm. My hope is to make wine on my own property for a profit, selling locally, but on a small enough scale that I am still able to enjoy time with my family. Is this possible? If it's possible, would money be tight? I realize that what I've written below are fairly general questions and the answers could be influenced by quite a few details, but here are my original questions as well as a few more things I have been wondering about, written out a bit more neatly. Lastly - I realize my goal is to start a business, and that I will probably need to hire some employees. That's fine. My intent is to keep the scale small enough so that I'm not spending all my damn time working. I want to invest time into my family and community.

* What size vineyard is needed to make a living and support a family? Do we need to plant 5 acres? 10?
* Is it possible to sell locally only, and not worry about contracts with large liquor and wine companies to get my product distributed all over the country?
* Is there a major difference in profit in selling grapes vs selling wine I've made myself?
* Is there a major difference in profit between having a tasting room and not having one? Considering fixed operational costs and employee wages/salaries, I felt like this could be a major time and money hole, but I could also see it being very profitable. I guess there are a lot of variables.
* If it's not possible, would it be feasible to supplement income with some other type of agricultural product (apples, milk from cows, crops, honey, or mead made from honey, etc) on a manageable scale?

I understand I might not get straight answers on these questions; that's alright. If anyone knows of resources I can look at, I'd be just as happy with a reference. Thanks everyone!",winemaking

"First wine batch (at home, 4wk kit), a couple questions First I'm moderately experienced working with beer (concentrate kit and whole grain) and Cider, but am new to wine making.

I started this batch of wine 13 days ago.  The directions say it should be ready for secondary tomorrow and at/below 0.997g. One is supposed to add a stabilizer at this point. However, it's still bubbling every 20 seconds or so thru the airlock.   The fermenting area sits around 17 or 18c temperature (63-65f), so I expect it's just being slower than normal.   


A few kit details:

* 4wk kit, Reisling style, I'll likely back sweeten it a bit.
* bentonite clay goes in with the must
* Starting gravity was 1.100 (does the bentonite raise the specific gravity enough to matter?)
* Yeast is Lalvin EC-1118, fermentation was vigorous for the first week and a bit, now it's slowing.

Three questions:

1. How much longer do you think it'll need due to the lower fermentation temp (It's well within EC-1118's preferred range, so I'm not overly worried)
2. How much (if it's even measurable) does the Bentonite clay affect the SG reading?
3. If the hole size is about right, can one cork a screw top bottle?  My LHBS is closed and I cannot buy bottles as planned.  I have a big corker meant to screw onto the workbench (Hey, I got it for free)

"Blackberry wine not fermenting - help? Hi all!

So I've pitched my yeast into my must a couple of days ago and it doesn't look like anything is happening - I was hoping that the brains trust here can help me troubleshoot and save this wine.

Here's the process I've followed so far:

1. Cleaned out my [fermenting pail](https://www.grainandgrape.com.au/products/category/search/7PAIL%2025L%20WITH%20LID--pail-white-plastic-25-litre-with-lid),
2. Emptied my frozen bwild blackberries into the pail, along with approximately 3-5 litres of water (to assist in thawing).
3. Added three crushed campden tablets, along with approximately one teaspoon of [Pectinase](https://www.grainandgrape.com.au/products/category/search/8ENZYME%20PECTINASE%2050G--enzyme-novoclair-speed-pectinase-50g).
4. Waited approximately 24 hours, then sprayed some sanitiser around the inside walls of the pail.
5. Rehydrated Lalvin EC-1118 as per packet instructions, then pitched yeast, mixed it up, and sealed with an airlock.

I pitched the yeast about 3 days ago, and have seen no bubbling since. It's been a bit cold here in Melbourne recently, so I've had the heater on as much as possible - internal air temps have been around 18-23 degrees celcius since pitching the years, though today has been much warmer (around 27).

I'm still very much a beginner, so I don't really have any fancy gear, and the pail has just been sitting out in the laundry where it's fairly dark.

"Wine Making Advice.  So I started homebrewing about a year ago. (Mostly Wine) and most of my attempts have done ok. But I would like to do better. 75% to 80% of my fermentations go alright. But sometimes they seem to stall. My last 2 brews turned out alright. I usually don't use heating pads or belts because fermenting at room temperature usually worked well for me. It sometimes took a couple of weeks maybe longer but it worked. So recently I heard a roomer that if you do use a heating pad and/or belt that the fermentation will go faster so I bought one.

I usually use distillers yeast to make my wine because the manufacturer says it can get up to 22% alcohol content and I like that because I prefer a high alcohol wine. So about a week ago I started a blueberry wine fermentation. I decide to use the heating pad I bought this time because I heard I could fully ferment my wine in 4-5 days. (Not counting Secondary Fermentation).

The only issue is when I tried to ferment the product with the distiller's yeast it stopped creating alcohol after about 5 days at around 13% when the target was set for 18%.

Now it has been 3 days later and fermentation has completely stopped.

I was hoping someone could read the fermentation procedure that I use all the time with fruit wines and maybe help me figure out what is going on with my blueberry wine fermentation and how to fix it.

I would also like the help of perfecting my wine fermentation procedure so 90% of my brewing will go right instead of just 75% to 80% of them.

Here is my usual winemaking procedure as follows: (I use this procedure with (Most) other fruits).

1. I sanitized EVERYTHING that was going to touch the mixture with Star San.
2. I added 8lbs of wild blueberries to a 2-gallon sanitized fermentation bucket, crushed them up with a potato masher and sterilized them with a Camden tablet for 24 hours.
3. The next day I filtered about 20 cups of tap water through a Brita filter to remove as much chlorine as I could.
4. I poured 15 cups of the filtered water in with the crushed blueberries then added enough sugar to give me about a 13% Potential alcohol reading on my hydrometer.
5. 13% was my usual fermentation target so I added just enough sugar to pump it up to 18% potential alcohol just for the hell of it and stirred the living crap out of it.
6. I weighed out about 6 to 8 grams of yeast (Give or take) (I always do double what is recommended by the manufacturer to try and overpopulate bacteria that (may) have a chance of getting in the fermenter for any reason).
7. Then I add about 3 teaspoons of Fermax Yeast Nutrient along with 1 teaspoon of Yeast Energizer.
8. I fit the airlock onto the gasket on the lid followed by adding the sanitizer water and close everything up and wait for fermentation to start.

After about 5 days on the heating pad at a temperature of about 85-90 F (The entire 5 days) (Controlled with a thermostat), I got an abv of 13% but by this time the bubbles were starting to fade.

Now it's 3 or 4 days later and the fermentation has come to a halt and the hydrometer is reading the same 13% reading. I pitched more yeast along with yeast nutrient but I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do.

It had started fermenting again earlier today but I have no clue if I lowered the quality of my wine or not by re-pitching yeast and nutrients.

So if anyone could give me some advice to help me find out why the fermentation is stalling that would be appreciated. Also, some advice on improving my fermentation method would help as well.",winemaking
"Wine flavor problem.  Hi, everyone. I am having a little trouble with the flavor profile of the wine I make at home. I have been homebrewing for about a year now and still haven't gotten quite what I like yet. I've made some decent wine but I've been trying to figure out why I'm lacking flavor in each one.

When I make (fruit wine) I will usually use frozen fruit that I unthaw from the grocery store. I usually make around a 2-gallon batch so I use 4lbs per gallon and that usually adds up to about 8lbs of frozen fruit. I also shoot for an alcohol content of around 12% to 13% most times.

I do the usual procedures... Sanitise all the equipment that touches the wine mixture, use Camden tablets, etc... wait 24 hours then add sugar and the chemicals (Wine Yeast, Yeast Nutrient, Yeast Energizer, and Tannins) Then I add just a tiny bit of citric acid.

After the fermentation is over I get a very musty co2 smell along with a strong alcoholic wine-like smell but that's all I get. It's like the flavor of the fruit was either hidden or destroyed and this happens almost every time. I don't usually age my wine very long only a couple of weeks. I'm sure it would help if I aged it longer.

When I taste the wines I make it's usually very harsh with an alcoholic bite. You taste (some) fruit but more wine flavor than anything.

How do I fix this? Is my procedure off? Or do I just need to age longer or something?

Is there any advice anyone can give me to make the wine taste like the fruit and not just wine?",winemaking

"Can someone explain what ultimately happens to yeast after wine making? I understand that when the alcohol content gets too high, there is no sugar left, or certain chemicals are added, alcohol production ceases because the yeast can no longer ferment, but what actually happens to the yeast?

Whether alive or dead, are the yeast filtered out at some point? Or are they still in the bottle when you buy it?

My understanding is that in beer making, the yeast mostly survives, and can be filtered out and repitched to start the next batch. Is there an equivalent for winemaking?

"DM me ur Concord vines Hi there r/winemaking, we recently released Episode 1 of our webseries about American wine history, [Driven To Drink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOGI6D5DjA). We're trying to encourage people to think outside the tasting note, and connect with the stories and sacrifices that are behind their bottles.

We're working on an episode about the really amazing story behind the Concord grape. I work in a European-focused wine shop myself, and can say that unfortunately a lot of the people who would most appreciate the story are also the most closed off to it. So we gotta make a clear case to these folks early on for why they should care.

I believe there are many reasons to care about miraculous little Concord, and nobody says you have to drink and like a bottle of Manishewitz to appreciate its importance. Among these reasons is its importance to the American home grapegrower and home winemaker, who do all sorts of creative things with the grape with no expectation of commercial reward. So if you have a Concord vine in your backyard that you love, we want to use you as a visual while we make that case! DM me a photo of you standing next to your vine, and we'll give you a shoutout in the credits. We'd love to show your vine off!

"I messed up and added dry yeast nutrients to the must! So, the current pandemic and the likelihood of a longer period of self isolation has gotten me into homebrewing/wine making. I figured that I needed a new hobby and something to focus on. I'm also probably gonna need drinks to calm my nerves when people start dropping like flies out there. 

I've got a batch of organic apple and ginger wine (juice concentrate and powdered ginger) fermenting (it smells lovelyü§§), and being a novice, I just realized I messed up and need some advice from you experienced wine makers!

I added the yeast nutrients (wyeast nutrient blend) to the must without hydrating itüòû. I noticed that it didn't dissolve well, and I wonder if I should add another dose of nutrients dissolved in a small amount of must, or if that could compromise the flavor/aroma?

What would you do?

"Making Cider and White Grape Wine Sweetened With Concentrate So I'm working on some wine and cider made from some Walmart Store Brand apple and white grape juice, and instead of sugar, I'm using concentrate to sweeten it, and I'm using Red Star Cuvee yeast. The results taste rather promising. I used two large 3/4 gallon jugs of juice for each type mixed with three cans of concentrate, and white grape juice concentrate is hard to find in my area so I bought it at Winco. So far, the taste is very intense - moreso than when I use brown sugar.

So far my wines have been rather ros√©/zinfandel-ish though I'm working toward more dry wines. What would you suggest? If you use store-bought juice to make wine, how do you raise the brix? Usually I use maybe 2/3 of a box of brown sugar per jug, but I wanted to put the California restriction on myself this time around.

2.  We h ave done away with having crackers on the counter, as well as leaving pens/pencils out.  They are available if patrons ask for them.

3.  Hand sanitizer dispensers and facial tissue are readily accessible to patrons and staff.

4.  As frequently as possible, staff are asked to wipe down the counter top, door handles, and other touch points.

5.  Staff are asked to wash their hands after handling credit cards and particularly after handling cash.

6.  Hand washing the glasses of a sick person could expose staff.  Staff are asked to use latex gloves during the hand washing process, then throwing the gloves away.

7.  The tablet screens we use as our POS are recognized as a potential point of contagion since so many people handle them.  Excessively disinfecting them may ultimately damage the surface.  Customers and staff are encouraged to sanitize before and after using them.

Long time homebrew.. wine making racking? I've brewed beer for about 10 years and want to get my brother a wine making set up for his 30th birthday. I have some things I don't use much including and 6.5 and 5 gallon carboy that I would add to what I buy. I'm trying to research the process so I can set him up for success. Is it standard process to rack 4+ times with wine making? Would having only one  5 gallon carboy make things obnoxious? I assume once primary was done in the 6.5 then transferred to the 5 gallon you wouldn't want to transfer back to the 6.5 because of head space. Secondary fermentation is rarely done with beer making but I know wine making is not apples to apples and having an extra 5 gallon carboy may be more important.,winemaking

"Does this look infected? Hi all,  

So I've recently pulled out a couple of leftover [bottles of liquorice wine I made last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/akgnub/liquorice_wine_update/) and they're looking a bit funky. I'm not sure if this just needs a much better racking procedure next time or if I'm harboring some new life forms I shouldn't be.  

The bottles have been corked and in a wine rack for a while, unopened, but the corks are pushed in by hand rather than machine so I'm not sure how tight they really are. They used to be all-brown but this one now has a weird black line running through it. One of the bottles actually had a bit of fur on the outside, but I couldn't see if it'd wormed its way in!  

The worrying part is the hefty amount of blackish brown crud that's taken residence. When I originally racked this wine it was only a standard affair of light brownish dusty stuff. As the bottles have been laying down rather than stood upright, I put this one upright to see if the crud would settle.  

What d'you reckon? Safe to drink still? I've got lots of spare bottles I can siphon it into but I'll gain some headspace, or I've got a spare mini-keg I can dump them all into if needed!

"I have a few questions about first-time winemaking My house has a few grape vines growing in the backyard and I was able to harvest a small amount of purple wine grapes (2-3 shopping bags) and a larger amount of table grapes (white and purple). 
I'm not able to process them further for a while so I've put them all in the freezer. 

My questions are:

1. How scrupulous do I need to clean/pick through them? I've already gone over them fairly well, picking out any old/dried grapes, but have left them on the stems for now. I have campden tablets but I didn't know if I had to be utterly scrupulous in picking out bad grapes or just do it fairly well.

2.  I plan to make grappa from the table grapes, so from reading I thought I would make a small batch of wine with the wine grapes, mash and press, and then mash the table grapes and ferment them with the pressed material from the wine grapes and then distill. Is that correct?

3. Finally how long does it take for grape vines to become fruit bearing? I have been able to grow cuttings by submerging vine runners in soil to grow roots and then transplanting them - how long will they take to bear fruit, and is there any way I can help speed their growth?",winemaking
"Questions about bottling cold crashing and pasteurization. So I just finished bottling a wine I had cold crashed for a week to get all the sediment at the bottom. However I realized after I finished corking them that there might be some problems storing the bottles at room temperature because I bottled while it was still cold. It's only the second wine I have made and I made some begginer mistakes that lead to it being very sweet (1.08 FG) and low ABV. (More info at the end)

My question is:
Is it safe to store these bottles at room temperature? I bottled straight out of the fridge and while I'm sure I kept the majority of the yeast out, I'm unsure whether or not it is safe to leave the wine at room temperature in case any yeast warm up and become active again. I only left about half an inch between the bottom of the cork and the wine when I bottled so I'm not exactly sure how much the yeast could actually start to ferment again with that little oxygen.

On another note, could I kill the yeast by pasteurizing the bottles in hot water (150 degrees for 10 minutes) safely due to the difference in temperature (the wine was racked straight out of cold crashing so it is fairly cold)?

I'm not exactly sure where to go from here or how to ensure the yeast don't start fermenting again without storing in the fridge. I would like to age at room temperature if possible. Is it safe to do either of the things I mentioned about without a risk of exploding bottles?

"MALOLACTIC FERMENTATION - is it to late after few months Hello,  
I'm making my first wine from polish grapes after really hot summer. Those grapes were industrial and had a big seed and thick skin. Fruits were pretty sour but judging by polish standards not too much.   
For fermentation I used S.cerevisiae bayanus 7 grams yeast. Sanitized everything with potassium sulfate and added about 1.5 grams of it to my 15 liter grape jucie. I've left skins and seeds to ferment in my plastic fermentor box for about 1.5 weeks. After that I've strained my juice out of seed and skins added about 2 kilograms of sugar (I don't trust polish grapes in terms of sugar) for higher alcohol content and left it to finish fermentation. I kind of forgot about it and here I am after about 4/5 months later.  
My wine is pretty sour and has strong alcoholic smell. It's pretty good tho after transferring wine must from plastic container to glass balloon.

"Questions regarding a wine made from syrup, possible pectin and splenda in it? The story:  
I'm a relatively new brewer,  and I largely make ciders and soda by the gallon, with my eye on moving into mead making. Soon I plan on moving up to a 8 gallon conical set up, but for now I just use glass carboys.  I have rarely made wines or beers, as I find pleasure in a dry, still apple cider.  Nothing complicated.   
I  had an empty 1 gal carboy after racking my cider and instead of using it to make a ginger ale or  'rude' beer like I usually do, I decided to make a wine . This was not a planned brew, just sort of an impulse on the day I racked the cider. My  base for the brew was a pint of chokecherry syrup that my grandma had made +  enough sugar to bring the OG up to 1.135, as well as just a tsp of almond extract for a light nutty note. The wort was, quite frankly, delicious.  I pitched a slightly expired champagne yeast, which went into action quickly and happily.  I did not take into consideration that my grandma may put pectin and artificial sweetener (almost certainly splenda, knowing my Gma) into her syrups, though I suspect that might be the case now.   


I pitched on Jan 28, its now March 2... so  tomorrow will be 5 weeks in primary fermentation. The shelf it ferments on sits at a fairly stable 70 degrees F, though it does get about 2 hours of sun exposure in the aftrernoon if I accidentally leave the curtains open in my brew room. There is still action going on and carbonation happening, and my gravity is down to 1.060, and the wine is still very sweet, cloudy and has a thick mouth feel.  I had been waiting to see action stop before taking a gravity reading, so this reading of 1.060 is my first reading.  It has a strange, rather chemically note to the nose but not of sulphur or like any spoilage. Not chlorine like, or acetone like, or vinegar like. I'm trying to put my finger on it, but I'm not sure what it is exactly. It could, in my mind, simply be a mash up of the almond, ethanol and artificial sweetners in a boquet I am just simply unaccostomed to.  
I haven't been able to get ahold of grandma for her syrup recipe yet, but once I do, it will shed some light on this for me.  I'm almost certain, though, that she has added pectin to the syrup as a thickener (Jelly and syrup get made on the same day in her kitchen.  I don't add pectin to my syrups, personally.)   


I've been doing some reading and have determined that adding pectin enzyme at this point would be BAD because it would drop all the pectin out into methanol and \*potentially\*  making it poisonous, while leaving the pectin in suspension will just keep it cloudy and thick to the mouth., but not poisonous.  My reading on artificial sweeteners added to wine has led me to a bit of a dead end, however, as most of what I have read refers to adding it as a back-sweetener.  I am concerned that there may be unwanted byproducts from fermenting on the artificial sweeteners.   


so my questions:  
1) Should I continue this wine, or pitch it  to the  gutter as a failed experiment with no real lessons learned?   
2) What do we know about fermenting on top of artificial sweeteners?  
3)  I am scared of methanol, someone hold me. What do I do?

"Stuck fermentation after temperature drop I started a fermenting a wine about a week ago and it was going really well. Lots of bubbling and activity. However last night the temperature in my apartment dropped to a really cold temperature and I woke up this morning and the fermentation seems to have stopped. My apartment has since returned to a normal temperature but fermentation hasn't started back up even though the must has returned to it's normal temperature. How can I restart the fermentation or did I just kill the wine and I have to restart?

"Apple - ginger - vanilla wine ?! Morning,

"How to rack off of fruit while keeping as much liquid as possible? I made a mead with a lot of fruit in primary fermentation and I am planning on adding more during aging.

"First batch extremely tart Hi everyone,

I want to start off by saying I have very little knowledge about winemaking.  I come from an extensive homebrewing background and when a family member called me and said he had 20 pounds of fresh grapes for me to experiment with, I couldn't say no to talking a shot at making my first batch of wine.  
After some light reading, I got the idea of how to make wine and just went at it.  Squeezed the juice, added yeast nutrient and yeast, fermented for about 2 months and then bottled.  I back sweetened half of the batch and left half as is.  

My first issue is that I didnt successfully kill the yeast in my back sweetened bottles, leading to sparking wine.  But I noticed something will all of the bottles regardless of back sweetening or not, they're all EXTREMELY tart.  They're not spoiled or soured (trust me, I've had my fair share of homebrew batches go bad).  Every bottle I've tried seems to be very tart and acidic.  

Can anyone provide a novice winemaker some clarity as to why this happened and how to prevent it next year?",winemaking
"Dry Vitis Labrusca and other New World Wines I am a relatively new wine drinker (2-3 years now), and I‚Äôve been doing more tasting at local wineries here in the mid-Atlantic. I have noticed that many Vitis Labrusca wines (concord, niagara, etc.) and other wines (Riesling, etc.) are often fermented to sweetness rather than dryness. Is there a reason for that? Same with fruit wines. 

I happen to like the foxy flavor, and I am hoping to try my hand at winemaking (brewing background), but I also like dry and off-dry wines much more than sweeter ones. Would a dry Concord grape wine be awful? What if it was fermented with wild yeast or a full-bodied, spicy yeast (like Red Star Premier Rouge)?",winemaking

"A question about N2O and wine I admit this is a strange question.

I make clarified milk punches as a hobby. Milk punches are cocktails clarified through milk curdling. By curdling milk with an acidic, and then straining the drink back through the curds, you can achieve crystal-clear drinks. The casein curds act as a filter, catching all the particles and compounds that defract light in a cocktail. The curds also bond with the enzymes in citrus juices that create bitter-tasting limonoids, meaning that the finished cocktail is shelf-stable and can be stored for years just like wine.

Many milk punches use bases of port or even red wine. I develop new recipes based on existing cocktails and fit them into my milk punch template so I can bottle them and store them. Most recently I thought it would be fun to turn a Kalimotxo (a casual Spanish drink of equal parts red wine and Coca-Cola) into a milk punch. I used all-natural root beer, red wine, port, armagnac, lemon juice, overproof rum, and black tea. The filtration worked; it's crystal clear. It's a little thinner in the mouthfeel than most milk punches I make, because usually they're higher ABV and contain liqueurs, and that thickens them up. This one is about 14% and no liqueur added. So to compensate for this thin mouthfeel, I'd like to keg the drink in a cold-brew system and gas it with nitrogen or nitrous oxide (N2O).

I know nitrogen would be inert in reaction to everything in the drink, but I know nitrous oxide would give me a beautiful creamy head because of the dairy fats and surfactant proteins that are still in the finished drink.

But will the nitrous oxide oxidize the wine base of my drink? 

Thank you for your help.",winemaking

"Airlock activity: How slow is slow enough to be considered at the end of fermentation so we can rack? We're making a 5 gallon batch of blueberry wine for the 4th time. We used 15lbs of frozen then blended berries, 12 lbs of sugar, all the other good stuff and a package of EC-1118 yeast. Fermentation has slowed down to a bubble every 45-50 seconds 19 days after fermentation became active, 21 days after we started the batch.

Is there a point where slow enough is good enough or must there be no fermentation activity? We've always erred on the side of caution and let is sit at least 2-5 days with no or near zero bubbling activity 1) to make sure the process has stopped and 2) so we can rack on a weekend when we have time to enjoy the process. We have had generally good wine outcomes but there was one time we let is sit well over a month beyond the end of fermentation bc we didn't make time to rack and it seemed to make the wine come out ""heavier"" as my wife describes it so we don't want to go to there again. This time we want a ""lighter"", drier wine so we want to time racking more closely to ""the perfect time"" and will also be reducing the amount of back sweetening to 1 - 2 cups of dissolved sugar for the batch before bottling.

Does letting it sit in the fermenter for a longer period after fermentation stops help, hurt or makes no difference to the final outcome? We're looking to fine tune the process for a more consistent outcome.

Another reason we want to get to the racking phase without waiting extra, unnecessary days is so we can get a fresh batch started. We have some spring/summer events coming up for which we'd like to have a good supply of wine but definitely don't want to ruin anything by hurrying.",winemaking

"Finnish sugar wine recipe This is the most basic alcohol recipe. It will yield you around 3 liters or 0.8 gallons. I‚Äôve heard it is popular in the Finnish punk rock scene.
This is based of a recipe I got from the daily nexus I think.

Equipment/ ingredients
3.5 cups of pure cane sugar
Packet of yeast
Gallon milk or water jug
Tap water
Balloon

Optional: 
Filter
Funnel

steps:
1.  Put the sugar and yeast into the gallon jug

2. Add water up until about 2 inches from the top.

3. Screw on the cap and shake.

4. Take off the cap and put a balloon over the cap with a hole in it.

5. Let it ferment for around 2 weeks. If you wanted it carbonated, screw on the cap after 2 weeks but be weary it may ‚Äúexplode‚Äù.

6. (Optional). You want to filter it so you don‚Äôt have the yeast in the final product. Just filter it through something like a coffee filter of thin piece of cloth. Either will do the trick.

Notes:
Adding small amounts of sugar throughout the fermentation process will increase its ABV. 

The balloon is to keep oxygen out so the yeast anaerobically respirates. If you do this wrong it can result in your just making some vinegar.

From what I‚Äôve heard the ABV is around 15-20% 
depending on if you add sugar during the fermentation and what yeast you use.  

The taste is not very good so if you‚Äôre looking for a good tasting alcohol this is not the recipe.

"Experienced home brewer looking for an evaluation of my first wine process Hey all,

I‚Äôm going to start my first wine kit after a few years of home brewing. I‚Äôd just like to make sure I‚Äôm thinking about things correctly. 

I‚Äôm using the Cellar Craft old vine Zinfandel kit FYI. I believe it is 18L of juice and skins. 

1. I‚Äôm thinking about using my spike flex 7 gallon stainless fermenter for primary. It suggests a 7.9 gallon fermenter. Will this be a problem?

2. I will then rack to a 5 gallon carboy for secondary whenever it is ready. At this point I know your wisdom outranks the wine kit instructions. Should I leave it in the secondary for a few weeks and then rack to another carboy to age? Should I leave it in secondary for a few months and then rack to age? I‚Äôm unsure about the post primary to bottling process and what is considered best practice. 

3. When should I use an airlock after primary? When should I use a bung? As far as using an airlock, it will be with my brew stuff so I‚Äôll be able to monitor the water level often enough that it won‚Äôt go dry. 

4. I keep seeing a sulphate solution for sanitizing. Can I just use star San or is there a reason they all suggest using this? 

I guess my main concerns won‚Äôt creep up for another few weeks. I‚Äôll be starting fermentation this week and then doing the first rack to secondary.....whenever it is best I suppose. Should I wait for terminal gravity in primary if I am planning on aging it for around a year or rack to secondary with some points to spare?

Rather, I'm talking about the process outlined in this link: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1271/bbb.65.1596](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1271/bbb.65.1596)   


Now I'm not very good at reading papers like these, and from what I can tell the primary point of their experiments were to check concentrations of chemicals with health benefits, but I'm more interested in the fact that, apparently, mushrooms can function in place of proper wine yeast. It's very interesting to me as I am a hopeful mushroom farmer and I'm looking for potential products to process excess crop into. In fact, it's so interesting that I'm considering it in-spite of my complete inexperience with wine.  


The thing is, I can't find much information on it, anywhere. Including this subreddit or subreddits specifically dealing with mushrooms or mushroom products. As far as I can tell, like five other people have considered this on a single topic in an obscure and defunct forum about homebrewing. Because of this, I imagine that no one here is going to be able to walk me through a process, so instead I'll be figuring that stuff out on my own.  


The reason I made this post was to ask several specific questions of which I am finding it very difficult to answer.  


1. What is the startup cost of a winery that does not use grapes? Everything I can find on the internet starts off with stuff about how expensive the land is, and I have no idea what parts of their expenses include land/grape associated costs, so combing that out from the data has proven difficult.  

2. If I just wanted to ferment some sugar water in a bucket, how would the ratio of sugar to yeast and the absolute amounts of both affect the resulting sugar-water ""wine""? Mushrooms don't have a lot of carbohydrates, so I will have to add basically all the sugar myself. I have no idea how much mushroom I should add comparative to how much sugar, but that's not something I can imagine anyone answering. Instead I'll just be adding different amounts of each and comparing the results to the aforementioned sugar water wine to get a sort of idea.  

3. How long would such a concoction actually take to reach 'maturity', since the flavor doesn't really have to seep in gradually from a barrel or wood chips or grapes or what have you? Of course, the time will be different with mushrooms, but having a baseline to know when the mushrooms are changing the flavor and the mixture is actually fermented would be helpful.  

4. If you were at a grocery store or had the opportunity to try such a wine at some kind of meetup, would you do so? This is not an offer, but rather a survey for actual wine drinkers. I need to know how much of a market I can expect, and basically the only thing I can really do is ask people.  


As you can see, these questions are very specific to very niche circumstances, so finding answers on my own would be difficult to impossible. Nobody is going around making flavorless sugar water wine except in maybe some kind of laboratory, and there's not really a such thing as a winery with no way to source grapes, except for those 'vineyard-less' labels that basically just do everything for you, and that's way on the other end of the scale.  


I'm mostly interested in this because of the degree of control I can have over mushrooms compared to grapes. Grape flavored wine depends on soil contents, climate, the exact type of grape, etc, which is all dependent on where you grow them, but my mushrooms will be grown inside a controlled environment and will have little genetic drift between crops. I can control humidity, heat, oxygen, the substrate they are grown on, etc, so I can get the same exact flavor every single time. Also you can grow like a hundred pounds a week in less than a hundred square feet of space, so my 'vineyard' can be anywhere I want it to be.  


If I'm correct, then this would reduce cost dramatically, as despite the costs of mushrooms per pound (Oysters are about $10-15 a pound fresh) a vineyard still sounds dramatically more expensive. Theoretically, I could make a rather high quality wine for a relatively low cost (I sincerely doubt I can out compete two buck chuck so cheap wine isn't an option, and mushrooms won't have the prestige to make it in the dramatically expensive price range).  


Anyway, I need to actually crunch those numbers later, and really I can't be certain until I do so, but even if it doesn't turn out to be a viable business, I'm still gonna make some mushroom wine. I got a chef friend whose really interested in checking the flavor it adds when cooking...  


As far as the other questions about wine making, that info is plentiful enough. That being said, the process may turn out to be an entirely different beast than I first thought, so it will necessitate experimentation. But that's fun part right?",winemaking
"Persimmon Wine - Salvageable? At the end of the persimmon season I had a couple dozen pounds of persimmons. I knew we couldn't eat them fast enough so I decided to make persimmon wine with them.  I'm more of a homebrewer and this is my first time attempting a wine.

I screwed up my hydrometer reading because the added sugar wasn't homogenous in the bucket after adding it and I ended up adding too much.  When I racked it to the secondary, there was a bunch of sugar just sitting at the bottom. 

When I tasted it at 2 weeks, it was absolutely awful. It tasted super boozy and really sulfurous.  I gave it more time to finish fermenting since I was still seeing some yeast activity. 

After a couple more weeks, I degassed it and moved it to another container.  Still tasted pretty bad. 

I let it rest another 4 weeks or so, and it was still pretty awful and sulfurous.  I didn't get around to pouring it out, and it's been about another 4 weeks.  I figured I would pour it out today, but I wanted to taste it first and it turns out that it is significantly less awful. The booziness seems much more balanced, I can get some of the sweetness coming through, but there's still a little bit of sulfurous flavor coming through. 

If I continue to let it rest, can I expect the sulfurous flavors to diminish further?  I degassed it again today in case that's what had helped. Anything else I ought to do?  Should I bottle it and let it rest awhile or wait first?

I originally thought the experiment was a total disaster, but it seems like it might be possible to recover now.",winemaking

"Slow fermentation Making a peach wine out of juice to give the hobby a try. Read up a bit on very simple recipes for fruit juice wine.

"1 Gallon Batch - First Timer Goes Au Natural Hey all, couples of quick questions regarding general process for an as natural wine as possible.

I‚Äôve never made wine before and last week I had a natural wine that blew my mind. I do t expect anything I make to be that good, but it would be fun to throw some fruit in a bucket and see what happens.

If I want to make a gallon of wine from fruits I can get at the supermarket, how much will I need and is it essential to add water to reach final volume? I read some conflicting reports and recipes, and was hoping for some clarification. Some said 3-5lbs for a gallon of wine, but surely that doesn‚Äôt give enough liquid?

Speaking of fruits, I get that I should find the best fruits I can, and I was thinking to get grapes and/or mix it with some berries. Is there any thing you‚Äôd specifically avoid? 

Last one: for natural fermentation, will it work with supermarket fruits if they‚Äôve been washed? Or will yeast be essential? If I can avoid tabbing Campden Tablets and yeast that‚Äôd be nice, but if it is generally accepted that the wine would be shit without it, I‚Äôm happy to try.

1. How much should I actually use of dried elderflower in a recipe for a gallon?
2. How does the recipe change if the dried elderflower is from a loose leaf tea, compared to pure dried elderflower (for reference this is what I have on hand: [Elderflower Herbal Tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJZCCMW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1))

"2nd year of Winemaking Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I started making wine in 2018 with my friend. We only made two batches of Merlot, the first one was made in 2018, and we bought around 300 kilos of Merlot, made the ""selection"" of all grapes individually (everything is easier when friends are there), and we received around 90 liters of lovely wine. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2019 we raised the cap to 500kg, but we ended with bringing back around 600kg (it was a very good year with sugars in grapes around 25% shown on Refractometer). 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem started when we noticed that we needed one more barrel to store the extra wine because the 200-liter barrel from 2018 was not enough. So we went to a local INOX producer and bought a smaller one with a 140-liter capacity to fill it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to get to the point...

&amp;#x200B;

I went one day to check the progress and noticed something that looks like rust, in small circles around the rim and some dots on the ""floating cap"", i will show in pictures. I immediately cleared every dot with paper and scratched it a bit to get it off. Then i contacted a friend of mine who is making wine also, and he told me that is because we put too much Potassium on the cap (we use it as a blocker for air), we did one bag of 10g, but after that, we used like 1-2 grams exchanging it every seven days. The dots stopped appearing, but there are some still left.

"Banana Brett Wine Tasting Notes This Homemade Backwoods Banana Brett Wine Recipe was a complete experiment and turned out to be one of the best fruit wines I have ever made. The banana comes through both on the nose and on the tongue. This is complimented by pineapple, a light 'breadyness' and vanilla. I added the oak chips without sanitizing them and I believe this introduced malolactic bacteria which gave the wine an amazing mouth feel, similar to a chardonnay. The Funky Brett character is not quite there yet but has added perhaps a little more acidity.

"Oxygen exposure while de-gassing I have a de-gassing drill attachment and while the kit directions say it should take 2-4 minutes at medium speed, even after 15 minutes it still seems like CO2 is coming out of solution. 

Is the idea to agitate the wine to release all of the CO2 in one go, or to release a large chunk of it, with the idea being the rest will release soon after on its own? 

How much of a risk is oxygen exposure at this point? This is 14 days into fermentation, near the FG target. I'm planning to age the wine for 6-12 months minimum so will be adding metabisulphites. Does the metabisulphite quantity need to be adjusted based on oxygen exposure, pH, or some other measurable quantity? Is the thinking that by releasing CO2, there's a blanket of it between the wine and O2 so vigorous stirring isn't super risky, though one shouldn't splash or agitate more than is necessary?

Thanks in advance!",winemaking
"Problem with CO2 in the finished wine. What did I do wrong? I had a little problem with my last red wine. The taste is amazing but when I pour the wine in the glass we can notice a tiny ammount of gas and if we look closely we can see very tiny bubles in the wine. In the mouth the first thing that can be noted is a tiny peak of gas.
If we let the wine breath for some minutes this sensation gets less noticeable, but it stays there either way. 
What went wrong?

This wine was made inside Inox Vats and went directly to the bottle without going trough barrels. And that is why I am question the importance of barrels and amphoras because they allow micro-oxigenation, and Inox vats don¬¥t. Could it be that the problem?

"Efficient Natural Wine Fermentation Tricks? I am trying to understand how to bring the best efficiency to my wine fermentations. I deal with only wild yeasts and absolutely no additives.

"Pinot noir questions I‚Äôm attempting a batch of Pinot noir. Currently it has a lovely deep purplish red color and a nice sweet flavor. I have three questions that I would love feedback on. Sorry if they‚Äôre a bit newbyish. I‚Äôm pretty new to all this. The first has to do with fermentation.

1. Starting S.G. was 1.070. Fermentation stopped at 1.006. I added some water and yeast nutrient but nothing is happening. Do I need to get it in the 900s or can I call it good?

2. I noticed when I first drink it that it gives me a very slight headache. I‚Äôve read this can come from tannins in the grape skins. All the grapes were removed after primary fermentation and as of the last racking, there is no must at all. Is there anything I can do to counteract this?

"First racking / filtering ... siphoning and mechanical filtering ? On October 25 of 2019 we pressed our pinot noir off the skins and added the malo bacteria (and some malo food).  We filled the (small) headspace in our stainless bucket with co2 and sealed things shut.

A month or so ago I took samples and sent them to a lab and they said:

""Your pH is a little on the high side; however your Titratable Acidity (TA) is about normal.""

""The level of malic acid in your wine is 0 g/L, which means it has completed its fermentation and is considered dry. The secondary fermentation is when malolactic bacteria coverts malic acid to lactic acid. At this point, I would recommend racking your wine, making any acid adjustments and sulfuring it.""

""Yes, your wine is done with malolactic fermentation. As for your sulfur addition, I would recommend making a 50 ppm addition.""

&amp;#x200B;

So ... a little bit too basic (slightly high ph) but malo is finished, and we have close to 14% alcohol.

We're new to this so I am not going to get complicated with fiddling with the PH level and so on ... I just want to rack the wine, add the 50 ppm sulfur, and then close it back up in the oxygen-free stainless for another 6 months (?)

The questions are:

1. How do I move the wine from one stainless bucket (no spout/spigot) to another ?  I assume I need to siphon it, which I can do, I just wonder how to minimize oxygen content during the siphoning process ?

2. I'm not going to do the egg thing.  I assume a lot of solids are sitting at the bottom of our stainless bucket ... so as long as I don't siphon those up, can I just run the wine through a coffee filter and call it a day ?  I rather like the idea of using a mechanical filter to fine the wine rather than egg whites...

"Salvaging aged wine by fortifying it? I made a nothing special Bordeaux cabernet sauvignon from fresh juice about a year and a half ago.

I forgot to put sulfites in it so it's certainly oxidized a bit. 

Last time I sampled it it smelled very sweet and pleasant but the taste didn't match. Wasn't vinegar but wasn't as pleasant as it has been months earlier. The question is, can i/should I back-sweeten it to make it my palatable? Can I salvage it by turning it into a port at this stage by fortifying it?

"Chaptalization: sweet wine with low gravity? Hi folks.  I have been making wine for a few years now at home and so far haven't come across any major issues.  This latest batch however has been problematic, and happened to be my first time at chaptalization, so I was hoping someone could help point out where I went wrong.

I have two 5G batches of red: Montepulciano and Pinot Noir purchased as juice back in October.

**First the Monte:**

\- Started as 1.087 / 21 Brix / 11.3 potential ABV  
\- Added 1lb 11oz sugar to target &gt; 13 ABV  
\- Adding sugar resulted in 1.100 / 23.7 Brix / \~13.5 PABV

Kicked off primary (Lalvin RC212, 16% tolerance), and it quickly went down to 1.014.  Moved to secondary, and there it stayed for weeks with extremely slow progress.  Now here we are in January, and a measurement yesterday showed 0.097 / 13.5% ABV.  The wine while tastes great, yet is still pretty sweet to me.  I've never had a fermentation go below 0.096, and they've never tasted sweet like this one.  I usually like dry wines, and while I admittedly don't have a great palate, I convinced myself it was more fruity than sweet (though the wife disagreed with me), but went ahead and stabilized the wine.  My Dad likes sweeter wines anyway.

**As for the Pinot:**

\- Started at 1.088 / 21 Brix / 11.4 PABV  
\- Added 2 lb 13oz sugar to target &gt; 14 ABV  
\- Adding sugar resulted in 1.110 / 25.8 Brix / 14.3 PABV

Kicked off the primary with the same yeast, but here we are 11 weeks later and it's still hovering at 1.002, and not surprisingly, tasted very sweet.  I moved it to warmer part of the house and may try pitching a higher tolerance yeast and/or yeast energizer.  I'm going to hold off on stabilizing this one until I try a few more things.

So I know I likely had a slow/stuck fermentation in both cases, but in the case of the Montepulciano, the gravity now sits at 0.097, yet is fairly sweet.  Is this something that is normal when adding sugar?  Everything I've read up until now says &lt; 1.000 should be a dry wine. What FG should I be looking at for a dry wine then?  0.096 has typically been my ending point, and I always ferment in the same location in my house, where fermentations have always been done in roughly three weeks.",winemaking

There are some steps in the process I read about that seem weird, coming from a brewing background. Since they're from less-than-reputable recipe websites, I wanted to check to see if they are really necessary/correct steps, or if I can skip them. Could you please help me out?

1. During the initial 1 week fermentation (when fruit is still in the fermenter) they say to stir it every day. I thought this would be horrible to introduce oxygen at this time, and always potential for bugs.

2. After the 1 week initial ferment, it says to move to a secondary for 3 months or so, and then into another fermenter for another 3-6 months. Is there anything wrong with just leaving it in the same secondary? Again I don't want to needlessly introduce more oxygen or bugs. Or extra work... this seems really silly to me especially when it's off the main part of the yeast from the first week of fermenting.

3. Do you bother with gravity readings at the end of fermentation to make sure it is finished, or is it just going to be definitely 100% done after 6 months? (I assume the latter...)

4. How important is temperature during each step of fermentation? I *can* put fermenters in my beer fermenting fridge for the first week, but would rather not just because it's full of beer... after that I'd have to leave it in (Australian) room temps, between 15-25c usually.",winemaking

"Help finishing spiced pumpkin wine Help! I could use some ideas. I have a spiced pumpkin wine that I can‚Äôt seem to get below 1.018 gravity (1.122 OG). I mean it‚Äôs already at 13.65%, which is great, but it‚Äôs super sweet to taste still. Nice flavor, but very sweet. More than a dessert wine, which is not what I want. Definitely was hoping for something drier. I have two gallons each in a 1 gal carboy, racked twice so far. Starting to get decently clear, still some floaters. I‚Äôve hit it with nutrient twice in the past month, as well as nutrient at pitch. It‚Äôs 2 months old as of today. I used K1-V1116.

Everything I‚Äôve made in the last year has fermented dry within 3-4 weeks, if not sooner using both K1-V1116 and EC-1118. Temperature stays consistent at about 64 F. 

I‚Äôve brought these upstairs and wrapped in towel to try and warm them up a bit and see if I can wake some yeasties up. I don‚Äôt mind a little sweet with this, but I‚Äôd love to dry it out and get it closer to 1.000g. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, recipe was about 6 cups of sugar pumpkin, lots of brown sugar as fermentable base, cinnamon, nutmeg, fresh ginger, handful of raisins. 3 gallons at pitch, but the pumpkin left a lot of lees, and Ive lost 3/4 gallon just from racking. Did I lose most of the yeast from racking? Not much trub left as of now. Should I try to pitch some high tolerance yeast to try to finish it off?

"Primary Fermentation Advice Need some brainstorming help. I started a 5-gallon batch of blueberry wine on Friday. I followed the recipe to a T, added campden tablets Friday afternoon, and didn't add yeast until Saturday afternoon, over 24 hours later. By Sunday afternoon (another 24 hours), no fermentation had started. I read somewhere that air can help move things along, so I took the airlock out of the bucket lid to give it a bit of air flow while still protecting most of it.

Monday morning, still no signs of any fermentation. I figured maybe I had a bad batch of yeast, or my bucket maybe has more than 5 gallons of liquid and those packets are only good up to 5 gallons, or campden didn't have enough time to do its thing and killed the yeast, I don't know, so I added another packet (this time soaking it in warm water for several minutes before stirring it in).

"Fresh pressed juice only &amp; toss the pulp? So my awesome wife gave me a fruit press for Christmas.

"I'm allergic to red but not white wine. I read about tannins; but I'm curious from a chemical standpoint as to what compounds the skins add &amp; if anything else different (e.g. enzymes) are added in the making of red wine? *I've read several articles about allergens in wine, but not many of them distinguish between what's in red vs white. Not looking for medical advice (obvious advice is 'avoid red wine'). I just don't understand how fermenting with skins can impart compounds so different &amp; I'm curious as to how &amp; what those are.*

Red wine (and tawny port) makes me break out in hives on my thighs and shoulders; white wine (and white port) goes fine.

I thought the only difference between red wine and white wine was that red wine does the first round of fermentation with the skins on (?). **My question is what compounds the skins add to red wine, how are they imparted, and is there a difference in making red wine *besides* just using the skins? Like, are different things added in the processing?** 

- For example, how does the tannin get from the skins to the wine? Is it just like coffee or tea, ""if you soak grapes in water for long enough, tiny molecular pieces of the grape skins go into the wine""? But then, how is the wine clear? I read that pectin makes wine cloudy &amp; so adding pectic enzyme clears it up, but wouldn't clearing the wine require removing all the red molecular bits, too? 

- I read about anthocyanins, but don't really understand that; is it like tannins where it just kind of diffuses from the skins? How do anthocyanins &amp; tannins separate from the skin? 

- Are sulfites only in red wine and not white wine? Where do those come from?

- What else is there? What's added specifically to red?

- Do different grapes have different amounts of the compounds/chemicals? E.g. I think Malbec has much more tannin than Merlot. What about the other compounds/chemicals?

"pH measurement during primary fermentation: is your winery doing it? Love to hear thoughts!   


Over the past 2 years I have had conversations with over 100 wineries and winemakers about what attributes are important to measure in the primary fermentation process. Most attributes are widely agreed. Sugar being the most universal (although in different units and methods). Temperature being a no brainer. Some other interesting ones like volume, sulphur, CO2, oxygen‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääright through to a request to build an artificial nose! One of the measurements commands debate higher than others though, and that is pH. Measuring pH levels seems to be a divider in the winemaking community in terms of how useful it is or is not. Is your winery measuring pH daily in primary fermentation? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on why or why not‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähere is some thoughts I have compiled based on our conversations with winemakers.

A wines pH levels is an important thing to keep a close eye on during harvest and in the winemaking process. It greatly affects the flavor, ability to age, and overall balance of the wine. The pH levels in wines often differentiates a mediocre wine to a premium one.

Most wines fall between 3.2‚Äì3.6 on the pH scale. Grapes lose acid as the fruit ages on the vine, making it pertinent to pick the grapes when the pH, sugar levels, and tannins are at prime levels.

**Why is it important to track the pH levels daily?**

You want to track the pH daily, because the acidity levels impact every aspect of your wine. Flavor, aroma, color, carbon dioxide absorption, malolactic fermentation, ability to age, mouthfeel, and fermentation rate. It can also influence the chemical reaction after the fermentation process is complete.

Acidity levels should be monitored regularly throughout the grape growing process and then monitored on a daily basis as harvest gets nearer. These daily trackings should continue throughout the winemaking process.

Wines with too low of pH will be flabby, lacking mouthfeel and flavor. Wines that are too high in pH will be overwhelmingly tart, quicken the aging process, and may also affect the wines ability to go through malolactic fermentation which is sensitive to pH levels and SO¬≤ levels.

Having your wines in the correct pH ranges will also ward off bacteria and fungi growth, which can creep up during the winemaking process and create spoilage in the bottle.

**Daily tracking of the pH levels can allow you to moderate pH levels and adjust when needed, before any major problems arise.**

Tracking pH levels enables overall trends to be depicted. This is important as pH works on a logarithmic scale. This means small changes can have big impacts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääparticularly if the trend over time is showing the pH is heading in the wrong direction. For example, our research team examines the formation of some of the onion and chive flavor structures that form towards the end of fermentation as the pH drifts from 3.2 towards 4.

Many winemakers do not measure pH daily during primary fermentation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpreferring instead to take a measurement near the end of the fermentation and correct as and if needed. This is valid. Accurate pH measurements during primary fermentation are difficult and time consuming. There are often more important measurements that need to be done and only so many hours in the day. However, using pH data can offer a lot of insight into wine health and quality.

**pH and its influence on other important wine attributes**

Many of our customers walk us through their process of gathering data and making decisions during primary fermentation. A common practice is to use one attribute to gain many insights into the wine. Using pH to dig into deeper insights is also something winemakers are commonly doing.

For example, using a pH data point a winemaker can explore free and bound sulphur.

With real-time data on pH the winemaker can get insights on many important wine attributes. This is what makes pH levels a king-pin measurement for any winemaker.",winemaking

"New Winemaker -- Need Some Advice Hey All!
I am a beer homebrewer, now a winemaker! (sort of :P)

My wife got me a winemaking kit for Christmas. It's basically a box with pretty much all you need to start making wine. It also comes with pressed wine juice to jumpstart the process.

Is there any logical reason for this? Again, I come from the Beer world but I was under the impression that red wines need time to age? This wine, specifically, is a Merlot. Why on earth would they recommend that I drink the wine so young?

Does this have to do with the fact that I might not be equipped to properly age wine? I was under the impression that wine would be fine in the bottles for years. But based on what I read from the kit, it will not be.

I was thinking about keeping a bottle or two in storage to compare the change over time, but as I'm a novice I was wondering if anybody had more professional advice with this kind of wine. The guide I followed to make it suggested letting it sit in the bottle for ""just under a year,"" but also contained numerous errors in sanitizing technique and stuff like that so I'm not sure if I can trust it.  

Thank you in advance, I hope this isn't a dumb question.",winemaking

"Barrel Newbie Question I‚Äôve been making wine for many years but haven‚Äôt taken the plunge into barrels. I‚Äôm considering buying a 20 gallon French oak barrel from ReCoop in Sonoma. They plane down a 1/4 inch off the staves of a used barrel to create an essentially new wood surface for the wine to contact. I‚Äôm primarily interested in the micro oxygenation characteristics of barrels, not the tannins or the vanilla flavors that oak imparts.

In the first year I‚Äôd only use the barrel for three months to emulate 25% new wood. My question is how do I properly maintain the barrel during the nine months it‚Äôs out of service? Would I fill it with sulfited water? Thoughts?",winemaking

"Question about stuck fermentation So, I started a Peach/Plum wine about three months ago and have been going through all the steps of moving along a stuck fermentation. Being my first wine and having read a horrible book on the subject, I made a few mistakes on my first go. I did not take an initial gravity reading and I followed a recipe that didn't mention ever taking a gravity reading!

Anyway, I have a fruit wine now that is stuck at 1.020 and won't budge. I initially pitched the Red Star Pasteur Red yeast recommended by the recipe with the requisite sugar and pounds of fruit. The recipe is listed below for a 5 gallon batch:

\- 20lbs fruit

\- 7.5 lbs sugar

\- 5 cans of white grape juice

\- 5 campden tablet (for clearing according to the recipe)

I followed the recommendations of the recipe and pitched in the crushed campden tablets after the airlock stopped bubbling (I know, terrible advice). Anyway, after waiting another 3 weeks, I tried the wine and it was extremely sweet. By then, I had read a lot on brewing beer and wine, realizing the book/recipe I followed was not very good. I measured the FG and got a reading of 1.020. The wine is extremely sweet (even more than a desert wine I think, but I can taste the alcohol as well). Anyway, I was hoping to dry it out some more, but I can't seem to get the fermentation going again.

 I've tried the following remedies without success:

\- adding yeast nutrient (recommended by my local HBS)

\- changing fermentation temperature

\- pitching in a new batch of yeast (EC-1118)

I've tried everything that was recommended by Kraus and still can't seem to get this thing to finish. Any advice would be great, I'm thinking of making a starter with some EC-1118 or Red Star Blanc, and lowering the ferm temp to around to 70-75 to see if that might get things moving.",winemaking

"Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 3 Part 3:

It worked!

Here's a breakdown of the process since the last update:

&amp;#x200B;

11/25 - added LAB to the MLF batch.

11/29 - Took SG readings on both batches: Control - .996, MLF - 1.002

11/30 - Took SG readings on both batches: Control - .994, MLF - .996. 

I also took malic acid readings from both batches and was pleasantly surprised to see that MLF was working: Control - &gt;300 mg/l, MLF &lt;75 mg/l

&amp;#x200B;

12/2 - Took SG readings and racked into 3 gal. carboys: Control - .996, MLF - .993. 

Took malic acid readings: Control - &gt;300 mg/l, MLF - &lt;75 mg/l. 

At this point it seemed that the malic acid conversion was complete so I proceeded with following the kit instructions: Added k-meta, added kieselsol, stirred/degassed. 

The kit wanted me to add k-sorbate but I tossed that package.

&amp;#x200B;

12/3 - Took pH readings: Control - 3.39, MLF - 3.60

At this point we (my wife and I) tasted both batches and there is definitely a difference. The control batch was much more fruit forward and had more of an acidic bite to it. The MLF batch was slightly more bland which I guess is the flabby effect that people keep mentioning.

Even though the MLF batch pH was in an acceptable range, I went ahead and added 15g of tartaric acid to improve the taste.

Added chitosan, added 2oz. oak, stirred/degassed.

&amp;#x200B;

From here I plan to bulk age for about 2 months before bottling. I'll taste test the batches periodically to make sure the oak isn't too strong and give you all updates.

&amp;#x200B;

The picture is from the 12/2 malic acid test.

"I have begun the journey... Hello all! Im in Southern California and bought a property with four Cabernet Sauvignon vines. The previous owner had more but the vines died off. In the last month I have expanded to 21 vines total now... 15 cabs, 3 merlot, 1 catawba, 1 flame, 1 midgley (the last three were given to me). Im quite excited to see what I can do with all these. The four cab vines were growing wild and I was able to harvest 10 pounds total. I did test for brix at time of picking FWIW and got 20. No other testing was done.

So I made a 5 gallon batch on the weekend and honestly Im just guessing at it all first time around (I have made beer many times in the past). I would appreciate any input that might help this first batch turn out decent (as can be expected)...

- 1 can Alexanders Sun Country Pinot Noir concentrate
- water to bring it up to 2.5 gal
- 1 gallon welchs grape juice
- 1 gallon welchs red blend grape juice
- 10 pounds of my crushed cab grapes/juice
- 3 cups sugar

I know the welchs will turn people off but hey I just wanted to get to 5 gallons and at the time it made sense. It doesnt seem to make sense now. Im right around 5 gallons anyhow. Ive also added:

- 3 campden tablets
- 2 tsp acid blend

Unfortunately I have no way of testing pH or testing titratable acidity. Next batch I do (a kit or shipped grapes) I'll have everything ready to go. Until then Im working this first batch and with everything added above these are my readings:

- OG measures 1.080
- Brix is at 20.5

Tonight or tomorrow morning I'll be adding in the yeast nutrient and the yeast (4244 wyeast - Italian Red).

Okay... so what have I done wrong and what can I do to make sure this doesnt turn out too too bad. I am worried about the acidity level since I have no way of testing. The concentrate needed some amount of acid blend, but the grape juice has acid in it also. I really hope the 2 tsp of the acid blend Ive added is not overboard.

Heres to the start of my journey and glad to meet everyone!",winemaking
"Odd flavor (newbie here) Hi all, just finished a Chilean Malbec wine kit. I bottled half and put half in a 10L oak barrel. It has only been in the barrel for 2 measly days. 

Tonight, my wife and I wanted to open a bottle so I poured two glasses from the barrel (it has a spout), then topped the barrel up with a freshly opened bottle.

The glass of wine tastes and smells odd. It literally tastes like I soaked a wood chip in water and then drank the water. I know it's only been two days, so I am wondering if this flavor is only going to get worse. It doesn't taste like an oaked malbec, it tastes pretty bad right now.",winemaking

"Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 2 Part 2:

Primary fermentation has begun!

As of yesterday morning, I have 2 buckets with 3 gal each undergoing primary fermentation. I want to make both batches with as much consistency as possible so that the only differing variable is the malolactic conversion on the one batch. With that in mind, my procedure for separating the batches was as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  I started by separating the bentonite and yeast packets into 2 equal portions for each ingredient, 1/2 bentonite packet and 1/2 yeast packet for each batch.
2. I then Carefully measured and separated the juice concentrate into the separate buckets.
3. Added the bentonite to each batch and topped up with water to the 3 gal mark.
4. Took a gravity reading from each sample and luckily ended up with the same gravity on the first try. 1.090 on the dot for each batch.
5.  I tried to take a pH reading using test strips but the result was skewed by the wine color. I thought the strips I bought were able to be used with red wine but I guess not.
6. Took a malic acid reading using test strips and both batches showed the same result of &gt;300mg/l. 
7. Pitched the yeast, covered, and set aside to ferment.

&amp;#x200B;

Lessons learned:

&amp;#x200B;

\-the pH test strips I bought were not the proper strips for red wine. I'm not sure if there are any that will work but I plan to buy a digital meter for the subsequent readings.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward:

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to inoculate for MLF this evening or tomorrow morning. My decision will be based on how steadily the fermentation is proceeding (when the bubbler is consistent and frequent I'll pitch the bacteria).

&amp;#x200B;

As always, your thoughts and input are appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Cheers

"Made a few blunders, wondering how things will go. Hello all. I decided on a whim the other day to try my hand at making my first batch of wine. I hadn't found this subreddit yet, so I was mostly going off the advice of my redneck ancestors and my other experiences with fermentation (I've been in the kombucha and ginger bug game for years), and just threw some juice I had on hand into a 1 gal airlocked carboy with some sugar and yeast to see what would happen. I left a ton of headspace (like a good 3-4 inches below the neck) as I didn't have as much juice as I thought. It's been bubbling away just fine, but I decided to throw in some more juice and a few raisins to bring up the level last night. As of this morning, it's still bubbling away, but after perusing this sub I'm starting to wonder if I committed a fatal error by adding more juice or removing the airlock temporarily. Did I ruin it?

* *2-1/2 lbs. granulated sugar*
* *1 1/2 tsp. acid blend*

The questions I have are.

Why was it good and now not so much?

"Need help. Making lychee wine in developing country. Hey there
I work in Madagascar and the trees are dripping with lychee right now. Next week will be peak ripeness.

The growers sell them by the ""karaba"" which is a handwoven basket that is maybe 40-50lbs of fruit. They can get 3-4$ per one of these baskets full IF they can get it to a city or onto a truck headed there. and the road and conditions are so bad that they often spoil before they can get to a city to be sulfur dusted/refridgerated. Im looking for ways to increase their income and making them into alcohol onsite is one of them.

I have made fruit wines years ago in the states just for hobby purposes but never took it very seriously. Best wine I made was a plum wine with fruit from our plum tree.

Going to experiment this year with a few personal setups and see if lychee wine is drinkable before trying to get people onboard next year. I need to use only materials they can get here to start with. This means using old methods.

Im thinking stomping the lychee by foot, filling a jerrycan with juice, added sugar will probably be lychee flower honey or rough cane sugar because its cheap around here, and using a condom as the airlock. Only yeast I can get is going to be wild yeast or bakers. I can sanitize with chlorine or bleach only. The bottles will have to be plastic as glass is near impossible to transport on these """"roads"""" without shattering. This wont be a gourmet product aimed at western markets, but at other Malagasy people in the cities. They already make grape wine and sell it in shitty plastic bottles in the regions that can grow grapes (not here!) and it does pretty well. They also make and sell a raw sugar cane wine called Betsa in a region just to the south of here and sell it by the jerrycan for parties that is actually pretty delicious. Im hoping to get something similar started for lychee here.

I am 3 days rough travel from the nearest city likely to have supplies of any kind.

Just asking if yall think this method is vaguely sound. As in jerrycan full of pressed lychee juice + yeast + adding some quantity of sugar + time (not sure how long i should aim for). Im also unsure if it should be 100% lychee juice or if I should add water. cost of lychee isnt an issue. Where I am, transporting them to get the market price is so hard they are essentially free if you gather them yourself.

Im also worried about how I will know when fermentation is finished. I dont have any measurment tools.",winemaking

"Wine Stopped Fermenting. Please help! I've been making wine with my grandparents for 9 years now and my grandpa passed away last year and he was the expert. We do it old-school Austrian style. Crush grapes and add sugar with warm water. (I don't think it's a factor, but this year my grandma's water heater stopped working so we used cold water.) We then press the grapes and put them in old Bourbon barrels that we clean and then burn sulfur in. The ""wine"" was fermenting great up until last week so we turned up the heat a few degrees in the basement because it's been colder than usual in Wisconsin and that did nothing. No bubbling at all. This has never happened before as we always have a couple bottles of wine at Thanksgiving, but then enjoy the finished product at Christmas. My grandparents have never changed this process so not adding yeast or anything isn't the reason. 

My grandpa once told me that his cousin's wine wasn't fermenting after not using sulfur in the barrels so they emptied the barrels, put burning sulfur in them, added the wine and they started fermenting. Did I possibly not use enough sulfur? I'm not exactly sure what the sulfur does except I know it's necessary. Any and all help/suggestions would be amazing because we've lost the person that would know exactly what to do. Thank you in advance!!",winemaking

"I think I may have accidentally made wine. Help me figure out what happened? Hi everyone,

I hope someone here can advise. So we live on a farm which has a number of different trees including a couple grape vines.

About 6 weeks ago, I picked some of those grapes and decided to make juice. Put them in the blender, then filled them in bottles, and put them in the fridge.

However I didn't get around to actually drinking the juice and over the last month things above been happening to them.

1) After about 1 week, they started to get gasssy and smell acidic. I tasted a bit, which was like a mixture of juice and vinegar with gas.

2) Again I didn't drink them. After 3 weeks, the gases increased, it tasted more acidic.

3) I didn't know what was happening, and out of curiosity, I let the bottles remain in the fridge a bit longer.

4) It has now been about 6 weeks since I initially put the bottles of juice in the fridge. NOW

- There is no longer an acidic smell. 
- The gases seen to be gone.
- Surprisingly the ""juice"" does not smell spoilt. It smells a bit sweet, and not quite like juice anymore.

Now I have two questions:

1) Did I accidentally make wine? I did not drink any of it as I am afraid, however it smells surprisingly good.

2) How do I know if it's safe to drink or throw out? I wouldn't like to throw them out because I spent a lot of effort making the juice (or whatever it is now). I wouldn't like it to waste.

Please advise, and sorry if this is a weird question.",winemaking

"Help! My elderberry wine won't ferment... I've run into a really weird problem with my latest batch of elderberry wine - it's a 5 gallon batch using 16 lbs of fresh elderberries and 10 lbs of sugar (to keep things simple, I just boiled the water and sugar together and poured over the berries to sanitize). I'm trying to ferment on the fruit, so I haven't removed the berries from the rest of the juice, and I originally pitched a packet of Lalvin EC-1118 a little over a month ago (hoping for a pretty dry wine). There was a little bit of airlock activity initially, then it stopped before much fermentation had taken place. Since I ordered the yeast online, I thought maybe it got shocked in transit, and I purchased another packet of 1118 from a local homebrew store and pitched that a few weeks ago. However, that didn't result in much airlock activity either, and gravity of the juice/wine is still at around 1.070 (for reference, the ambient temperature around the carboy is around 65-70 F). I really don't understand why it's not fermenting, and would greatly appreciate any thoughts or suggestions you may have!",winemaking
"Is this recipe safe? I came across [this recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/do0hoa/here_are_some_instructions_on_how_to_brew/) on /r/recipes recently and decided to give it a whirl because I wanted to make something more interesting than grape-based wine.

So I went to the supermarket and grabbed some Welch's juices (Dragon Mango and a Passion Fruit blend), some Fleischmann's Rapid Rise yeast, and some sugar, and mixed it all together as the recipe states and left it in a dark area with the cap unscrewed a little.

I've seen some websites state that hooch can be dangerous, but it seems they're all referring to the vile concoctions made in prison and the only other resources I see that talk about it suggest bread yeast is not good to use because it will have a low alcohol content (5 - 8%).

I don't really care whether or not it knocks me on my ass... I just want to know if the method described in that post and the ingredients I used will be safe to drink once filtered, or if I should just throw it out?

Any info would be appreciated.",winemaking

"Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 1 I made a post recently which started a discussion in the comments about taking a kit wine through malolactic fermentation/conversion. It seems the general consensus is that kit wine and MLF do not go well together. Either producing harsh aromas or affecting the acid balance and leaving the wine tasting terribly (flabby).

&amp;#x200B;

I did a lot of googling and online searching to find out whether anyone has ever successfully done MLF on a kit wine and I failed to find anything. So naturally, this is the perfect chance to have some fun and maybe settle the debate once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The experiment:

* The kit I plan on using is a 6 gal. Syrah kit from Wine Expert (or equivalent) not the highest quality stuff but maybe middle of the road.
* I'll take the entire 6 gal. through primary fermentation per the instructions and then split it in half  by racking into 2 - 3 gal. carboys. One carboy will be the control wine, the remaining steps will be completed per the kit instructions. The other carboy will be the MLF wine.
* I'll have all the necessary testing supplies on hand to check acidity, SO2, etc. and adjust as needed.
* Both wines will undergo the same testing so that results can be compared.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be updating periodically with photos, test results, general notes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before I start, does anyone have any suggestions or see anything I can improve? Is syrah a good varietal to use or is there another that would work better? For all you kit experts, which brand would you suggest?",winemaking

"HELP! Why does my ros√© to be smell like vinegar after campden and pectolase? Last batch of the season, and we decided to try our hands at ros√©, at the usual 50 litres.
Got 2 kinds of pink grapes that weren't very pink (no black or red grapes where we live anymore) and so we decided to throw in the juice of one pomegranate at the last minute. Put campden. Waited 5 - 6 hours and then added the pectolase. The usual dosages. Left it with a wine bag on top overnight, next to a similar batch of standard white.
Today, during squeezing time I noticed that the must smelt a little like nail polish remover and /or vinegar. Removed a bunch of must from the top and though the smell has reduced, it is still there. The taste is delicious but just a tad like vinegar.
The must is also producing sporadic bubbles.

The white that was right next to it however is completely fine.

"Community input: Improved campden tabs? We‚Äôre a small research lab friends and family have been bugging to come up with a better/ faster/ stronger campden tablet. Kidding aside they want to know if we can achieve the same effect while reducing the sulfite content of their finished product. And some other things they think could be better about the tablets.

We know chemistry but we‚Äôre not winemakers so we wanted to get some more feedback and maybe spark the interest of a few beta testers as we work through this problem. And to help us figure out how much time we should really put into it. Aka is it a real industry pain point or just a hair-brained idea from folks we‚Äôre obliged to at least pretend to listen to (:

With that in mind any thoughts on what‚Äôs available in the world of campden tablets and how we could make it better would be greatly appreciated. We‚Äôre thinking about these sorts of things, which may or may not apply:

o Reduce sulfites without reducing efficacy 
o Sodium vs. potassium-based, or blended
o Different tablet size, bigger or smaller

"Cold ferment--when to rack? I'm an enthusiastic beer maker, but rather new to winemaking and am taking my first stab at a thiol-heavy Marlborough-style Sauvingnon Blanc. I'm just using an RJS kit, but I replaced the EC-1118 with the not-so-easy-to-find-in-Canada QA-23 and am fermenting cold to try to cultivate extra grapefruit and passionfruit. 

It's been fermenting at 62¬∞f for 12 days now, but I am unsure when to get it off the yeast. I want to rack it soon because my previous batch has some residual EC-1118 on the nose and I'm wondering if I had it exposed to the yeast too long (I was a dummy and degassed before transferring for the first time--oof). 

But I also don't want to starve it of healthy yeast, since I was very hesitant to add much nutrient, given that I couldn't acquire Stimula Sauvignon or another thiol-seeking equivalent.

Should I just transfer whenever because I'm completely out-to-lunch and need to use Marlborough grapes if I want to make that kind of wine?

"To the store bought grape juice wine makers.... Hey there! I too, have been curious as to what store bought grape juice would taste like as wine. One day I was at Costco and saw they had their brand of Kirkland Concord grape juice in a three liter two pack for, gosh I don't know, like $6-7. I get a little excited and so I bought enough to make 5 gallons of this stuff. I don't remember exactly the kind of yeast or how much sugar I put it. It might have been close to 10 pounds of sugar added. I'm getting better and AT LEAST dating my carboys so I know how long they've been sitting. But here's the cool part...  


I made a few one gallon batches and couldn't resist to try them out after oh, I don't know, about a month maybe. Effing god awful. You can taste the alcohol before the grapes for sure. Not EXACTLY the cool part, but w/e. After making another two one gallon batches I grew more patient and waited about six months before trying one of them. Gotta say, a little hoochie, but not bad. I tried the second one about a year and some months later (no date on the carboy but had to at least been a year), it was actually quite pleasant. Sweet, but not overly, somewhat tarty and what I can only describe as a date/caramel finish. 

I'm going to get some more carboys (maybe) five or so and make one each year on the same day. After 5 years, the last one made will be a year old, then I will compare them. Sorry to all the serious wine makers out there, I'll get there one day and will be looking for your knowledge and expertise, but for now I'm experimenting.

"Home wine making and bottle ageing I have been making wine for almost two years with a monthly rhythm now of 1 gallon every month. I let my wines go dry, bottling after 3 to 6 months, racking only if sediment looks deep. I never add sorbates, fining agents and I don‚Äôt degas at bottling time.

It‚Äôs been my observation that nearly all the fermentation happens in the primary. So the role of the secondary:

* Finish fermentation and let the yeast clean up things
* Age
* Clarify 

So my conjecture is that bottle ageing has little benefit except for wines with ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù taste factors involved, such as use of the skins, oaking, etc.

But if I‚Äôm making non-fruit wines or wines from juice, I think that the need for bottle ageing is largely a myth. Thoughts?",winemaking

Clean and sanitize keg, put on gas and fill with co2, purge multiple times, pop the top just enough to get the beer line in, gravity feed the beer into the keg, gas on, purge a few more times. The only variable has been I got new CO2 from airgas.

Last two beers, one a kolsch, one a spiced holiday dark beer, both tasted fine on day 1 &amp; 2, but by day 3 they were bitter, wet cardboard tasting. The prior batches were almost exclusively West Coast IPA and NEIPA, and I never had an issue with what should be more volatile brews.

"Help with Lagers So I've been brewing for a long time, but lately I've noticed that my lagers come out ""yeasty"" (quotes for a reason). I have a Czech pils on tap right now which has the same issue, though otherwise good. For Christmas I filled a gallon keg to take to my father and a 16 oz twistee to ship to my brother. Because of the size of the keg, my father and I drank it at about 45¬∞F (outside temperature that day) and it tasted amazingly crisp. I asked my brother and he said he only detected a faint off flavor that he only noticed because I asked him to look for it.

Some details: initial fermentation at 50¬∞F, raised to 64¬∞F after 5 days for a 4 day rest, then lagered at 30-35¬∞F for about 4-5 weeks. OG 1.054, FG 1.009 using Wyeast 2278. After filling the keg and can, they sat on the counter overnight at 65-70¬∞F.

So I am wondering if maybe I have been having DMS issues and not realizing it because I wasn't good at identifying it, or if somehow the off gassing during filling scrubbed some kind of off flavor? I just drank a beer off the tap and it still had the ""yeasty"" flavor that might just be DMS. 

But if this is DMS, then why isn't my 4 day rest enough? Why does it seem to not be there when I sample during kegging? I had become convinced I had oxidation issues during cold crashing, but now I am not so sure.

"Anyone use Flot-it keg buoys? Good morning fellow homebrewers. I have gotten back into this wonderful hobby after a 10 year hiatus. I have a 10gallon AG batch of Denny Conn's Rye IPA dry hopping in the primary currently. I plan to secondary and serve in my 10 gal corny keg. Since I've come back to brewing all sorts of neat inventions have come into reality (bluetooth hydrometer?!?).  One of which is keg buoys. The unit offered by MoreBeer has mixed reviews. I opted instead for the Flot-It unit off eBay.

"Advice before bottling Merry Christmas homebrewers around the world. I am seeking your advice before bottling a batch of Pilsner that I brewed (from a kit) about 4 months ago... It fermented in my garage in August at around 13-16C (southern hemisphere winter). I then planned to lager it in a wine fridge at about 5 degrees Celsius. I was in 2 minds about racking to a 2nd fermenter before lagering but in the end just left it in the initial fermenter (I got busy with other things - but did put it in the fridge). I've read a few different suggestions, like add new yeast, stir to rouse the yeast, or just bottle as is - there's enough yeast still in suspension... what is your advice? The kit was WilliamsWarn, I boiled some additional Saaz hops, I used Saflager S-23 lager yeast. Also what temperature should the bottles be stored at? I usually bulk prime.

Seeing no FG changes, I decided to bottle.  But, the other night upon opening the bottle, I was greeted with a black-brown geyser of beer.

It was quite the letdown when I went to pop a bottle open in front of a crowd on Christmas' eve...first an Earth-shattering \*POP\*, several seconds of anticipation, and then a beer geyser from the bottle!  

After pouring out the remaining beer in the bottle, I found a lovely and fairly strong maple - chocolate - coffee (?) stout.

"The annual tradition of canning 5 gallons of starter. Every year I can 5 gallons of starter wort. It takes a few hours, and is perfect to do over Christmas, because there's a lot of sitting around anyway. [Here's the process in action](https://i.imgur.com/DGoT5tJ.jpg)

This is my technique:

* 7.5 pounds of 2-row

* Add 10 quarts of 168-170 degree water, and mash in. Target temp is 150 degrees, lower is better.
* Collect the first runnings
* Sparge with 2.0 gallons of water
* Sparge again with 2.5 gallons water until 5 gallons is reached.


The boil
* I usually boil for 15-20 mins to get some of the sulfur compounds to evolve off.


Canning:
* I can in 1/2 gallon jars, and optionally, add 1/2 teaspoon of yeast nutrient to the jars before canning.
* Can at 15 pounds for 15 minutes.

Anyway, I want to get away from the carboys. Cleaning the auto siphon stinks. Worrying about when I need to replace the siphon because of possible contamination causes me anxiety. 

I've done some research into cost effective alternatives and I seem to have landed on the Anvil 7.5 gallon stainless steel bucket fermenters.

"Chocolate Stout Fining First off, Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to all homebrewing brothers and sisters!

I made a chocolate stout for the season for the first time. It tastes fantastic but there's a ton of suspended sediment in it. Wondering if that's just the cocoa or not?

I put 4 oz cocoa nibs (forgot to roast them though) in a tincture of bourbon for about a week before adding the liquid, strained, into my primary. Let it sit for a couple days then cold crashed at 32F for 2 days, then it sat at 45F for 3 or 4 days before I closed transferred to a keg. 

This process has served me well for other beers but as I said, this time the beer is very ""dirty""? Is that harmful? Is it the cocoa? Should I leave it be and enjoy or try gelatin?

I've only done cider, mead, and one wine myself but did a beer with a local club a few months so decided to give it a try.

Specifically I need like 1.25lbs of malt extract and only 5g total of hops.  Does anyone know where I can find ingredients in these quantities?  Otherwise does anyone know how best to store DME and hops?  I've the malt I need in the exact amount, the malt extract in 1lb and 1.125lbs, and hops in 1oz.

"Yeast Harvest from Conicals. Hello and happy holidays! I recently (three months ago) switched to grainfather conical fermenters. I'm thoroughly enjoying them but only recently started using them to harvest yeast. 

My question is does it matter if I just pull a healthy looking slug out of the middle of the cone, or do I really need to wash it? I've pulled great samples of some 1056 wyeast from the dump valve, and have just been pitching them straight up. The fermentations have started within 12 hours, and the beers have been great, very strong and coming to full attenuation within 7-10 days. I don't let the yeast sit in fridge for more than a week or so. Obviously my method is working, I'm just wondering if I'm introducing off flavors etc. 

I am well aware the slugs will carry hoppy flavors from IPAs etc, but if I am jumping from one beer to another the same ish style does it really matter? Pale ale to IPA, porter to stout etc. 

Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing here. I really enjoy being lazy, but also want to make the beer possible.

Now I am designing the electrical enclosure. I'm using a 16x8x6 electrical enclosure cabinet/wall box. I needed an enclosure that was not too deep, as the kettle will be in front of it and I do not have too much space on my walls anymore.

When wiring the enclosure I've taken much care into wiring with thick enough cables, so that in theory I can just upgrade with a juicier element when I want without rewiring. I use 40A SSRs, even though the elements are about 13A. If I decide to switch elements I'll have to change wires throughout the house so that is a future job. 

I've painted the enclosure black so it does not stand out too much, and I'm planning to add indicator lights on the side so that I can see when the elements are firing, and also turn them off manually for cleaning. I'd like to avoid circumstances where they dry fire or fire during cleaning. I'm going to look for a smaller 12v power supply unit, to make room for two smaller contactors to control elements independently.

"Ol man bought a basic ale kit and shipped it to me for xmas, thought I'd make a post because I have a few questions about brewing in general Hope all I have to say is allowed, new to beer brewing and since I have a busy day and wont be able to spend quality time researching the many questions on my mind. Going to do my best to make them broad and not heavily specific in Hope's for a well thought out list of answers and advice

So this kit is from the company craft a brew, a 1 gallon brown ale starting kit. Havent started it just yet, waiting for xmas which is my next day off. No real questions about the kit itself, 

the questions I have are about what styles of beer work best for aging? I want to age some brews once I get the hang of brewing. And dont want to waste a batch learning the hard way. Especially when it comes to ales. 3-5 litre aging barrels arent terribly expensive online so doesnt hurt to experiment outside of what I've used one for in the past...which was aging London dry gin.....which is not too bad, worth trying if you're not a gin drinker

What is easier to brew and more difficult amongst every style of beer? I just dont want to get a difficult recipe going and discourage myself from brewing 

Adding flavor beyond the grains and sweeteners, for fruits do I mash them up and add it to the mix or cut them, or leave whole, or which ones per types of fruit since a raspberry and apple are completely different

Do you add extra yeast if you want to try and go for a 8-12% abv? 

Honey, maple syrup, agave nectar and other natural non sugar sweeteners, how much would be too much in a recipe that doesnt call for sweet ingredients such as what I listed

Replacing water with tea or coffee, or even sap, how would that work out on a 100% substitution? 

Adding herbs and spices. Is that even a thing?

And most importantly, as far as ales are concerned, how long is too long for fermentation, as well as aging?

I have some unique ideas going on in my head about what would I add or substitute ontop of a generic recipe to create the perfect ale for me. I love all types of ales, some more than others. This gift I hope ends up becoming a regular hobby, I've never brewed beer before, I've only brewed mead and it was simple and pretty good for only doing it once. 

Growlers, kegs/barrels, cans, jars or regular bottles with a capping machine, what is ideal, or cost effective, best for preserving longer than like a couple months? I definitely want to try every logical means of storage, however not sure which I should invest in first. All batches after my 1st from this kit I want to store them and not drink it all like a thirsty drunk lol

"I think my Brew Jacket's Jacket is wrong My wife got me a Brew Jacket for Xmas.

I typically brew in carboys or buckets, and the box for this thing says it's for bucket/'carboy brewing.

Perhaps I'm an idiot (the wife would say I am), but the jacket that came with it doesn't seem right to me.  There's the circular zipper end on it that's the bottom, right?

"Building ""high-end"" homebrewery - looking for setup recommendation Hello Everyone,

I've been brewing for a couple of years while upgrading my equipment here and there. At the moment, I use a 10 Gal MLT setup (for 5-6Gal batches), which I'm very comfortable with. I have 2x 7Gal fermentors (one anvil-like stainless, one Fermzilla). As the title suggests, I'm looking to GREATLY improve my brewing and I have a decent budget to spend. I'm looking for additional pros and cons on certain elements I'd like to purchase, and recommendations of pro homebrewers that were in my shoes earlier in their career.

My goal would be to brew bigger batches with precise temperature control. On the cold side, I'm looking to experiment with yeasts comparison and aging comparison. I'm looking to both keg and bottle. I'm not that interested in bottle conditioning; I already own a Tapcooler counter pressure filler and I would prefer to use it. Cleaning wise, I'd like to CIP everthing.

The first piece I'm eyeing is the Grainfather G70. Electric brewing seems A+ here and I believe my hot side will be covered. My question resides more on the cold side of the thing. As the G70 brews &gt;40L batches, I need more fermentors (either 14Gal or 2x 7Gal per batch). 

This is where my hesitation resides.  For my interest; yeasts comparison sounds like a 2x 7 Gal thing and the aging comparison looks like a 1 x 14Gal one then split in two carboys. If I were to use plastic Fermzilla things, well it would be a no-brainer and I'd just buy everything, but I'm looking for more sturdy gear (like SS from ss brewtech or spike?). I can handle a little bit of DIY but I'd rather spend a few more $ than having a highly custom setup.

"Beginner (again) question Last time I brewed beer or cider was about six years ago. I got bored and decided to make a batch of cider again yesterday, so off to the store I go to pick up 5 gallons of apple juice. After cleaning and sanitizing my fermenting pale, I picked it up, and a big chunk of it broke off - needless to say I need to go pick up a new fermenter today.  Now for my question... while the bucket was sitting with sanitizer in it, I was making a syrup of my sugars to add in, which I heated up to about 200 degrees. I immediately covered the pot (still hot) with Saran Wrap since I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be brewing last night. The Saran Wrap was too hot to touch from the steam, and it was sealed off above 185 degrees. Will I need to get more sugar and throw this syrup out? Will it be ok since it was above sanitary temperatures when I covered it? Should I add more juice to the syrup tonight and reheat it?  Am I an idiot?",Homebrewing

"Need advice on next steps Hello - I am seeking advice on next steps. I brewed an all-grain nut brown from Northern Brewer on Dec 5. This was my first batch of all-grain I have made so I ended up with 1.042 (should have been 44). I used wyeast 1098 but think It may have been too cold during fermentation. I had solid fermentation for the first 2 days. Then decent fermentation for a couple more days after I moved my fermenter into warmer tempatures. The room tempature initially was around 62-63. Now it is in 67-71. I racked on the 12th into secondary. I waited another week until the 19th and prepared to bottle but the gravity was only at 1.020. I checked the gravity again yesterday and it was at 1.018. My question is, should I a) wait longer to see if it ferments down to 1.010 b) pitch another batch of yeast or c) some other magic I have not contemplated. If it means anything, the airlock is bubbling about every 60 seconds. Thanks in advance",Homebrewing
"Accidentally picked a lager yeast for a faux-lager kit. What will it do at high (~23C) temperatures? Hey everyone!

I was recently gifted a Mangrove Jack's Dutch Lager kit (the malt in a can kind) by some mates who are aware I'm into homebrewing. I've made meads before, as well as an awful Red Bull experiment, but this is my first time brewing beer. 

I decided to use some Brewmaster Premium Brewblend 10, and Morgan's Premium Lager Yeast. Unfortunately, due to my experience with brewing and the fact that I don't really drink beer much, I completely ignored the fact that lagers are fermented at low temperatures.

The yeast is rated for around 12C ideal, 15C max, but I'll be at around 23C. While I'm not *too* worried (RDWHAHB and all), I'm curious what effects it'll have. Will it not perform at all, or will it cause strange flavors?

Full details:

* 1.7kg Mangrove Jack's Dutch Lager kit
* 1kg Brewmaster Premium Brewblend 10
* 15g Morgan's Premium Lager Yeast
* 23L volume
* 1.032 OG

I have a fridge I've converter into a kegerator and use the fridge compartment to store the kegs and yeast. I also use the freezer compartment to store the hops, but it's mostly empty since I don't stock that much hops.

I've been wondering if I could add a glycol deposit and a pump on the freezer compartment and use that to chill my fermenter (6gal max). I could fit a 20L glycol reservoir which will sit at -18C. Will this be enough to drop the temperature of the fermenter 20 or 30C? Is it fine to run glycol at -18C through the fermenter coil? Will I burn my fridge engine if the glycol gets too hot?

I am experimenting with fermenting directly in keg. The 2 first fermentations where done under pressure. The first one was a stout and good. The second one was a dobble Bock and was ... weird.

My last try is in the same keg without pressure just a blow off tube. The fermentation went well. FG as expected - a little on the dry side. Now I tested it after 1 week in the fridge. Boom same taste. This off flavor I have difficulty to describe...

I brewed a stout (OG 1.071).

"post-boil wort cooling with a fan with lid on? For most of the last five years, once my boil was over, I'd get some oven mitts on and lug my near-boiling wort inside and up some stairs to the kitchen that I was hooking my immersion chiller up to.  This past spring, I decided it was a great time to retire that method.  I got lucky never dumping six gallons of boiling liquid all over myself but it is totally something that could happen.  So far, I've just hooked my immersion chiller up to a hose hookup outside.  Now that it's actually cold out, I've turned that faucet off from the inside.  I also wouldn't want to ice up my driveway that bad.

To make a short story long, has anybody that lives in a cold climate had success putting the lid on the pot and just pointing some fans at the pot?  The air I would be blowing at the pot would be significantly colder than any water I've ever used in an immersion chiller.  The downside is I won't be able to gently stir it like I do with my immersion chiller.  I really want the lid on because the fans will likely pick debris up from the garage floor and let it fly into the wort.  I do some pretty vigorous boils so I'm not super worried about DMS for the cooling period unless it drags on for much longer than my immersion chiller would take.

I've tried setting my pot in a snowbank before but it doesn't work nearly as well as you'd think.  The pot melts the snow touching the sides of the pot immediately, leaving an air gap that I'm sure provides some insulation from the rest of the snow.",Homebrewing
"Please criticize my first attempt at making cider/alcohol! Hello everyone,

I have recently tried making cider for the first time and would like some feedback on my recipe/methods/etc. since I'm only mildly satisfied with my first attempt.

The Recipe: - I kept this very simple for my first attempt.

4.5 gallons of Treetop ""3 apple blend"" apple juice.
1 tsp Pectin Enzyme (for clarity)
5 tsp Yeast Nutrient
1 Packet of Lalvin K1-V1116 yeast
No sugar/sweetener added. OG: 1.048
Fermenting: - I let ferment for two weeks until I saw no activity in the carboy. Fermentation took place in a dark room around 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

FG: 1.000-1.002

Kegging/Racking: - I cold crashed for 24 hours for clarity. I then transferred the cider to a Corny Keg and backsweetened with 24oz of Treetop Apple juice concentrate with 1/4 tsp Potassium Meta-Bisulfate and 2.5 tsp of Potassium Sorbate.

I then let sit at cellar temperatures (45 degrees Fahrenheit) and let sit at 16 psi for two weeks. It's okay. My friend described it having a ""vomit taste"" which I can pick up on a tiny bit. It has a bit of acidity that is very prominent at warmer temps, but it's not undrinkable, I'm curious if that's because the K1-V1116 champagne yeast... I'm drinking it at cellar temp and it's not bad, but nothing exciting or ""great"" by any means.

It's a little too sweet for my taste, I regret adding 24oz of juice concentrate instead of the 12oz I originally intended, but I can live with it.

When I try this again I plan on letting it ferment for at least another week, adding some sugar initially to boost the gravity slightly, and maybe using a different yeast (S-04?) and probably adding a different flavor of juice to back sweeten, but I'm not sure yet.

Any advice/feedback based on my first attempt? I'm not upset, but I am slightly disappointed. I was hoping for something a bit more enjoyable. Thank you!",Homebrewing

"The yeast suddenly stopped fermenting. Is something wrong? So, a couple weeks ago, I brewed up a cider, where I pasteurised the apples to extract the juice, and then took my readings, pitched the yeast, yada yada yada. It worked out great üëç 
But a couple days ago, I tried juicing a bunch of oranges and pomegranates I had lying around, but just juiced them and didn‚Äôt pasteurise it, but otherwise went through the same process as the cider, with one other exception. This time, the morning after I pitched my yeast, I stirred all the foamy stuff and bits of pulp that rose up and stuck to the walls of the fermenter, back into the mash. All seemed to be going well, with the airlock bubbling away all day and night. Then this morning, after I woke up, I stirred it all up again, cuz the pulp had settled at the bottom, and I wanted to make sure the yeast had all their nutrients and the flavour of the fruit would continue to blend. But after I sealed it back up, it stopped fermenting entirely. No pressure showing at the airlock. Should I not have stirred it? Do the yeast just need their alone time, once they get started? Or did they actually completely finish? I find the latter option a bit hard to believe, since the apple batch was bubbling for about a week, but this one was only 2 nights and a day. I used the same yeast each time, and it‚Äôs almost the same quantity of liquid, though a little less sugar in this batch (1080 for the cider, and 1070 for this one). Granted, it‚Äôs also a liter or two less liquid, and it‚Äôs a turbo yeast, but the difference of 5 days of bubbling seems too big to ignore. I have not yet checked the gravity reading since it stopped, as I want to leave it until morning, just in case, so I will check to see the sugar content tomorrow.
But in the meantime, does anyone have any input/thoughts?
It would suck if this batch was bad, cuz all that juicing was a lot of work",Homebrewing
"How long do you reuse yeast slurry for? A few years ago i used to freeze my yeast in test tubes with glycerin. It was time consuming. And always required a starter. But took up very little space.

I‚Äôve been storing part of the yeast cakes in a sanitized pint jars in my fridge. When it comes time to brew, i re-suspend the yeast/trub by shaking the jar and let the it come to room temp before pitching the whole damn thing.

So, what I did is drive down to their brewery today and bought 3 bottles of Peeper to culture the yeast, but I also bought a packet of WLP001 in case the starter didn't work. I was thinking of pitching both the yeast starter cultured from the bottles and the WLP001, and was wondering if anyone has done the same (in a similar fashion) with any success? Happy to share any additional info on my upcoming brew day.

"Kegged IPA won't carbonate I have an IPA on tap that I kegged 2 weeks ago and it hasn't carbonated at all. I think I've had this issue with the last several IPAs I've kegged. Meanwhile other beers seem to be carbonating just fine. I have a cider on tap that I kegged *after* the IPA and it's well on its way to being fully carbed. 

Here are some details to help with troubleshooting:

* Keezer is kept at 34¬∞F and the regulator is set to 12 psi
* I have verified that the keg does not leak and CO2 is entering the keg (when I pull the PRV a nice blast of 12psi CO2 comes out, and when I pour myself a sample of the IPA I can hear the CO2 entering the keg to replace the beer I poured) 
* This IPA (and my others) is dry hopped in the keg by suspending a mesh bag with pellet hops from the underside of the keg lid. Could this possibly be keeping CO2 from staying in solution? Seems unlikely given the keg is a sealed and pressurized system... but bagged dry hops are a unique and common variable that applies only to the IPAs I keg, and these are the only ones I have carb issues with. 
* No leaks anywhere in my kegging setup and the CO2 tank isn't empty

"Lower ABV than expected Hello all!

Were in the late stages of fermentation on the first beer we've ever brewed. We're doing a pre-made kit using Wyeast 3068.

The kit is a grainfather G30 with graincape and an SS brewtech Brewbucket and a plaato airlock.
We made sure to sanitize everything very properly before airating the wort by splashing it in the Brewbucket from a height we found acceptable. We pitched the yeast with the same temperature as the wort after the counterflow chiller (+-19 degrees c).

Our OG was 1.057 for a recipe that asked for 1.055. Our brewday was a bit odd. We lost about 3L during mashing, making a 19L pre-sparge batch into a 16L one, we sparged with about 4,5-5L according the recipe. Boiling about 65 minutes, adding the Tettnang hops 20 minutes into the boil.

However, after 4 days in the fermenter our gravity is reading 1.027 with almost no activity in the airlock. The sample smells like a weizen, has a hint of banana in there (which is exactly what we aimed for) and looks cloudy, without any trub.

Is it possible we have a lower ABV than expected due to under pitching?",Homebrewing

"Is my hard cider ruined or still okay? About five years ago I made my first batch of hard cider and today I revisited it thinking age may turn what was a rough first attempt in to something a little more palatable. 

Cracked it open and it still has carbonation since, before bottling, I added a pinch of plain sugar.

Unfortunately it still tastes much of the same from what I remember It doesn't taste great but, IIRC, the gravity suggested it was around 11% so maybe that's just the way it's suppose to be but definitely wasn't vinegar. 

That being said, I noticed it's clearer and that there are clumps/a layer of something which is on the bottom. I gave these bottles a nice scrub with the ""pink stuff"" prior to bottling and I took the measures needed to not have it go wild so I suspect it's either yeast which has crashed over the years or maybe even an infection but don't have the know how to know.

I've started brewing my own beer a couple of months back and I have been brewing about 8x 1gal batches since then. All of them were coming out drinkable at least and downright delicious at times. Until now.

* The smell is disgusting. I looked up smells of oxidized beer but I can't really put my finger on whether it matches any of them or not.

"Fuller's ESB Clone - What's the IBU? I'm working on a clone of Fuller's ESB, and have looked at a lot of recipes online.

"Transferred through Moldy Spigot. Dump? [Backstory, I had a mold issue in my fermenting chamber due to the humidity, which I‚Äôll be remedying for the next round.]

The beer in the fermenter was fine. It was a 7.2% West Coast IPA. Tasted a little 1oz sample and absolutely delicious. No signs of mold in the sample or in the transfer. I always spray StarSan into the spigot right before I transfer. 

However, I noticed as I was cleaning up my equipment that there was a mold clump growing inside of the spigot I had transferred to the bottling bucket with!!! The mold was bluish/greenish/black. Spigot was disassembled/cleaned well previously so it had to come from the humidity in the fermenter over the last 3 weeks.

Wade‚Äôs health has been on the decline for the last years.

And recently, Wade got hospitalized with COVID in his late 60s.

My brother is an experienced home distiller with many years of experience under his belt. His work has been featured in the local Californian newspapers, Wine Enthusiast Magazine, the NY Times, and other publications. Westbay is currently retired, but caries on the passion of distilling. In his book he takes you through the basics of making great Whiskey, Whisky &amp; Bourbon from the comfort of your own home. His guidebook helps you explores the critical science in plenty of detail to carry on your whiskey distilling efforts.

"2020 hops What experiences have you guys had with 2020 crop-year hops so far? I have a standard single-hop IPA recipe that I like to brew repeatedly whenever I order hops in bulk (I buy 1# bags from YVH as soon as the year's harvest becomes available). Hop-wise the recipe is 0.5oz at 10min, 2.0oz at flameout, 2.5oz dry hop for 2 days, Chico yeast.

2019 Citra, for example, was pretty incredible in my opinion. Very tropical and pungent. Loads of flavor and aroma.

2020 Mosaic, on the other hand, is extremely meh and disappointing. Very little fruity or ""dank"" flavor, just kind of a medium-intensity generic west coast hop taste/aroma. Tastes like a mediocre craft beer from ten years ago.

Next up I'll be giving 2020 Citra a try, I hope it lives up to 2019 instead of being mediocre like this year's Mosaic. After that, 2020 El Dorado.

So I'm curious to see everyone throw out their experiences and see if there are any trends. Granted, there is probably big variety based on which harvest you're getting and how it is stored. I like to think that by ordering domestic hops in bulk from YVH I'm getting the best hops available to me as a homebrewer, but I don't really know if that's true.",Homebrewing

"Bummed out. Finally set up my kegerator and immediately had a huge failure. I got my cheap Home Depot fridge (Magic Chef 4.4 cubic ft fridge) set up as a kegerator. The door wouldn't quite close with 2 kegs, so I made a little grove where the protruding keg was by digging out some insulation and it was fine. I got both my taps on the door, the tubing all plugged in, so I was ready to go.

I had one keg of beer. I had pressure fermented in the keg, and it held pressure fine, so I knew the keg was good. This was my very first time with kegs and co2, so I was a bit nervous. I had the regulator hooked up to the tank and then to a manifold and then the keg. The valves on The regulator and manifold all closed. I release the co2 from the tank. Regulator gauges go up. spray everything with starsan. Looks good. Open regulator valve. Spray again. Looks good. Open manifold valve to keg. Now there's a loud hissing from the keg. Not feeling good about the sound, but my research told me there would be noise when the keg is carbonating. Spray everything again. Seems okay. Pull some beer from the tap. Comes out fine, but the beer is, of course, kind if flat. Still worried about the hissing, but tell myself I'm just overthinking it. Make sure psi is set where I want, then I close the fridge and walk away.

That evening I go to check on it. No more hissing = good sign? Pull on the tap. Not a drop. regulator gauges at zero. Pull on keg release  valve and there is zero pressure in the keg. Nothing at all. Wherever the leak was, it has to be in the keg, and big enough to empty a 5lb tank in a few hours. Did I not put the disconnect on right? Until I get more co2 I won't know, but it's such a disheartening mishap, especially for a beginner. Maybe my starsan was old and not bubbly enough to indicate leaks. Should I use soapy water?

"Delayed dry hopping in keg Hi

I might be brewing for an event in the coming year. I don't know how much free time I'll have for brewing, in the weeks and months leading up to said event. Therefore I was thinking about brewing the beers about 6 months in advance, and storing it in kegs. 

I wanted to brew 1 or 2 IPAs, but have read that the hop aroma might fade with time. I have also read about some guys dry hopping directly into the keg, using pellets in a hop bag. 

That got me thinking. 

I could postpone the dry hop until about a week before I need the beers. I would transfer the beer from one keg into another, that then contains the dry hop. I would probably have to do the transfer under pressure, but i don't think that should be at problem. 

Has anyone tried something similar? Or do you guys have any idea what to expect from this?

"Topaz Pale Ale Hey All,

I'm a strong advocate for using simple recipes for finding your best process and getting the most from your ingredients. And I just recently did  a 4.8% pale ale that utilized only Topaz hops because I wanted to get a better understanding of it!

Here's the recipe:

Grist

9.5lb or 4.3kg (78.3%) Bohemian Pilsner Malt (Weyermann)

1lb or 453g (8.7%) Munich I (Weyermann)

1.5lb or 680g (13%) White Wheat Malt (Proximity)

Mash @ 156degF or #nice degC for 1hr


60 min boil

0.75oz or 21g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) at 30min for 16IBU

4oz or 113g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) at flameout for 40IBU

3oz or 85g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) Dryhop post-fermentation


Yeast

I used Omega Yeast Labs OYL-009 West Coast Ale II, but they don't produce this yeast on a homebrew level anymore. You can use Wyeast 1272 for similar results. I love this yeast for highly-hopped beers because it's clean fermented at low temps (65degF/18degC) or amps up fruity hops with esters at higher (70degF/21degC). I went with the higher end for this beer because of the hop choice.

OG 13.2degP or 1.054sg

FG 4.3degP or 1.017sg

This beer was good. It had a fullness that the hops gave after dry hopping. I've found that a lot of Australian hops like this and Galaxy give a beer a much fuller feeling and flavor. The aroma was smaller I think from the ABV, but it was very tropical with mango, coconut, pineapple while also having a spicy character that reminded me of cinnamon or clove.

Overall, I really liked this hop as it had many flavors going on. However, I think it would be best utilized with another tropical/citrus hop like Citra or Centennial. Several descriptions of Topaz mentioned more lychee flavors at higher gravities, which I obviously didn't mess with. So that's another thing you could play with for this hop, just making this recipe and bumping up the gravity to a 7+%ABV beer.

I'm here for questions and would love comments if you have experience with this hop and how it may have been different.

Happy Brewing!",Homebrewing

I could then swap between two lines, one for blow-off during fermenting, and another that connects to my CO2 regulator for O2-free crash cooling and pressure transfers.

I've been looking around and I can't find the right equipment. If there were a 3"" TC lid with a keg post on it, that would be ideal. Anyone know what I'd need? /u/brulosopher do you remember what you used and where you found it? Thanks!",Homebrewing

"cold distill homemade mead after heating it Hello,

Sorry if it was already answered but i didn't find it so here goes:

I know that ethanol evaporates at 78¬∞ C/174¬∞F and methanol at 65 ¬∞C/148¬∞ F.  


Can i remove all the methanol by heating some homemade mead (or store bought wine) to 70¬∞ C on a regular open pot (so no condensation going back in) ?

If i then cold distill the result, can there be some residual methanol left (and so i should be careful when consuming it)?

"Stir bars in fermenters I was daydreaming about homebrewing and came up with a question I couldn't answer that I thought someone here might know.

I am setting up my starter, and 'best practice' suggests using a stir bar. My assumption is that this is to oxygenate the media and distribute the yeast. Why don't homebrewers or macro brewers use stir bars in fermenters for the same reasons? Wouldn't this also speed up brewing?

The only reason I can think of is that sometimes brewers are trying to get the off-flavors that come from slightly strained yeast. Any other thoughts?

"Holiday Brewing Plans Hi, r/homebrewing:

Homebrewing teacher here, and I'm looking forward to the much needed break coming up. I'll definitely be using some of my time off to brew, so I wanted to share my plans/recipes.

Ill be (hopefully) brewing 3 batches:

An extract version of a  Honey Patersbier recipe i made a few times:

3 lbs light DME
2 lbs wildflower honey
8oz biscuit malt
8oz honey malt
8oz Munich 10L malt

0.5oz nugget @ 45 minutes

WLP 570 Belgian Golden Ale (I usually use Imperial B63 Monastic but had to go with what my LHBS had).

A Rye Stout:

9 lbs 2-row
3 lbs Rye Malt
1 lbs flaked rye
12oz chocolate rye
8oz midnight wheat

For the hops, I'll probbaly use up some leftover Veterans blend or falconers flight I have, with additions at 60, 15, and FO. This could morph into a black IPA-ish beer as well. Shooting for around 40-50 IBUs. Fermented with US-05.

A kveik mexican ""lager:""

5 lbs 2-row
3 lbs flaked corn

0.2oz nugget @ 60 minutes, 0.5oz @ 5 minutes.

Omega Labs OYL 061 Voss Kveik.

"I may have mashed to high. What now? I started a Hefeweizen 2 days ago. After i added tilt hydrometer , i realized i had cooled way too much.... 52 deg F. Double checked the temp with a third thermometer and found it really was 52 deg. The first thermometer i had been using was off. 

Fermentation took off pretty quickly within 12 hrs and went from 1.056 to 1.035 over the next day. 

Today it sat at 1.035 all day. Airlock has been bubbling pretty quickly (few bubbles per second). But SG hasn‚Äôt budged. I even double checked with a standard hydrometer. 

So then i started rethinking things. I heat
my mash up with a digiboil; it does an okay job but i always double check it with another thermometer and it does occasionally overshoot the temp. 

I planned to mash at 154 (strike temp 160). It did overshoot to around 164 (according to digiboil). I took lid off and stirred a bit and let sit for 10-15 mins until the bad thermometer said 159 and then mashed in. So maybe it really wasn‚Äôt 159. The digiboil is usually correct within 5 deg.

"Recipe Brainstorming -- Orange Creamsicle ale? Forgive me in advance for my somewhat scattered thoughts here. This is pure brainstorming at this phase.

&amp;#x200B;

I've hit the the point in my brewing year where I'm ready to try something different and use up some of the supplies I have sitting in the freezer. I notice the pack of Voss Kviek. I notice the 2 oz of Pacifica hops. And the half pound of lactose left over from the lovely milk stout I brewed a couple months ago. And a pound of honey malt. Maybe some cyrstal malt for color?

Voss Kviek

2 oz Pacifica hops

1 lb of Honey Malt

.5 lb of lactose

The wheels are turning in my head. Assume target is a 5 or 5.5 gal batch

Can I make a decent creamsicle ale with this, on a backbone of Maris Otter pale malt? A lot of the creamsicle ale recipes I've seen are based on 6 row or 2 row, would the Maris Otter (which I understand is a 2 row derivative), so my guess is it shouldn't be too much of a stretch.

I'm assuming starting with 10-11 lbs of Maris Otter as the base

Is 1lb of honey malt too much? should I cut it to 8oz?

adding some orange peel late in the boil.

Possibly adding some vanilla, either after  few days of fermenting, or at bottling. I've got a bottle of sugar free torani vanilla syrup I grabbed on a whim from my LHBS, and I'm debating if this is worth using here, and if so, how much to try

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for thoughts on percentages. Are there other hops that I have on hand (Mt Hood, Kent Goldings, Newport, Fuggles) that would blend well with this, or should I just double-up on the Pacifica.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I plan on pitching the whole (11g) pack of voss kviek, or just half the package? I've read things about it performing very well when under-pitched at higher temps, but the package recommends .5 to 1g pitch per liter, so my guess is whole pack

Micro Matic looks to have the Premium Series (642) and Premium Plus Series (842) with the former having an adjustment knob and latter having a screw (not sure as it has a cap and there is very limited info).

"Urgent Siphoning Help!! Hey all,

I've done a little digging and can't seem to find an answer to this question. Hopefully this isn't redundant!

I recently started brewing my first batch of beer (Dry malt extract + cascade hops) but I've run into an issue. I fermented a 5 litre batch in a 30 litre fermenter (mistake #1) and I'm trying to siphon it now that the fermentation is complete. Unfortunately, my siphon is this annoying jiggle siphon ([Kegland siphon](https://www.kegland.com.au/plastic-jiggle-auto-siphon-racking-cane-with-vinyl-tube-10mmx14mmx1-4m.html) and I'm just not able to start the suction with it (probably because there's very little beer relative to my fermenter). In trying to get the siphoning started by doing the pump action, I've probably already aerated the shit it out of it and the sediment has definitely been disturbed. I don't have a way of getting a better siphon until mid next-week so I have a couple of options:

1. Pump even more and risk further aerating the beer to get a very slow siphon going. 

2. (My preference)  Close the lid of my fermzilla fermenter, let it sit in the closet for a few more days and then cold crash it again while I procure a better siphon. This will give a chance for the sediment to drop again. I'm just concerned about the aeration that has already happened.

Neither is ideal but since I've already opened my fermenter lid for 20-30 minutes, is it bad to close it and let it keep fermenting? Or is there pressure to bottle ASAP?

Also, given my siphon woes, I'm wary of siphoning into a bucket and then siphoning again into bottles. Are either of these a good idea?

1. Cold crash the beer again and throw in the priming sugar into the fermenter itself, mix it gently and then siphon immediately into bottles.

2. Meticulously split the priming sugar into all my bottles and siphon straight into the bottles.

"First Lager tastes a bit ... earthy ! Brewed my first lager two weeks back. Just plain, Munich, pilsner and some wheat malt.

"First time dry hopping - what to look out for? Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

tomorrow I'll be brewing a Black IPA that I am considering to dry hop. Given that I am still fairly new to homebrewing and haven't done that yet, I would like to get some advice. Say you could talk to yourself when you were first going to dry hop a beer, what would you tell yourself? What would you suggest to someone trying it for the first time? What to look out for?

&amp;#x200B;

Some details about the beer/recipe:

It will be a recreation of Clawhammer Supply's [Black IPA](https://www.clawhammersupply.com/blogs/moonshine-still-blog/how-to-brew-a-black-ipa-homebrew-beer-recipe). So that is

OG = 1.061

FG = 1.008

ABV = 6.96%

Volume = 5.3 gal

Malt:

* Pale Malt - 10lbs, 8.0 oz. (4kg 762.7g)
* Flaked Rye - 12.8 oz. (362.9g)
* Crystal 60 - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Crystal 120 - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Chocolate Wheat - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Carafa III - 6.4 oz. (181.4g)

Hops:

* Columbus¬†- 0.3 oz (8.5g) at 60 minutes
* Centennial - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at 45 minutes
* Centennial - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at¬†30 minutes
* Cascade - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at¬†15 minutes
* Cascade - 0.5 (14.17g) oz at 5 minutes

They mention that the beer is lacking hop aroma somewhat. So I was considering to add some (probably 1 oz) Galaxy hops to the hopstand. And then as mentioned before some dry hopping. I still have quite a bit of Citra hops in my storage, so I was planning to use those. I was considering to add some amount (something like 1.5 to 2 oz) after fermentation is mainly done and to leave them in for about 5 days.

Yeast:

* Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II)

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overdoing it with the 5 different hops for a black IPA? Are 1.5 to 2 ounces a reasonable amount for roughly 5 gallons in the dry hop?

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback is appreciated, thanks!",Homebrewing
"3-roller mill locks up, what to do? I assembled my crankandstein 3D mill yesterday (used, refurbished), and of course i wanted to test it.

I attached my cordless Bosch drill, put it in low RPM gear, poured some unmalted wheat in the hopper (all i had on hand and willing to waste) and started milling...for 2 seconds and then it just locked up and damn near threw itself off the table and sprained my wrist. 

I BIAB so i wanted to test it on the narrowest setting, but my drill (usually it's plenty powerful) just wasn't able to turn the rollers *at all*. Only somewhere in the middle setting was it possible, but then the unmalted wheat was almost as good as intact coming out of the mill. I've been running my old corona mill  just fine with this drill, on such a fine setting it was almost flour coming out

"Non distilled whisky approximation?  

Hi All,

I've been kicking around the idea of trying to homebrew something non distilled that would taste similar to whisky but I'm not sure how realistic this is. I found an old thread on a different website where a guy was trying for the same thing with a corn wine that was 80% corn 20% malt and he put oak chips in during secondary fermentation. He said it tasted good but wasn't like whisky at all really.

I'm thinking maybe 100% malt or rye and aged with oak maybe? Obviously the ABV will be a lot lower than whisky but I'm just aiming for flavor ballpark. Has anyone tried for something similar or have ideas other than distilling or adding a ton of still spirits whisky essence?",Homebrewing

"two water questions for y'all Two quick water questions I hope aren't too dumb that I hope you can help me with. I haven't really spent time with water issues before but am trying to learn more about it as a way to be more detailed with my beer.

1. Does a carbon filter remove brewing minerals like Ca, Mg, Na, SO4, Cl, and bicarbonate, or not? I usually run my water through a filter and am not sure what if anything I'm actually removing doing so.
2. In BeerSmith I took the water profile I got from the tap from my city (Los Angeles, specifically East Los Angeles) and entered it in, but something seems off. Given the mineral profile (expressed by the city as mg/L but that's basically ppm, yes?) the BeerSmith water analysis shows effective hardness as only 28 ppm. However, the city's chart has a hardness (called total hardness) that is substantially higher at around 115 mg/L. Is there a difference between ""total"" hardness and ""effective"" hardness that would account for the discrepancy? One difference is that BeerSmith shows Bicarbonate as HC03 while the city shows Bicarbonate and hardness as CaC03, so something may be different there? 

At some point I may start just buying RO water and building up from it, but would like to at least understand my tap water right now.

My wife encouraged me to get back into brewing again, and this time I wanted to make larger batches so a couple months ago I bought a Brew Demon catalyst kit with the 6.5 gallon fermenter.  It came with the Oktoberfest recipe.

I needed to buy a new pot to boil the malt in.  While looking for large stockpots, I found out that electric brew kettles exist.  Then I found out about all-in-one's that come with things like a grain basket and immersion chiller.

Since it was Black Friday, I figured why not take the opportunity to get a really nice one.  I got the Anvil 10.5 gallon and it came with the recirc pump free as part of the sale.

So now I have a 10.5 gallon, 220V kettle, with grain basket, immersion chiller, and a recirc pump.  To brew a recipe that comes with 6lbs of what looks like malt milkshake powder and 2 lbs of ""aromatic"" (sic) grain in sock.

Don't get me wrong this is a nice problem to have, but - my boiling setup is a bit overkill for the recipe ingredients I have.  It's unclear which brew kettle features I should *take out* for this run.  Do I leave off the recirculation pump (in case clumps of malt powder might clog it)?  Do I put the crushed grains directly in the grain basket, take out the grain basket to just use the sock, or maybe place the sock in the grain basket?

The instruction manual warns brew-in-a-bag grains might be too fine for the basket, but I'm unclear if this is equivalent to brew in a bag and I'm unclear what constitutes a fine grind.  The grains in the recipe kit seem to be all different sizes from cornmeal size to whole grains.  (Average is about cous cous size.)

Also the perforated disk which you're supposed to put over the grain basket when using the recirculation pump is on back-order, so I haven't gotten that yet; I do have the external pump itself.",Homebrewing
Wiring temp probes for electric brewing I'm wiring my existing 3 wire temp probe connection to a male 4 pin rtd. Instructions would lead me to believe I should have red wires on pins 1 and 3 and a white wire on pin 2 and nothing going to pin 4. Am I crazy or should is this standard procedure? I was led to this because I had a system with 3 pin rtd probes and connections but bought new kettles that had 4 pin temp probes. I thought I was on the right path but when I plugged everything in I had an error on my temp control display. Am I barking up the wrong tree here and just need to buy new 3 pin probes?,Homebrewing
"Sanitizing a spigot. Hi

"Can We Please Address This: Mash PH Temp Corrections and All Sorts of Confusion I am a lot of emotions right now.

Is mash PH the most mythical concept in homebrewing that we're all afraid to address? I've been doing a lot of research and get some conflicting answers everywhere I look. I have an Apera Instruments digital PH meter with ATC (automatic temperature control). 

From what I understand, **mash PH is lower at true mash temps (152F) than our collected sample cooled to room temp (65F).** Meaning to truly understand our hot mash PH, we need to correct for temp REGARDLESS if our PH meter has ATC functionality built-in. John Palmer suggests we should subtract 0.35 from our room temp PH reading to get our TRUE mash PH.

So if my room temp mash PH (taken at 65F) is 5.7, we must subtract 0.35 to get our actual mash PH of 5.35. **This is the number we actually want.**

**My process now is:**

1. I take my first mash PH reading after a 10-minute rest after mashing in.
2. I draw off a sample and let it cool to 60-70 degrees F.
3. I take a PH reading and let's say it 5.7.
4. I subtract 0.35 and determine mash PH is actually 5.35.
5. I celebrate and or make any acid adjustments from here if needed.

I'm assuming that ATC only helps us compensate for our room temp reading and it's not actually correcting for a true hot mash reading. If I were to take a direct PH reading in my hot mash with my digital meter I would 1. probably destroy the meter, and 2. get a truly accurate reading. Hooray.

Does this jive with what everyone else agrees on? Would love to argue about this.

"Ss Brew buckets with TC Hello,

I've been using Speidel fermenters for a long time, and I'm quite happy with them. I've modded my 12L and 30L to add a stainless steel thermowells and fitted a cap with a gas post in order to do closed transfers to kegs.

That being said, I've been looking into Ss Brew buckets for three reasons:

1. Stainless seems better and more resistant than plastic.
2. I expect it would hold pressure better than the Speidels, where even 1psi seems to leak depending on how the lid is sealed. 
3. I would like to add a TC port and a butterfly valve to the brew bucket so that I could flush my dry hop additions with CO2 using a diopter or similar.

I'm debating whether or not to silicone the edges.  I can think of arguments both ways.

"What causes DMS really A recent brew of mine had a strong off flavour that took me a bit to pin down.  It was my first DMS tinged beer.

The brew process wasn‚Äôt unusual: a 10L Irish red biab on a convection stove. 1 hour mash at 68C, 3:1 water to grain. Half arsed batch sparse because I actually had a touch too much grain and didn‚Äôt want to overshoot gravity. Hot liquor added up to the 10L and boiled for 1 hour. I chilled by putting the pot in a cold water filled sink, and running cold water in a silicone hose heat exchanger submerged in the wort, going from between 90 and 100 C to less that 30C in about half an hour.

Now, everyone will readily say the 2 causes of DMS flavour is the grain bill, chilling too slow and allowing more DMS to form after off-gassing it in the boil.

This is my first DMS experience, and my best chill. I usually chill slower by just sitting the pot in the sink alone, and at least twice have just dumped boiling wort into the ferment keg and sealed it, hosing the outside just until it‚Äôs safe to transport and just pitching the next day. I‚Äôve also heard of plenty of people never having issue with no-chill.

So what gives? Reading up on DMS seems pretty scientifically backed, but there is plenty of empirical evidence against the supposed causes.

Does anyone have advice or general insight on this one?",Homebrewing
"Did I oxidize my neipa??? Keg transfer went sideways Process was tight up until keg transfer. Big dry hop charge left significant amount of trub at bottom of fermonster, about halfway up the spigot.

"Mad Scientist or Lazy Brewer, Same Outcome TL/DR: I fermented an IPA from 1.070 SG to 1.007 SG in four days and am drinking on day six. 

Last Wednesday I brewed an IPA and today (Tuesday), I‚Äôm drinking it. I have been playing around with recipes for a strawberry milkshake IPA for a few months now. After mashing my grain (missed the target gravity, but I‚Äôm still learning a new system) I realized that I didn‚Äôt have the strawberries and decided to improvise. Long story short, I threw some mango pur√©e in my fermenter before transferring the wort over (I know you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to add the fruit at the tail end of fermentation) and transferred the wort at about 100F. Again playing the lazy brewer, I used the yeast I had on hand which was S-05 and pitched it hot, while the wort was transferring. I stored my fermenter in a bathtub that I know remains about 68F all day and heard nothing from the airlock after two days. On the third, I pitched another packet of S-05 thinking I had killed the first bunch. That was a waste because I took the gravity reading the next day after still hearing no activity from the airlock and I was below my predicted FG. Guess that lid doesn‚Äôt seal fully. Cold crashed yesterday, kegged last night and poured the first pint tonight. This is why I enjoy brewing, the experimentation and pushing the limits. 

Recipe for those interested (5G batch):

9 lb golden promise
2 lb oat malt
2 lb wheat malt
1 lb honey malt
0.5 lb cara dextrin (leftover so I just tossed it in)
1 oz Columbus (60 minutes)
1 oz Centennial (20 min whirlpool at 150F)
2 oz Hull Melon (20 minute whirlpool at 150F)
1 oz Hull Melon (24 hour dry hop)
32 oz Mango pur√©e 
1 pkg SafAle S-05

Lessons learned:
- I can go from brew day to brew in hand in six days
- Not everything that is held as true in the brew community is actual Truth, it‚Äôs just the way it has been done thus far
- Yeast is hearty and will tend to surprise you
- Don‚Äôt always trust the airlock, measure gravity when in doubt",Homebrewing
"Bock Recipe Input Hey all I am pretty new to all grain recipes (I've done a few but want to nail this one) and I was hoping you could point out any flaws in my recipe. One thing that was weird researching Bocks was that some recipes used all Munich and some did a split of Vienna and Munich. I went on the more conservative side and used Vienna to hopefully keep that malt and biscuit character without the mash sucking in performance. 

Grain Bill: 

* 6.5 lbs Vienna Malt
* 3.25 lbs Munich 20L Malt
* 3.75 lbs Boneland Munich Malt
* 2 Oz Carafa (for color)
*1.6 oz Hallertau (4.5%) for one hour
*Wyeast 2026

Target OG of 1.066 (based on past experience with bigger bill beers) and FG around 1.015. ABV of 7.0. The SRM in brewtarget is 17.1 with 23-24 IBUs

Mash: 

* Protein rest at 122F for 30 minutes 
* Mash at 155F for 60 minutes

"IPA Method Questions Ok so I've made two IPAs now, both from different recipes, but both have the same ""flaw"". They're not bad beers, but neither have a ton of hop aroma and they're both quite bitter.

Question 2 - When dry hopping do you just throw the pellets into the fermentor or should they be captured in a muslin bag or something?

"Fermenting under pressure Hi all,

Relative newbie trying to understand carbonation options. I was considering a FermZilla because you can ferment under pressure. In the videos I've seen of this, though, the transfer was to a keg.

"Next step guidance Hello all,

I have made 4 of the five gallon Northern Brewer batches.  Three were straight forward, the fourth needed a secondary fermenter.  I have two more batches to make, because I need practice drinking!  After the first batch I decided my stove didn't have enough ass to heat efficiently, and an ice bath in my sink was equally inefficient.  I've upgraded to a stand alone propane burner, and I have an immersion chiller that I couple with the ice bath.

I'm now soliciting you all for ideas to perfect my craft, my end results, or recommendations on the next step to delve deeper into home brewing.

I'm considering getting an air stone and medical grade O2 instead of sloshing around the fermenting bucket.  I'm also considering getting a glass beaker, shake plate to prepare yeast in advance.  So if I go this route specifically, will these measures improve clarity?  In my novice mind, they would only speed up the fermentation process.  I'd greatly appreciate that, but if the recipe calls for two weeks in the fermenter bucket, how will I know when I can bottle?  Am I risking ruining the batch if I bottle earlier than the instructed two weeks?  Am I risking ruining the batch if I speed up fermentation, then leave it for two weeks?

Next, the Kolsch I prepared called for two additional weeks in a secondary fermenter.  When I moved the five gallon batch from the plastic primary fermenter to the glass carboy there was a good amount of air (maybe five inches) at the top.  How bad is this for oxidizing, creating off flavors?  Any suggestions to overcome this issue?

Any specific or general advice or words of wisdom is greatly appreciated.

In case you need to know I don't have any crazy equipment on hand:
1 Edelmetall propane burner
2 plastic five gallon fermenter buckets
2 plastic five gallon bottling buckets
2 glass five gallon carboys
thermometer
manual capper
racking canes

"Heads up to Brewfather users using no sparge equipment profiles A couple days ago I opened a recipe I was working on the previous day, and I noticed the calculated mash water volume had dropped by ~1/3 of a gallon.  At first I thought I was just misremembering, but I had also filled it out in a Bru'n Water spreadsheet.  I went back through old recipes and checked against my logs, and most had changed.

Some digging around in the [changelog](https://docs.brewfather.app/changelog#2-5-0-09-12-2020) and under Fixed I found:

&gt; Now using cold boil volume rater than hot (including expansion) when calculating water for ""No Sparge"" water calculation method, this will reduce the total water calculated by 4%, you might want to increase the grain absorption rate to compensate

I did the math by hand and confirmed that it was indeed doing that.  Further digging around, I found [this post](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/brewfather-water-needed-for-batch.686474/#post-9017770) with more info, and with a response by Brewfather's creator.

So, if your current no sparge equipment profile has been tuned so your pre-boil volume is correct, be advised that you may need to adjust it.

As a side note, I was a bit confused because the incorrect calculations had seemed to be working for me.  I had imported all my recipes from Beersmith, and the water volumes all lined up, so I never really looked further.  But, looking again, I notice that the default grain absorption in Brewfather (.383 qt./lb.) is different than the default in Beersmith (.96 fl.oz./oz., or .48 qt./lb.), and the latter is closer to what I observe.  It just so happens that the different grain absorption plus the off-by-4% error almost exactly canceled each other out.",Homebrewing

"Life with Kveik Hi everyone. A year now I have been brewing with kveik and it's hard to look back. In this post I just wanted to share with you my cold side schedule for a typical brew with dry hopping.

- Pitch Yeast
- See first bubbles 30min after pitching (this depends on various factors but wont be higher than 2-3 hours) 
- Reach FG after 20-24 hours (higher OG takes a bit longer)
- Dry hop 48 hours after pitching
- Bottle on day 5-6
- Conditioning... (To my experience this takes 2-3 weeks and its the only thing that it is common to other yeasts)

I guess you I could bottle even sooner especially if not dry hopping but since I usually brew on weekends I bottle on the next weekend. But even with this schedule is a week shorter than my typical schedule with a standard yeast. 

Keep in mind that this schedule is typical for Voss, I have found that other Kveiks are also fast but may take few more Hours to reach FG.

Kveik definitely was a game changer for me as I am able to brew more often, experiment more, brew small batches. I used to have 2-3 different beers max in my cellar and with my latest brew I count 9 different beers.

I am not saying everyone should move to kveik, there are definitely more than few beers that cant be brewed with Kveik, but I strongly encourage every homebrewer just to give it a try.

Bring 1 gallon of RO (or distilled) water to a boil. Dissolve the brewing minerals except for chalk and citric acid. Add 4 lbs of corn sugar. After boiling for 5 minutes, add 1/4 oz of Citra hops. Boil for 5 minutes.

Flameout and add 1/4 oz of Lemondrop hops. Chill to 170 and try to hold it there for ~10 minutes.

Add the gallon of hot water to 4 additional gallons of cold water (result should be 70F final temp) and add 1/4oz Mandarina Bavaria hops (in a nylon sack). Add the chalk and enough citric acid to get to a ph of 5.6.

Oxygenate and pitch champagne yeast. Ferment until completely dry. Rack to the serving keg and add another 1/4oz of Mandarina Bavaria (still in a sack). Carbonate to 3.2 volumes.

"Bootleg Biology NEEPAH Blend and Classic New England (BETA) Comparison With Bootleg Biology back in stock and releasing more strains today, I thought I would share some quick feedback. Last release, I ordered a pack of their NEEPAH Blend and Classic New England. I didn't intend on doing any direct comparisons, but I've used these strains on my last two brews with the same grain bill and hopping amounts/schedule, so this became an opportunity for a comparison of attenuation and appearance.

5.5 gal batches. Grists were 72% pale malt, 21% wheat malt, and 7% flaked oats. 5 oz. hops on the hot side, 5 oz. on the cold side with two additions: 1st at high krausen and a 2nd for 24 hours at 36F. Fermented at 64-66F, then bumped to 72F.

The NEEPAH Blend beer dropped from 1.064 to 1.014 (78% apparent attenuation) and the Classic New England Beer dropped from 1.064 to 1.010 (84% apparent attenuation). Both beers had a haze that was typical to other strains I've used for NE styles, but the NEEPAH Blend seems to be a bit brighter around the edges. The NEEPAH beer was brewed two weeks before the Classic New England, so this could be a factor, as it's had two weeks longer in the keezer, but the color differences were minimal. The main thing that stood out here was the difference in attenuation, especially the high attenuation of the Classic strain.

"Early racking to secondary. Hi,

So I know that many of us just skip the secondary. But for now I only own 1 conical that give me the ability to control my temperature (heating+cooling). Recently, I have been doing a early transfer 1 or two day after i reached final gravity to a second keg for clearing up the beer. If I make sure fementation is done and fg is reached is there any issue to transfering early to a keg (filled with co2)  to free my conical for another batch, or i will get better result to keep everything in primary ?

"Caramel in American IPA's Right, so I am trying to perfect my American IPA recipe. 

For my grain bill, I am currently using about 80 % pilsner malt and 20 % pale ale malt such as just a regular one or Golden Promise / Maris Otter variant. The beer is approx. 6 % ABV.

I recently purchased a copy of Brew Your Own's IPA style guide and was surprised to notice **every** American IPA recipe has a considerable amount of *caramel malt* in it. For my recipe, I do not wish for any more sweet or caramel flavors in order to get the beer as drinkable as possible - using something like the chico strain and American hops give the impression of sweet anyways. I mash at 65 degrees C (about 150 Fahrenheit) for a decent degree of fermentability and ferment on the lower end of the yeast's recommended temperature range in order to discourage ester production.

In the end, my beer turns out about as sweet as commercial examples go.

Among others, I believe the guys at Genus Brewing agree with me that caramel malts are best left in the bin when brewing an American IPA. I find the contradiction with Brew Your Own and several pro craft brewers interesting.

I am confused as of the purpose of caramel malt in the American IPA style and hence am reaching out to you; please give your opinions concerning the use of caramel malt in American IPA's; I am either looking to strengthen my views on forgetting caramel malts with the style OR someone to put me on the right track and turn my head towards putting 10  % of caramel 60 in my kettle.

"Odd gravity readings... During a ""large"" batch Farm house Saison of about 6 gallons, I took three hydrometer readings labeled ""Pre-boil"", ""Post-boil"", and ""OG"" (to show gravity when I pitched the yeast). What was odd about the readings was that the earlier gravity was higher than the latter. I was under the impression that the gravity would at least increase slightly Post-boil. The Pre-boil gravity showed 1.054 at 60\*F at the meniscus of the hydrometer, and 1.052 at the same temp for the Post and OG. My Pre-boil volume was at 6.5 gallons boiled down to 6 gallons. I did have to add a 1/2 gallon to compensate boiling below target volume.

So -0.002 isn't much of a difference, and I'm not complaining about it. I just wanted to know if its simply variation in my readings, or if its a matter of brew efficiency. Idk...

"Any flaw in process making my beer turn out the same? Sorry if this is too long.  I don't brew very often but when I do they turn out same. Slightly unpleasant but drinkable. My oktoberfest, brown ale, porter, Vienna lager, all tasted the same. My blonde ale, pale ale, tasted similar to the darker styles but masked by more hops. My neipa was okay but oxidised quickly. The only really good one I made was a Helles. From extract to all grain I've had this problem, and before and after controlling my temp.

Heres my process for a 2.5 gallon to 3 gallon batch

1. Heat up water to strike temp. Adjust water to add more calcium to my local water.  Pour in grains and stir.

2. Mash usually an hour at the temp in 

3. Batch sparge with 170 degree water. Drain roughly 4.25 gallons into kettle

4. Boil 60 min on stove on high. (Am I burning it? If I change it less than high it doesn't look like it's boiling though). Add bittering hops at beginning and later hops around 15 min or less depending on recipe of course.

5. Previously I'd chill using an ice bath, but more recently I'd use a  wort chiller (put in during boil to sanitize) with recirculating ice water in the sink. Stir occasionally to speed up chilling.

6.transfer to 3 gallon carboy. Aerate by splashing and shaking. (I got an aquarium pump but only used it once).

7. Since its &lt; 3 gal I think I can get away with 1 packet dry yeast, maybe 1 liquid yeast. I usually check a pitch rate calc to be sure and use 2 liquid if it says so. I've used American Ale, American Ale II, us-05, an English strain but not sure which, Scottish Ale, 34/70

8. Ferment 2-3 weeks in mid 60s with probe in thermowell. Lower if it's a lager. 

9. Used to bottle: transfer to bucket. Boil sugar in cup of water add an stir in as bucket is filling. Fill sanitized bottle then a friend caps it immediately. Kegging I sanitize 2.5 gallon keg. Use CO2 to pump sanitizer out, fill, purge headspace, burst carb.",Homebrewing

"My oxygen-free fermenter/bottling bucket I just want to share an alternative to fermenting in kegs. I don‚Äôt have fridge space for cronies in my apartment and still wanted some of the advantages of fermenting in kegs. I use 5 gallon buckets for 3-4 gallon batches. For my bucket lids, I‚Äôve added a thermowell, ball lock gas post and an 1.25‚Äù hole. Overall I think most of the advantages  of corny fermenter, such as positive pressure dry hopping and close transfer, can be had with buckets. Also, I top crop whenever the yeast allows it and fermenting in bucket makes that super easy.

Fermenting: heating pads are used with probe in the thermowell. I use 3 piece airlock with #7 stopper in the accessory hole. For cooling, a stainless loop can be easily added.

Dry hopping: Can be done easily through the accessory hole. I apply positive pressure and flush with CO2 from the ball lock post if I‚Äôm dry hopping after fermentation has slowed down.

Cold crashing: I switch to a solid bung and apply light pressure to the bucket with co2 before throwing the entire bucket in kitchen fridge.

Priming: After making sure the beer has completely chilled. This should take around 24 hours. I add priming solution through accessory hole/ball lock post depending on how lazy I feel.

"Temp Controlled Induction Brutus 20  [https://imgur.com/sBI9V2B](https://imgur.com/sBI9V2B)

I really enjoy this brew method.  The guys at Alenuts is where I first ran into it.  They have a real nice write-up (I'm assuming they dreamt up the method):

[http://alenuts.com/Alenuts/brutus20.html](http://alenuts.com/Alenuts/brutus20.html)

It's a two pot, two heat source, cross recirculation set-up.  The method was an effort to simplify from a 3 pot setup, provide clear wort into the BK, and not have the pH issues of fly sparging.  

My setup has a mashtun is on an 1800W induction cooker run by an external temperature controller.  The BK is on a 3500W induction cooker.  Two pumps required, or you can get by with one pump but you need a two tier brewstand so that the second pot can gravity feed back to the first. 

I used this brew method years ago with a RIMs tube and an induction cooker, until the RIMS tube controller died.  Then I just went full volume BIAB on the 3500W induction cooker.  I've always been a fan of induction.  No heating element touching my wart.  No risk of scorching.  Very simple cleanup.  

A while ago, I learned of Adcraft making true manual control induction cooktops that could be actuated from an external controller.  It's the one on the left in my pic.  It's 1800W 110V. They also have a  3000W 208V version.  I'm running my 1800W version with an Anvil temp controller ($25):

[https://www.anvilbrewing.com/-p/anv-temp-controller.htm](https://www.anvilbrewing.com/-p/anv-temp-controller.htm)

Super simple setup.  

I brew 4 gallon batches so I'm only using two of the $25 5-gallon stainless pots, which are induction capable (obviously).   

Pumps are the tan solar pumps.  They throttle flow rate real nice with just the valves on the pot.  

Basic brew process is:

1. Set both pots up to self-recirculate and heat MT to strike temp and BK to mash out temp (oddly enough, the onboard temp controller of the 3500W cooker will heat to around 167F when set to 150F).
2. Mash for 45 minutes while recirculating and the Adcraft maintains mash temp with +/-1F.  I mash in a bag and use a fine crush to speed conversion and you'll never have a stuck mash with a bag.
3. Start to cross recirculate at just a trickle, set temp controller to mash out temp and let it go until both pots reach temperature equilibrium at mash out temp.  This takes 15-20 minutes.
4. Shut-off BK pump and watch as pump from the MT slowly fills the BK with clear beer.  It's a beautiful sight.  The pic is of a brown porter that I just ran this morning.  

I'll get some pics up of the inside of the pots.  Thermowells and drain ports are as low in the pot as I could get them.  The MT has as domed false bottom with center pickup.  The BK has a brewhardware recirc port for whirlpool at cooling.  

What I love about it is (1) the simplicity of induction, (2) the beauty of that crystal clear wort trickling into the BK.  The fact that the mash temp is controller by two off the shelf products is icing on the cake.",Homebrewing

"Unconventional RIMS? I am happy with my new setup in the basement. 3500w induction burner, 10gal Anvil kettle, BIAB. I've had 2 great brews so far, but I'm reading more and more about the power of RIMS. All setups I've seen/read about have a PID controller and heat stick to heat wort during recirculation, but what if I tried something else?

I was thinking that I could put the induction burner on the lowest setting so there's a little heat being added to the kettle below the grain bag and false bottom (false bottom to keep the bag off the kettle bottom). Then simply pump the slightly-hotter wort to the top until the temp levels out where I want and manually turn the burner and pump off. Seems like the temp would normalize at the temp I want as I monitor it, and I manually control stabilizing mash temp or getting to the next step in the step mash.

"Will a Moldy Bottle Be Obvious? I was bottling some cider yesterday, and when I peeked into one of the bottles I was going to use during sanitation I saw mold growing in the bottom of the bottle. ""Gross! Well, I'm not using this one.""

If I had not looked carefully into the bottle, I would have sanitized it, filled it with cider, and capped it. And now I'm paranoid that somewhere in the last few batches I put cider in a moldy bottle. I'm usually very careful and use bottles that have been recently cleaned, but if it almost happened today, has it already happened before?

My question: If I use a moldy bottle when bottling cider, will it be obvious either before or after I open it? Will it stink when opened? Will it obviously taste moldy? Would I be able to see something in the bottle if I shine a light through it? I checked all my bottles with a flashlight for weird growths, but didn't see anything. All the sediment layers looked healthy and uniform in thickness.

"Newbie Questions Yesterday I completed my 3rd all-grain brew and my first 5 gallon batch with new equipment. I had some problems and I would appreciate some feedback for next time. Here were my steps:

1) Mash temp was 148F, which I hit, but after 20 min it went down to 146F so I added hot water. Then after 20 more min it went down to 146F again and I added hot water. I ended up adding about 3qts additional water in total. Is this correct or should I have just let it be even if it went down below 146?

2) I couldn't get temp up to 168F for Mashout. I added almost 3 gallons of near boiling water and only reached 165F. Is it bad that I didn't hit 168F? Do I really need to add 4gallons to Mashout? I ended up with 9gallons in the mash tun before sparging. This seems like alot. 

3) I recirculated for 15 minutes. The wort was better but still not completely free of stuff. SHould I have kept going? Is there diminishing returns after a certain point?

4) This was my first time fly sparging. I think it went ok. It took about 30 min to fill the brewpot to 6.25g. However, from what I have read online, when regulating the rate, I should keep the level of the water about an inch above the grainbed. I couldn't even see the grainbed, which makes me think I had too much water from trying to mashout. 

5) After I was finished sparging there was still 7 gallons still left in the mash tun. Is this normal or should most of it been drained into the brewpot?

6) My biggest issue was the boil. With 6gallons, I could only reach 208F, which held steady. It was boiling but it was not vigorous. I boiled off about 0.55g in one hour. 

7) During chilling, I had to stop at 140F and add glucoamylase. I stopped right at 140, but then it continued to cool down to about 125 almost immediately. When I added the packet, it all kind of clumped up. I stirred in the best I could. 

8) I usually just dump in a packet of dry yeast. This time I rehydrated first in some boiled and cooled water. The consistency was kind of gummy and strange.

9) The recipe shows an OG of 1.050. I hit 1.039. What does this mean? Do I still use the target FG of 1.000 or do I adjust?

10) And one other thing... I opened my beer from my second brew yesterday, and like my first batch, it is flat. No bite to it and and no head when poured into a glass. What is causing this?!

"[Update] Batch Rescured [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/k51des/rescue_a_sour_batch/)

TL;DR of OP - batch had a sour taste. Wanted advice around whether it was infection, whether to throw it out.

Thanks to advice from u/Neuroplasm that the taste could be indicative or a fermenting problem, I checked my notes and found that I fermented it way too cold. Pulled the keg out of the kegerator for a few days, used the purge valve to make sure it was actually fermenting. I assumed at first it was just the CO2 separating from the liquid as it warmed up. But after a few days, those purges had less and less of the sour smell, and eventually stopped altogether.

Popped it back in the kegerator, re-carbonated, and the batch is rescued. It is by no means one of my best beers, but it's (very) drinkable and will keep me going until the two batches I've got brewing at the moment are ready for Christmas.

"How does my ""Will it Beer?"" inspired recipe sound? So I recently saw the ""Will it Beer?"" breakfast beer post here, and have since watched the entire series. Loved it. Really opened my mind to some of the crazy possibilities brewing has to offer. And I thought, I'm going to try my own weird ingredient addition. I was drinking Crane Brewing's Apple Spice Gose at the time and thought, why not try apple pie!

I discussed it with a friend and she recommended a stout due to some of the dairy flavors that will be present in the crust. I'm not the hugest fan out stouts, but I drink them occasionally. 5 gallons of stout would take me years to get through. So I'm going to stick with sour and hope it works out. But I was browsing recipes and two apple pies stuck out to me: a caramel apple pie and a bourbon apple pie. So I decided to make a beer joining those styles. Here's the plan:

70% pilsner / 20% white wheat / 10% caramel malt

Caramel malt should be enough to affect the color and give a caramel taste without being overpowering. But I'm going to mash apple pie in with the beer for those apple and cinnamon flavors. I'm adjusting the recipe to include a graham cracker crust so there's less dairy involved. Apple pie recipe calls for both brown and white sugar, so I aimed for a lower OG from grains to account for the probably dramatic increase I'll see from the apple pie. Hoping it's mostly fermentable so I'm not left with an overpoweringly sweet beer.

Will kettle sour with mango GoodBelly drink. No hops. I'm going to use OYL Kveik to ferment since I love kveik yeasts and I think with all the added flavors, I'm not going to get much of a yeast profile anyway.

Then after fermentation stabilizes, I'm going to add 1oz of oak cubes soaked in Jack Daniels (I know not technically bourbon, sue me).

At the end of the day, if it sucks, I'll have had fun and there's always RDWHAHB.

"Question about yeast attenuation and temp control So since I moved my brewing in to the mud room I have intentionally restricted myself to brewing lagers in the winter and ales in the summer to help with temp control for the yeast.

Well this year due to covid scheduling and struggles coupled with limited Brew supply access etc I didn't get around to brewing my darker beers until November. Long story short, I have an imperial pumpkin porter using 1098 british ale yeast that I pitched at 70* but has pretty much spent the past 3 weeks 60*.

Would slowly raising the temp be an ok thing to do this late in the process or should I just wait it out for a few more weeks?

"27 gallon MoreBeer Conical Fermenter I have been using two of these fermenters for about 5 years. One has the heating and cooling mods and the other is bare and lives in my fermentation chamber.

"HBS grain crush Hey there
Here‚Äôs my question: I‚Äôve tried 3 different LHBS by now and it just seems to be me that their crushed grain isn‚Äôt that crushed after all.

I brew a lot of German styles, and I [use Sauergut to adjust the pH of the mash and at the end of the boil](https://www.themodernbrewhouse.com/a-sauergut-reactor/). Here's a process I've honed over the years for making small batches of it with little fuss.

1.	Make a full batch of wort using your usual techniques. We‚Äôll split up this batch for making small batches of Sauergut. If you‚Äôre a low-oxygen brewer, I don‚Äôt recommend using sulfites for this batch‚Äîthere won‚Äôt be an oxygenation step later to use up any of the excess. Once you hit mash-out, acidify down to pH 4.0-4.3 to avoid undesirable microbes. No need to boil. Drain into pouches (1.5 L each, in my case), squeeze all the air out, and freeze.
2.	A week before brewing a beer in which you want to use ‚ÄòGut, pull a pouch out of the freezer to thaw.
3.	One week to one day before dough-in, add Pilsner malt to the pouch (30 g, in my case) to inoculate with Lactobacillus. Squeeze all the air out of the pouch, and cap. Sous-vide at 118.5¬∫F until you need the ‚ÄòGut. Acidity should be around 1.8-2.0%. I used to let these sour for just 24 hours, but I‚Äôve found I more consistently get the desired acidity level the longer they go.
4.	Add ‚ÄòGut as needed at dough-in and end of boil.

I use [these pouches](https://www.etsy.com/listing/646515773/pack-of-50-top-corner-screw-cap-plastic). Careful: this seller shorted me ten pouches on my order. They eventually corrected the mistake by refunding the cost of the missing ones, but it was a bit of a hassle as I had to send them photos of what I‚Äôd received, etc. Still, the pouches are of high quality and seem to handle the freezing temperatures and the heat well.",Homebrewing

"Making a margarita beer? I  want to make a beer that has some resemblance to a margarita, at least  having a balanced mix of flavours between the lime, salt, agave and orange liquor.

Maybe some agave syrup to get the agave taste (altho this can be hard to find  in my country, so perhaps just pouring a very small amount of tequila after fermentation could work???).

Citrus hops for the lime flavour could work and I have some already.

"Saving undercarbonated beer I've been successfully carbonating all my brews using sugar and priming calculators (I bottle all brews) but recently got some carbonation drops in anticipation of brewing a NEIPA to reduce oxidation. 

They arrived before I bottled the ESB I had brewed so decided to practice using them and bottling straight from the primary fermenter. They were the mangrove jack drops and instructions were for one per 375ml bottle or two for 750ml (think they're Antipodean and those are the standard sizes there). I bottle in 500ml and so after a quick search read one should still be fine, especially as I was bottling a style usually served from cask.

Anyway, fast forward to two weeks of bottle conditioning and there is fuck all carbonation. I presume it's not going to improve from this point so I was wondering are there any negatives (beyond potential oxidation) to opening the bottles, adding another drop and recapping? I'm not too worried about the oxidation, I'm just not excited to have 30+ bottles of flat beer.

At least I know to use 2 per bottle for my NEIPA now. If it helps at all, it's the first time I've used anything but US-05, instead using S-04. But it's a low ABV beer so I can't see why there wouldn't be adequate yeast to feast on the sugar.",Homebrewing

"Anyone brew with wild grains/ingredients? One thing that led me to brewing was the idea of using and preserving things that my partner and I grow in our garden, or forage from the wild. Of course, I fell down the homebrewing rabbit hole and at this point 99% of my ingredients come from the LHBS. But I am definitely interested in using homegrown and foraged ingredients more, at least once the long cold Alaskan winter is over up here. In fact, I have this fantasy about eventually being able to make FREE beer, so I'm always looking for new things I can harvest instead of buying. 

**Does anyone have any favorite ingredients, that you grow yourself or like to forage? How do you go about including them in your home brew recipes?**

I've had really good luck with pureeing our wild and cultivated berries. My first couple of batches of homebrew were made for this purpose -- too many berries to freeze, can, etc. before they go bad! -- and I got started homebrewing by making easy cheesy DME batches and mixing the fruit into the primary. It made kind of a hybrid beer-wine. My partner definitely loved it! And adding puree to the primary is, I discovered, the trick to getting a fun color in your beer. The crowberry wheat I made this fall was dark purple! I know a lot of people really struggle to impart a fruit color in their beer, but that seems to be the ticket. 

At one point I had this fantasy of using wild grains. Wild rye and foxtail barley are prolific here and I started foraging them, but man, it seems like a ton of work to get a usable quantity -- especially since the wild varieties don't seem to have the big, plump grains that the domesticated species do. 

I've also been experimenting with malting local-grown barley, but in Alaska few (if any) farmers are growing malting two-row and it has been a painstaking (and ongoing) process to get the local six-row to germinate and modify evenly. Thus, I'm thinking of trying sow a legitimate small farm plot of grains this spring -- malting varieties of 2-row and 6-row, plus wheat, oats, triticale, and buckwheat -- along with several hops bines. 

Finally, what about herbs, adjuncts, and alternative ingredients? I know spruce tips have been a historical brewing ingredient -- my local LHBS even sells them -- so this spring I hope to find some spruce trees that haven't been killed by beetles, and use them. Last fall, I picked the nasturtium flowers and young leaves from our garden before the frost, and dehydrated them, but now I am not sure what I want to do with them. Also, our property has a ton of birch trees on it and I would really like to tap a few for birch syrup. Does anyone else like to brew with these types of ingredients?

"Lionshead Lager ‚Äì A Smoked Red Lager Made with Home-Smoked Malt [https://imgur.com/M30jF7m](https://imgur.com/M30jF7m)

Full blog post and recipe here: [https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2020/12/11/lionshead-lager-smoked-red-x/](https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2020/12/11/lionshead-lager-smoked-red-x/)

So, the story behind this one is pretty simple:

1. I'm a homebrewer.
2. We won a Traeger.
3. Yes, I love BBQ, but what I REALLY want to do is make a smoked beer.

This is the result: a malty, moderately smoky lager made with 50% home-smoked Red X malt. It went far better than I expected, especially given I don't particularly love smoked beer. If you have or have access to a smoker, I highly recommend trying it!

**Beer recipe (4 gal):**

* 3.5# Best Malz Red X (cherrywood-smoked)
* 2.5# Best Malz Red X (unsmoked)
* 1# Best Malz Pilsen
* 15g Loral (10.5% AA) @ 60min
* 15g Loral @ 5min
* 1.5L starter of Saflager W-34/70
* Procedure: Mash at 152 for 75min, boil 60 min, chill to 50F, pitch yeast, ferment until nearly finished and then d-rest at 60F for a couple days. Crash gradually to 34F and lager for 4-6 weeks before serving.

**Smoking the malt:**

1. Wet the grain, using about a half cup of water per pound of malt.
2. Set your smoker to its lowest temp setting and get a good smoke going.
3. Spread the moistened malt on some baking sheets and put them directly on the smoker grate. (Fine-mesh chicken wire would work better here, I just didn't have any.)
4. Fill a spray bottle with more water and mist the malt every 20 minutes, turning it to ensure coverage.
5. Smoke for a total of 4 hours, or until grain tastes appropriately smoky.
6. Once grain is tasting good, transfer cookie sheets to an oven set to the lowest temp (170F) and dry to near original moisture content.
7. Set smoked grain in a paper bag to off-gas for a few days before use.

**Note:** This was also the first beer I made with a CBDS floating dip tube and a spunding valve, which let me ferment and serve in the same keg. It worked phenomenally well, and I think it was a big contributor to this being one of the best beers I've made to date.",Homebrewing

"Howto: converting shanks with hardcoded barbs to Duotight compatible tl;dr cut most of the barb off, then drill with a counterbore bit for cleanup (the second step wasn't obvious at least to me)

pictures: https://imgur.com/a/E7jNtLP

I decided I want to build my new keezer entirely with quick disconnect tubing on the liquid side.  I bought two Duotight/Intertap shanks for testing, but they turned out to be rubbish, since they fit only Intertaps (not Perlicks) and the pour is ridiculously crappy for high-carb beers, as in ""enjoy your glass of foam""-crappy.  I cut the barb off of one of my old shanks with an angle grinder for testing, and spent ages cleaning the burrs with a dremel.  It poured a high-carb high-wheat saison like a dream, so I decided to convert the rest of my shanks.  After a lot of cleanup with the dremel, I still wasn't happy with the lips.  The rough cut had worked in the prototype, but I was worried it would accumulate gunk in long-term service, plus it's unlikely to improve the pour.

I was planning to manually sand/file the lip off -- talk about a labor of hate -- but after weeks of putting off it occurred to me that I could drill the hole clean.  I bolted the shank to a block of wood with two standard shank bolts to hold the shank steady, the bottom side bolt recessed into the block.  The hole in my drill press table is just big enough to hold the shank with some cushioning paper wrapped around, so I didn't need a more complex holding device.  I drilled until I couldn't feel the lip with my fingernail.

I'm quite happy with the result.  It took several weeks of procrastinating, at least an hour of dremel frustration, several hours of shopping to figure out the right bit, and finally a few minutes of doing.  I used the 12.4mm Bohrcraft cobalt countersink (1710 series); not sure if a cheaper bit would've worked -- I don't have much metalworking experience -- but I wanted to err on the side of too good at the cost of a few bucks, as I wasn't interested in doing cleanup for the cleanup's cleanup.

Hope this helps someone to convert their shanks.  It's really just a few-minute job (plus time required for taking the old ones out, cleaning the cutting oil off with TSP afterwards, re-building, etc.).  Obviously, the conversion works only for stainless steel shanks, not chrome-plated ones.  Also noteworthy, and something that I didn't think of in advance: the stunt makes the shank ""shorter"" since the Duotight fitting needs to screw on, so make sure it's a long enough shank or that you have a way to drill a recess for the Duotight fitting.",Homebrewing

Temp difference in mash I do BIAB so I mash in my boil kettle. Lately I've noticed a huge difference between the temperature in the middle of the kettle and around the sides.

Its making it difficult for me to be certain I'm actually mashing at my target temperature and I'm betting that low temps in a big portion of the mash (low as in below 140) is a big part of why my gravity has been off so often,Homebrewing

"Wind Malt / Jovaru Mixed Ferm My Reddit app was glitching all day after I posted this so I took it down and am re-posting. 

I brewed a beer yesterday that I‚Äôll be racking into mulberries and pitching a undecided brett strain into. 

Exact recipe is in photos. 

Wind Malt, wheat, oats and rye. Wind Malt has almost no color and is lighter than wheat malt in SRM and needs some step mashed but has more enzymatic power than any other malt that I‚Äôm aware of due to it not being kilned. It‚Äôs dried via the sun/wind. 

I did a 20 min mash at 134*f, stepped up to 158*f then did a 15 min decoction to add color and melanoidin to the beer. In my opinion it worked beautifully, the wort came out looking like honey. 

I used Hallertau &amp; Godiva hops. Godiva are a ‚Äúnew‚Äù hop that come from the UK. Slightly spicy with a strong gooseberry flavor/nose. 

I also added .25 oz of dried chamomile flowers. 

This may seem like a kitchen sink beer but the wort came out great and the flowers melded wonderfully. I pitched with Omega‚Äôs Jovaru at 90*f. The yeast gives off strong lemon pitch and pepper notes, ferments super dry but leaves a ton of glycerol that adds mouthfeel and body. 

My hopes is that the chamomile and gooseberry hop flavor meld well with the earthy-berry flavor from the mulberries and brett. This is my first ‚Äúmixed Ferm‚Äù beer so I really don‚Äôt know what to expect. 

If anyone has any suggestions on a particular brett strain let me know.

"7% Hazy IPA - Riwaka Hops Front and Center! Hey my dudes. I'm back with another NEIPA, similar to my last with the grain bill and brewing approach. You'll notice if you have looked at any of my stuff before I don't deviate much from my grain bill from batch to batch.

If you haven't used Riwaka in your hazy IPAs, I highly recommend giving it a try. It is so flavorful without being overwhelming. I'm super pleased with my results on this batch.

"Great guidance if you want to bottle NEIPAs For anyone who hasn't seen it, this is an excellent guide on bottling NEIPAs while minimizing oxidation:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/d0c6hn/actually_you_can_bottle_neipas_at_home_or_how_i/

I just finished the last of my NEIPAs I bottled on November 8th, and it still tastes excellent, with barely any change in color. If you're interested in brewing NEIPAs but can't/don't want to keg, I strongly recommend you take a look.

A couple notes on my tweaks to the process:

* I've got a Tilt, so I bottled when it was at 1.020 gravity. This happened 56 hours after pitching the yeast, so pretty close to the recommended 48 hour wait. Dry hops were in the fermenter a total of 5 days before bottling.

* I fill the bottles to the brim, adding a bit extra to fill up the bottle after I pull out the bottling wand. No idea how big of a difference it makes, but I like the idea of minimizing in bottle oxygen.

* I think the process works better with a higher quality bottle capper. My last NEIPA before this, I followed basically the same process, and noted that a few of the bottles were noticeably oxidized after a few weeks, but others were not. I speculated this was due to to the quality of the cap's seal. For this NEIPA I used a higher quality bench capper, and every bottle was great.

* Be careful when pouring the beer! There will be a small but significant amount of trub at the bottom of the bottle, since you're not cold crashing- make sure it doesn't end up in your glass.",Homebrewing

My question is between the aforementioned systems, is the cost for the Clawhammer over the Anvil Foundry worth it?

"Wind Malt / Mixed Fermentation On Mulberries. Brewed my first mixed fermentation beer today. I am pitching primary with Omega‚Äôs Jovaru. After primary I‚Äôm racking onto some mulberries I picked over the summer and pitching with Brett. Any suggestions on a Brett strain is welcome. This is new territory for me. 

All malt cake from Sugar Creek Malt Co. Exact recipe is in photos. I used wind malt, wheat, oats and rye. For hops I used Hellertau &amp; Godiva (gooseberry) and some dried chamomile. 

The Jovaru yeast should shine with the hops and chamomile. It gives off a strong lemon pith and pepper note, along with a lot of glycerol making it a dry beer with lots of body. I don‚Äôt know if brett eats glycerol or not, but I‚Äôll find out in about 6 months. 

I mashed at 134F for 20 min then stepped up to 158F. At the end of my mash I did a single decoction to get some color and melanoidin off the malt. Wind Malt is as pale as it gets, figured a little color would help. It went into the fermentor looking like honey. 

I‚Äôm really excited to see how this beer turns out after primary and then onto letting the brett have its way with it.

"Blending and Residual CO2 Question I'll be blending two barrel aged sours shortly, and I'm confused about some details when using the excel sheet referenced by Mike Tonsmeire here: [Priming Barrel-Aged and Blended Sour Beers | The Mad Fermentationist - Homebrewing Blog](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2014/07/priming-barrel-aged-and-blended-sour.html)  


I plan on bottling 5gal of of the base beer (a funky saison, 1.005 FG), as well as a 50/50 (2.5gal/2.5gal) blend of that and another sour (1.010 FG). The calculator states for the 5gal of the base saison alone has: 0.43 Residual CO2, and 0.43 Predict CO2 w/o Sugar -&gt; needing **7.75 oz table sugar** to hit 3.2 vols  


But when crunching the numbers for a 50/50 blend, the sheet states the combined components have 0.43 Residual CO2 and *1.71 Predict CO2 w/o Sugar* \-&gt; needing **4.18 oz table sugar** to hit 3.2 vols  


It seems from a practical aspect, blending two similar beers with the same residual CO2 should yield the same ""Predict CO2 w/o sugar"" as only one. **Why does the ""Predicted CO2 w/o sugar"" more than quadruple when blending?** I'd like to wrap my head around this and be able to trust this sheet, as it's the matter of a difference of *3.6 oz sugar* and the potential to vastly undercarbonate a great beer.

"Any insights for S23 fermentation schedule/time? I brewed a cream ale recipe last Sunday that was one of my LHBS house recipes, and the yeast they provided was S23.  i did a double take since this was an ale, but I called back to verify and they said that it was correct.  Brew day went fine, pitched the yeast at around 75F (no starter), and brought down to my fermentation fridge set to 55 on Sunday afternoon.

I saw airlock activity had stopped this morning, so I thought I'd grab a gravity sample.  I'm fermenting in an SS Brewbucket, so I have a valve to grab samples from the bottom - no biggie.  It came out looking like [this, aka superchunky from hell](https://imgur.com/eWe0MDz).  Obviously there is still a crapload of yeast in suspension, and I was wondering if anybody had any insight as to when it's likely to drop out - I thought S23 was supposed to be bottom fermenting?

Aside from it having the consistency of a milkshake, the flavor seems about right for what I was expecting.  My larger issue is when I should consider pulling it from the fermentation fridge for a diacetyl rest since I clearly am not going to get an accurate gravity reading with all that crap still in there.  Should I just wait until day 10 and try again?

- For ease, I'd like to use the unfermented sugar as opposed to adding a sugar solution.
- Previously I have just transferred to a keg with a 1-2 Plato left which carbonated fine the but left a VERY unclear beer (still murky 4 weeks in the keezer

My Plan:
- Cold crash when 2-3 Plato estimated left
- Hold for a day or two
- Pressure transfer to keg
- Attach spunding valve and let keg warm back up to fermentation temp to carbonate


Other thoughts:
- I think it should work as it's no different than cold crashing then adding a sugar solution
- I'm trying to minimize the number of transfers. I've also previously transferred to a keg to carbonate then transferred again to a serving keg but that's more cleaning and more CO2 wasted.

"A note for anyone considering a 10G Spike Solo I recently had my first brew day on my pre-sale 10G Spike Solo.  Overall the day was very smooth.  It took me barely 25 minutes to get from 60 degree groundwater up to 158, and then maybe 15 minutes post-mash to get up to boil.  Clean-up was simple.  The thing is a beast and will probably outlive me... the kettle and basket with all tri-clamps attached is almost 40 pounds.

There is one thing that caught me off guard though that isn't listed in any of the online information, so I wanted to drop a mention here.

With the 10G version, when hanging the basket from the stainless hooks, the bottom of the basket sits between the 6 and 6.5 gallon mark (it hangs at a slight angle).  My system setup is I believe fairly typical (5 gallons into keg, half a gallon loss to fermenter, half a gallon loss to kettle trub, 1 gallon/hour boil-off, so pre-boil volume is 7G cold) so the bottom couple of inches of grain was fully submerged and wasn't able to drain.  This left behind a bunch of wort in the grain when I pulled the basket, as well as making a mess.

I reached out to Spike's customer support and confirmed that this is the expected level of the basket.  Unfortunately, this means that for the basket to be able to drain while hanging, the biggest batch size is 5 gallons _only if_ you don't count any loss for trub or fermentation, and limit to a 60 minute boil... so realistically, it's more like 4 gallons into the keg.  To be able to manage a larger batch size, the choices are basically to deal with the submerged grain, add top-up water pre-boil, or use a hoist instead of the hooks.

The basket draining method one was of the features that I was looking forward to with the Solo since I didn't want a hoist, so I'm a bit disappointed that it won't work as expected.  I've suggested to their support that they include this information in their FAQs (maybe the [Basket Dimensions](https://help.spikebrewing.com/knowledge/will-the-solo-basket-fit-non-spike-kettles)).  So, I'm writing here in case this information is useful to someone (especially if you're on the fence between the 10G and the 15G).",Homebrewing

"Typical Expense I was looking through some recipes on Brewer‚Äôs Friend, and there was a very highly rated NEIPA at the top of the list. I looked through the grain bill and hop bill and decided to put all the ingredients in a cart on Northern Brewer, just to get a price reference. I put each grain in to the next pound, which is the smallest unit you can buy. I don‚Äôt have a grain mill so I chose to have them pre-milled. I chose the hops based on 8oz packs because it was cheaper than the individual 1oz packs in the quantities required. A total of almost 14 lbs of grain and 14 Oz of hops. So there would be a small amount leftover to start building an inventory, but not much.

It was $111, plus $21 for the water treatment salts they specified for the water profile (I‚Äôve never done any water treatment so that would be my initial buy-in of those packages). Of course those would get used for a long time after, but still an expense for me to do it by the recipe.

Is that a normal amount to pay for smaller packages of ingredients like that? Does one have to have the space to store large quantities of malts to be able to brew from recipes instead of recipe kits? Is NB just expensive?

"Some advice for a college student? Hey everyone, 

I've been brewing at home twice now. First time was in my previous house, which had a gas stove, which worked reasonably well. Second time was in my current house, on an electric stove. Which is really, really difficult. I simply can't keep up with the rising and falling temperatures, and as the stove only has 6 different settings (excluding 'off'), I don't have a lot of room. 

Right now, it's just a lot of effort for beer that will probably turn out to be shitty. So I've been thinking of buying a brewing kettle (or whatever that might be called in english) to at least fix the problem of the stove. I've seen several, ranging from ‚Ç¨150 to well over ‚Ç¨500. As a college student, I'm broke half of the time and want to buy a lot of other things the rest of the time, this is a decision I'd like some advice on.

"Trying my first spontaneous and mixed fermentation sour. General advice or tips? I've been venturing down the road of sour beers. I've made 5 or 6 batches of various kettle sour beers with good success. I'm looking to try some other methods of souring - primarily a mixed fermentation and a spontaneous fermentation and then aging.  I've never done either or purposely aged a beer before so I'm looking for some advice on the gran bill, methods, and any other general advice from others that have done this. 

I have a grainfather and I'm planning to make a single batch of wort and then splitting up into one mixed and one spontaneous carboy for fermenting. 

I'm not too picky about exactly how it turns out / the ingredients. More or less looking to try something new and learn along the way. 

**Base Recipe / Notes:**

* 10lb Maris Otter (\~72%)
* 2lbs Unmalted Wheat (\~15%)
* 1lb Vienna (\~8%)
* 8oz. Oats
* Mash @ 156F and boil for 1 hour
* Notes:  This is something I created looking at other lambic / golden sour ale recipes (swapping out other suggested pilsner/2-row for maris otter to add a more malty flavor. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Mixed Fermentation Batch**

* Planning to pitch a mixed culture of lacto, sacc., and brett.  Thinking WLP655. Thoughts?
* Planning to wait for fermentation to complete and add some oak chips (I would use cubes but I have chips on hand already).  Any ideas how much to use per gallon for a lightly-oaked flavor?
* Not planning to rack to secondary - will keep on the yeast cake until it is ready to bottle (12 months+)

**Spontaneous Fermentation Batch**

* Will cool the wort down to safe temps for my fermenter bucket (\~100F) or so and let it naturally cool down with a fan pointed at it in my backyard for several hours. 
* Once cool I'll close it up and put an airlock on and wait for primary to finish.  After primary is complete I'll rack to a secondary vessel and will add some oak chips (again - thoughts on how much to add for a lightly oaked batch?)

The balloon will still have some CO2 in it but not enough to displace the beer in the fermenter as it fills up the keg, so there will be some oxygen exposure.

"Why can't I put carbonation drops in the fermenter? I'm new to homebrewing and still learning the fundamentals.

"My experience with Philly Sour. Any tips for improvement?   

I want to share my experience with Philly Sour yeast so maybe I can answer some questions with my experience and get some tips on how to improve things that did not go exactly to plan. 

My 5 gallon Recipe:

9 lb Pilsner

4 lb Wheat

1 lb Dextrose (10 min)

Irish moss (10 min)

Mashed for an hour at 152F with a mashout of 10 minutes at 170F. 

60 minute boil. No Hops.

5 lb Cherry Pie filling in secondary 

I pitched 2 packets of Philly Sour into about 5.5 gallons at about 70F. I hit an OG of 1.064. Fermentation went hard for about 2 days bringing gravity to 1.048. At that point, my temperature had dropped to about 66F (recommended temps are 68-77F). I was able to get temps back up to 73-76F for the rest of the way. After the initial fermentation, it stayed at 1.048 for about 2 days. I was worried at that point that it had stalled but did some research and read about others with the same experience. At about day 5 it kicked off hard again for about 3 days to get to 1.015. I left it in for another 2 days where it stayed at 1.015. I measured PH at that point to be 3.59. Not as low as I would have liked (I like a really sour beer). I would have liked to get around 3.2-3.3. I put in secondary with 5lbs of cherry pie filling. I left it at 73F for two days until I saw that the color blended and then I put into the fridge to cold crash for 4 days (I added gelatin after day 1). Upon kegging, the cherry pie filling had caused about a gallon of loss. Once carbonated, I tasted and it was a little sour, like I said not as sour as I would like and the cherry flavor was subtle if any. 

Note: I received my water report later on and my PH is 8.1. 

Some things I would like to improve ‚Äì I would like to get my PH down to 3.2-3.3. Maybe I should try kettle souring and then pitching another yeast? I use an Anvil Foundry, is it cool to leave it in there while souring?

I've used various blends from WYeast, White Labs, and Omega, but more in the context of wild sours leaning more towards tang.

"Keezer leak Hi everyone,

I have a chest freezer that has been converted to a Keezer. My CO2 tank sits on the outside of the freezer and 5 secondary regs, which sit on the inside, are supplied from it.

I noticed that my last CO2 tank didn't last as long as normal so before I connect up the new one I wanted to check for leaks.

I've used a garden sprayer bottle to pressurise the system and true enough, after a day or so, the secondary regs are all sitting at 0 after being set to 15psi.

I've removed all the gas lines from the secondary regs to eliminate those.

I've sprayed everywhere with soapy water.

Should the system stay pressurised for that long with no additional air/CO2 being added? or should I expect it to drop to 0?

I'm looking for suggestions to build a good system.

I have some money to spend, and I want to build my own setup.

1) run a continuous recirculation with a pump, in just 1 pot
2) do not recirculate at all, but sparge with water from the second pot
3) recirculate with pump AND sparge with 2nd pot
4) drain all wort into 2nd pot, then sparge

"First brew on the Brewzilla...think this one needs to be called Murphy's Law Red TL;DR - First brew on the Brewzilla went tits-up, but stumbled into a success anyways.

I picked up a Brewzilla on Black Friday and decided to do my first brew with it today.  I'm still pretty new to brewing, I've done 4 brews up to this point but wanted to move to all-grain and due to space needs the all-in-one systems were the best option for me.  This weekend I unboxed the zilla cleaned it and got myself familiar with the control panel, program steps, and how long it took to get to temperature in preparation for brewing today.  This morning I set the timer so that it would start warming up about an hour and a half before I got home from work and hit start. My wife was working from home so made sure she knew that it would be turning on this afternoon, then out the door I went.  This became issue number one...whatever I did this morning for the timer was not what I did this weekend, as it apparently started heating up immediately. About 2 and a half hours into my work day my wife called me saying that it wouldn't stop beeping so she paused it because that was the only way she could get it to shut up.  I told her that was fine and I would call on my way home and tell her how to start it in manual mode.  This leads in to the only smooth part of the brew day, when I got home the water was 3 degrees shy if my mash in temp and I was able to get the mash started right away and that went just like every brew video I had watched for this thing.  While the mash was happening I started to prep for the boil and eventual cooling.  I don't have a hop spider so my plan was to use small muslin bags for the hop additions, but my dog ate my muslin bags.  My plan was to pump the wort through the chiller submerged in an ice bath I thought the chiller connection kit came with silicone hoses, but I was wrong and it is vinyl hose which Im not gonna pump hot liquid through. So I decided to run to the LHBS and get some silicone tubing and new muslin bags while the wort was coming up to a boil...but...I forgot the LHBS changed their hours due to Covid and they were closed when I got there.  Stopped for dinner at Whataburger for the family...not a single order was made correctly.  Now the boil is coming to an end, I decided I'll just used the chiller as an immersion chiller...and sonnofabitch...the sprayer is seized to the hose...goddamnitmitherhellbitch...the hose is seized to the hose bib.  So now I just gotta run the recirc pump and let this come down to temp the long way.  Now despite all of this, I was able to get this brew day finished and I learned a ton...and really enjoyed myself once I was able to laugh about everything seemingly going tits-up.

The recipe I brewed was [the Irish red on homebrewtalk top 100](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/raging-red-irish-red-ale.239188/) with a projected OG of 1.059...and I hit it pretty dam close to [spot on](https://i.imgur.com/hbnvmh6.jpg).

"Brewing with raw wheat update Hey folks,

Asked a few days ago about brewing with unmalted wheat (wheat berries in this case, not flaked or torrified).

Since I got so many different answers, I decided to try out a single 90min infusion instead of messing around. I was planning on reaching about 65% mash efficiency, but had to scale up my water and hops because with a 90min single infusion of 50/50 pilsner and unmalted wheat berries, I achieved a mash efficiency of 79%.

I milled my pilsner and my wheat berries in my mill at the smallest gap, ran it through a second time, and mixed in half a pound of rice hulls. Mashed @150 walked away for 90min while it recirculated, and then came back to ramp up to mash out temp @168 to make lautering a little easier and left it recirculate for another 15 mins. 

I prepared 10gallons of water total incase of increased absorption, despite requiring 8.7gallons. Planned to mash with 5ish and sparge with 4ish. Ended up using all of it in the sparge. 

I made this choice based on the gelatinization temperature of wheat being less than mash temperature. I use a single vessel, electric, brew in a basket system. If I realized how easy it would be to get decent conversion I probably would have done a full volume mash.",Homebrewing

"Canning from a Keg for maximum carbonation and shelf-stability?   

Hello everyone. I‚Äôve got the homebrew-scale version of the Oktober can seamer (SL1), and I love it. Up until now, I have been can-conditioning\* my beer. I prime just like you‚Äôd do with bottles, and fill as high as I can to minimize air/head space. With a few odd exceptions, I‚Äôve had great results!

I recently bought a keezer (during the great freezer shortage of 2020, no less!), and now I‚Äôm falling back into my lazy kegging ways. However, I‚Äôd still like to can beers from my kegs.

Most of the stuff online is for someone working at the counter of a microbrewery, and hurriedly and sloppily ‚Äúcapping on foam‚Äù and handing the crowler back to the customer, and maybe wiping the sides a few times with a bar rag. I‚Äôm looking for something much more ‚Äúshelf-stable‚Äù than that, something that can keep for months. 

I‚Äôm assuming the same rules from bottling apply:

**All methods:**

1. Make sure cans are cold, but not frozen
2. Minimize foaming any way you can (see above)
3. Sanitize the cans (I‚Äôve been using a sulfite solution instead of Star San lately with great results, I brew lots of beers with massive whirlpool and dry hop additions so I‚Äôm pretty oxyphobic!)
4. Use the lowest PSI on the regulator you can that will still push beer (and be sure to ‚Äúburp‚Äù the kegs first!)

**Lazy method:**

* Straight from a tap/picnic tap, try to minimize foam

**Intermediate lazy method:**

* Run tubing from tap/keg/etc with a traditional bottling wand jammed in it

**DIY beer gun:**

* Use a homemade contraption that‚Äôs like the Blichmann gun, but way cheaper.

**Expensive beer gun:**

* Buy the latest gear from Blichmann so you can CO2 purge

Would anything be different with cans? Maybe the CO2 purging would be less effective? Any other tips I‚Äôm missing?

"Kegging: Regulator dropped set point I'm new to kegging and have a question.

I put my Co2 cylinder and reg in the fridge which was still fairly warm and set the reg to 12 psi to carb the two kegs. after 6 hours in the fridge the temp had dropped to about 6c (42.8f) and the reg showed a new set point of 8 or 9. I thought it was odd, and set it back to 12psi. the next morning the fridge was down to about 2c (36f) and the reg was once again showing a set point of 8. I left it there over night again, I wanted to take a look on line to see if I could figure it out.

Am i right in thinking that as the temp dropped the setting on the dial would also drop? 

Am I fine to go back to the 12 psi setting as my temp in the fridge is pretty much stabilized?

I read a few posts that suggested it but I had to ask.

I'm thinking that I shouldn't have bothered to set the reg to my desired setting until the temp in the fridge hit operating temp and the beer in the kegs had been chilled to the right temp.

I'm confident that I don't have a leak, well kinda confident. I checked all the connections that were either factory or the ones that I changed out, no leaks. The kegs, while used, showed up under pressure.

Am I right in my assumptions about the reg and temp? I'd like to set the reg back to 12 again, but I was afraid that I might open the fridge tomorrow and see all of the changes come back and instead of being 12 it's 20 or higher!

I was drinking/eating my grandmother's creation since I was a wee baby before immigrating to United States in my teen years when my parents stopped supplying me rice wine because it was against the law. Since moving to the US, my mother had made many batches of rice wines and I have also made multiples in college (I do more beer brewing though). I will write out the recipe below 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Soak sticky rice for 6-10 hours, steam them through (don't cook them like regular rice)
2. After rice cools down, sprinkle crushed yeast ball into the rice and mix (get them in Chinese markets or Amazon) Each ball can do around 1 pound dry rice.
3. Pack the rice mixture into a clear container (NO ADDITIONAL WATER !) 
4. (If you are also using red yeast rice: sprinkle the grinded down red yeast rice on top) If not just ignore this step, they can also be found in Chinese markets or on Amazon
5. Use a spoon or an utensil to dig a well in the middle.
6. Cover the glass container and let it ferment (important to cover up), 
7. When there's liquid in the center well (usually 3-5 days if it's warm or up to a week in winter) you've got yourself a delish low abv rice wine, put it in the fridge to stop it from fermenting or leave it out a couple more days to get a stronger one. It can be stored in fridge for a couple weeks. 
8. If you let it sit more outside, rice would float to the top 

These following points need to be followed for an authentic Chinese rice wine experience

1. You need to use Sticky Rice (find them at any Asian supermarkets)
2. The rice need to be soaked then steamed, not cooked in water
3. You should not add any water to the rice after soaking initially, the alcohol will come out of the rice 
4. Don't stir, let it sit 
5. It should be a low abv sweet wine generally under 5% abv
6. Don't discard the rice, eat them, they taste sweet and boozy 
7. Try cooking with the fermented rice [https://thewoksoflife.com/sweet-fermented-rice-jiu-niang/](https://thewoksoflife.com/sweet-fermented-rice-jiu-niang/) that seems to be a good recipe",Homebrewing
"HELP! Disaster aversions advice required. Hi homebrew crew.

I am trying to avert a minor disaster. I have had my Christmas booze brewing for a while now and most of it is happily clearing. I have some strong Yorkshire ale, some Russian stout, some red fruit cider and some desperados style larger.

All are form kits.

The Desperados is actually the Mexican beer from bulldog with some tequila mix added for the 2nd fermentation along with some lime cordial. This is my problem beer. It has another week or two to clear and to be ready to be drunk. However today in testing I discovered there is a crack in the barrel. The result of which is that the beer is not fizzy. This, in and of itself, isn't a huge issue as it tastes great. (I will share the process for making desperados style beer from a kit if anyone is interested in the future)

As I see things I have 3 options to save this beer.

1. do nothing, drink it quickly (23 litres) adding propellant gas to the keg as we go and hope not too much O2 gets in to spoil it
2. rack it into another keg re-gas and drink from there, will still be pretty flat but tastes good so what the hey
3. rack it into another keg with brewing sugar, have another fermentation and drink it in February
4. bin it... not going to happen

"Brewfather Water question I'm a looooong time homebrewer, but this is my first BIAB batch.  I'm also using Brewfather for the first time. So, I'm trying to understand everything before I start (planning to brew this weekend).

At the very top of my recipe, there's a pre-boil volume of 6.4 gallons.  At the bottom of the recipe, it shows 

**7.43 gal mash water**

**7.43 gal total water**

**8.35 gal mash volume**

Am I understanding this correctly that, in my mash tun, I will put 7.43 gallons of water.  Once I add the grains, it will come up to 8.35 gallons.  When I lift the bag, it should come to 6.4 gallons, which I boil down to 5.5 gallons. 

Is this correct?",Homebrewing
"Advice on this IPA clone recipe? Hi!

I'm new to homebrewing (I've just completed my first batch, a chocolate milk stout) and I want to try my hand at a clone recipe for one of my favorite IPAs, the Mad Tom IPA. I've looked it up online and found [this recipe](https://brewgr.com/recipe/35886/clone-of-muskoka-mad-tom-clone-american-ipa-recipe) which seems right on the money considering the information given on the official [brewery's page](https://muskokabrewery.com/beer/mad-tom-ipa/).

My problem is the following; I don't have the space or equipment do to all-grain brewing. So I'm working with extracts. It worked quite well for my first homebrew; I replaced the base malt with a similar extract and the specialty grains were clearly pointed out in the recipe. It seems a bit more complicated with this one. Right off the bat, I'm thinking my specialty grains would be the Crystal grains...? And I'm wondering what kind of extract I should go with. I was thinking pale extract? But the ESB Malt takes up a considerable portion of the total grain bill. So I wasn't sure.

I'm also wondering if a boozy recipe such as this one would call for two packets of (rehydrated) SafAle US-05?

And finally, I've seen so many people online dismiss secondary fermentation as unnecessary but the book I've read on homebrewing swears by it. This recipe calls for dry-hopping, should I dry hop in a secondary vessel or can I just do it in my primary fermentor?

Thanks in advance! :)",Homebrewing
"1664 Blanc clone with Mangrove Jack M21 yeast? Hi! 

So, I'm brewing my first-ever witbier, and I'm thinking of making some sort of a 1664 Blanc clone with orange peels, coriander, and a pinch of ginger. 

All the recipes I found on the internet used WLP400 / WLP410. 

But the things is, I rather not suffer with the liquid yeast. I don't  have a stirplate nor a flask, I wouldn't like to spend extra on DME and nutrients, and certainly would not want to wait days.

Plus, even if I buy 2 packs of dried M21, it's still almost half as cheap as 1 packet of WLP410. And the M21, I can just sprinkle on top, no hassle.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is, how different (and I mean ""worse"") would the M21 be compared to WLP410 when making a 1664 Blanc clone?

"2nd Gen Yeast Tolerance I'm fairly new to brewing so apologies if I'm overlooking something basic, but I've tried to do some research and haven't found much.

I'm currently fermenting a dubbel (OG 1.060) with Mangrove m47 yeast. The yeast package mentions an alcohol tolerance of 8%. 

After the dubbel finishes fermenting, if I were to pitch a heavy dark/quad onto this yeast cake will I be able to get much above the 8% tolerance?

"Help! Will i get heavy metal poisoning if I drink this? Bit of a long explanation but bare with me, I was making a mango and peach cider and when I checked about 2 weeks in it stinked of sulphur, I had forgotten to put yeast nutrient in. After a quick Google I saw that you could splash rack it at the risk of oxidation. A beer hack I like to do with my IPAs to prevent oxidation is to add vitamin C so I thought it would be a good idea to add it to the cider so I did before splash racking it. But still no dice it stunk of sulphur something terrible. After some more googling I put three copper coins and a tiny coil of copper wire in a hop bag and put them in the fermentor for three hours. The idea here being that the copper reacts with the sulphur and then drops out of solution and any leftover can be cleared with bentonite which is what I was planning on doing. However I know the vitamin C can react with metal particles to form superoxidisers and oxidise the cider heavily which I'm honesty not too worried about. What I am worried about is that if it is possible that the copper could be brought back into the solution because of this reaction and possibly lead to heavy metal poisoning?

Plan 2. Post fermentation. I don't do secondary. Think adding fruit after fermentation without racking off yeast is a problem? (Can't dump yeast with the Flex)

Plan 3. I don't have another fermenter other than a bucket. I could rack into a bucket with the fruit. I am a bit obsessed about oxygen ingress so I'm not a fan of this...however willing to do whatever is best.

"Are Partial Mashes Really This Good? Hey everyone! 6-7 years ago I started brewing. First I began with basic kits that didn't make great beers, but as time went on I learned more and more and started all grain BIAB and non-BIAB brews. I did this for about 6+ of those years. Recently, while making a few batches for Christmas season when friends come over, I decided I was pressed for time (I aimed for 5 separate beers - all bottled conditioned), so without much time, I said ""shag it"" and went with a partial mash recipe I came up with on the fly for 2 beers. Essentially, I made a split batch with the same beer, except that one I added some post-mash oats for additional body. I did one with just EKG and the other as a sort of red IPA. Both hit 5.5% ABV.

I had a few ideas for what to do to make sure the beer was going to be decent. I added yeast nutrient, which I never do, and I made sure to do a good step mash on the few grains I did mash. I also made sure to have great yeast starters for both. The result? Two blow offs (one of which actually knocked off the airlock)! What an active ferment.

Anyhow, I tried both today while bottling and I can already tell that these two beers are by far the two best beers I've ever made. I'm blown away. I felt like I was somewhat cheating the process, but man oh man if this is the result.....I don't know if I can go back to full all grain.

I had a few goals with this brew:
- A balanced, but crushable beer with a noticable hop presence
- The final product still reads like a lager
- Test out the effectiveness of a hot (185F) whirlpool for bitterness and aroma
- See if Idaho-7 is the miracle hop people say it is

Here's the recipe:

OG - 1.050
FG - 1.009
IBU - 45
ABV - 5.2%

7# Rahr Domestic Pilsner
2# Weyermann Vienna
0.5# Crystal-20
0.5# Belgian Biscuit

0.5 oz Cascade @60
0.5 oz Cascade @10
1 oz Idaho-7 @10

1 oz each Idaho-7 and Mosaic 185F Whirlpool for 15 min

1 oz each Idaho-7 and Mosaic dry hop

Fermented with S-33 @55F, raised to 60F after seven days. Cold crashed at terminal, kegged, then cold conditioned 3 weeks.

http://imgur.com/gallery/PxR1S4O

The final product is, in a word, fantastic. It is crisp and light like a lager, with a wonderful aroma and smooth bitterness that follows through to the finish. The aroma isn't overwhelming but has sweet berry and cherry notes. The taste is a touch sweet with biscuity malt notes, and a brightness from the Cascade that I think pairs really well with a lager body.

I'd love to see more brewers take a crack at the style. Subtlety and balance can be difficult but very rewarding.

"Carbonation loss halfway through keg. What‚Äôs happening? This is my second batch kegging.  When the keg gets about half empty the carbonation is nearly absent in my pours.  The foam head is barely there and there are no bubbles rising in the glass.

"Collected 20+ mixed ferm samples and 2 Bootleg Biology solera packs for solera barrel project. Just got an itch to do a spon instead, and now I'm not sure what to do with it all. Help me decide? I have a 15 gallon barrel which will be free in 2-3 months. I have a ton of collected mixed fermentation samples. I have 7 gallons of lambic style wort cooling overnight outside. The spon will go in glass so I can check for mold before it goes into the barrel.

But the question is... What to do with all the awesome samples and bootleg biology packs I have saved up?

I don't have a ton of space... So I'm torn. I could just throw it all in the spon once it shows no mold, but then I don't get to blend.

I could also do another 7 gallons of lambic style wort soon, get another carboy (or sacrifice a bucket) and put the BB packs into it, and the samples into a couple 1 gal jugs, split by lambic / gueuze or various mixed cultures. Then I'd be able to blend in a year... But I'm running low on storage space and that seems like quite a bit of extra effort.

"What did I make and how did it happen? So a long time ago I had a job at edible arrangements and noticed that after they cut the heart out of the pineapple core they just throw away the rest of the pineapple.. the most edible and most delicious part of the pineapple.... Sooo I took it home. I ended up with like 50lbs of pineapple so i gave a ton of it away.

Anyways I ended up with a ridiculous amount of pineapple juice enough to fill bottles up with. one bottle was a pop cap bottle and this bottle got forgotten in the fridge for awhile. about a couple weeks in we cracked it craving pineapple juice and discovered it fermented a little bit kuz it was a little bit fizzy but tasted wonderful!

I threw in a cinnamon stick and a couple cloves and let it sit for like another month or so... (we just forgot about it for awhile)

The time comes where we remember about our little bb in the fridge and we pop that bad boy open. the cap pops with the pressure of a shaken champagne bottle and lets out a 1/6 of the bottle in foam or whatever but the way those flavors developed in that bottle was AMAZING!! The pineapple cinnamon clove combo and the way the pineapple flavor had developed. It had a nice crisp fizz to it too that was just Soooo Right!

My thoughts are that it could be 1 of 3 things. Too higher alcohol killed the yeast, it's a darker beer so taking longer to carbonate, the yeast settled more than normal so it's taking longer to carbonate as less yeast is suspended.

I don't have a great palate, but I'd say where it's lacking is in needing a stronger malt character to back up the spices.

The noble hop character plays so well with the water profile and the slight malty back bone compliments the smokiness, ending very crisp.

Anywho, I keep having  issues with my numbers.¬† Like, they're not consistent.¬† I religiously  have pre-boil readings that are higher than post-boil.¬† I'll have  pre-boil gravities lower than after boiling and adding 2 pounds of  sugar.¬† Usually I Papazian it and move on, thinking it would be stratification of the wort or something.

While  brewing today I was getting measurements pre-boil and figured I'd do a little experiment.  If I stired the boil and put drops from the spoon on the refractometer and got 15.25 brix.  If I stir the boil and put drops from a pipette on the refractometer, I  get 12 brix. I repeated this like 5 times with the same results.¬† The pipette didn't have any water on/in it (might have had residue from the previous sample) and these measurements were taken within seconds of each-other with a rinsed off and towel dried refractometer plate.

After chilling today's wort, the refractometer read 13 brix.

The only think I can think of is the metal spoon evaporating wort in the second it's between wort and refractometer, but that seems bonkers, or keeping the sample exceptionally hot... although, waiting around for a minute didn't change any of the readings.

Beersmith states that this yeast should ferment between 59-75 F, but on Fermentis site, it says that, ideally, it should sit between 64-75F (I just notice this).

"First world beer problems - It doesn't get cold enough to make an ice beer I brewed up a 7% ABV brown ale a couple months ago and was planning on making an 'eis-brown'.  The plan was simple:

1. brew a higher abv beer
2. let it ferment to completion
3. rack to a clean keg
4. put the keg outside when it got cold enough to freeze some of the water in the beer
5. rack the unfrozen beer to a serving keg
6. carbonate and enjoy

I got to step 3 just fine and had been watching the weather for the last month, waiting for it to get cold enough at night where i thought it would adequately freeze the beer.

Well, last night the forecasted low was 9'F so I put the keg outside around 2 in the afternoon when it was 34'F.  I let it sit outside from 2pm -&gt; 6am.  It was 10'F when I woke up and thought things went well.  

I shook the keg a little bit and heard icy slush in there.  I proceeded with step 5 from above, hoping it froze enough.  When the transfer was complete, I opened the original keg and saw there was maybe an inch of slush at the bottom.  Definitely not enough to really see any kind of significant abv boost.

The forecast for the foreseeable future has lows only around 30, so I guess I'm going to have to be happy with what I got.

Finally got it, changed battery, replaced lid and dropped it in a batch.  Seemed to work fine, but on keg transfer noted that there were little droplets of moisture in the tube and the weights on the end of the battery looked corroded.  I took photos and sent them to tilt guys asked only for ideas to keep moisture out or if I was doing something wrong.  They are sending me a brand new tilt.  Marcus emailed me confirmed my address and it‚Äôs in the mail.  Cant thank them enough.  Will be sending them the old one, still not sure what happened exactly but would guess a bad o-ring or something.  I think I‚Äôll use keg lube on it this time and maybe I the threads too...dunno.

"Pump flow varies? A question for all you plumbers or fluid engineers out there.

I have an overly-complicated E-HERMS 3 vessel system, mostly hard piped with silicone hose from kettle to pump, hose from mash tun to pump and hose from HERMS exit to mash return. The wort is moved by a Riptide pump. 

Often during my mash recirc the flow will vary wildly, sometimes even stop, requiring me to open up the riptide valve and get it really moving and then try to dial it back to an easy flow. If I crank it all the way open it doesn't vary. The are no husks/debris in the recirc and the pump never sounds like it's cavitating.

Any ideas what causes this? Wrong sized pipe or tubing? turbulence? Too much plumbing? Air pockets? Too much head? Too little?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",Homebrewing
"My Beer Spreadsheet (The last time) [My last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/dtwm18/beer_spreadsheet_version_54/)

I think my beer spreadsheet is in a place where I'm happy with it. It's not perfect, but it does everything I need and I'm not going to chase perfection. I'm keeping this free to edit as you please, so you can feel free to take it farther if you'd like. I mean hey, it's free!

[Here's the latest desktop version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e34a5JHEoH-6IEPhhK5e0uwKVXyZRqOq/view?usp=sharing). Make sure Macros are enabled if you're going to use them.

Here's why you might be interested in the newest version of the desktop file:

* It computes everything you need for making beer recipes. Also these updates:
* Figured out how to add DME, juice, and sugars correctly.
* Made the style, hop, and fermentable tables editable without crashing everything (including clearing). So now you can change what's there or add your own stuff. Adding hops works but you might want to go into the macro if you want to add a hop *and* have the macro reset it.
* Added AHA styles
* Added every hop BSG sells as of 1-1-19. 
* split decoction into adding back in vs separate boils.
* Fixed so many bugs, and more

[And here's the google sheets version!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1acAVLadS33pLeHeZzQtfmJ5lnQ30tVWNcWtaGlYzF5Y/edit?usp=sharing)

To use the sheets version, go to File-&gt;Make a Copy. 

Now there's a downside of the Google Sheets version, I could never get the beerxml compatibility to work. However:

* You now no longer need excel! Any web browser with HTML5 that can run Google Sheets should be able to run this.
* All the macros are in Tools-&gt;Macros. Skipping between English and Metric? You got it. Clearing and resetting? Sure. They do take longer due to being on the cloud, but it means I can type up a recipe at work and pull it up on my phone later.
* The inputs autofill! No more scrolling on those tiny dropdowns.
* There are the macros GUI\_print and Metric\_GUI\_print. Pressing those will (hopefully) create a pdf of your recipe and it will add it as a new document in your drive. There might be some issues about hidden sheets but idk I just going back to the associated GUI page and trying again and it works.

"White spots growing on top of cider in secondary This cider is made with raw juice from a local orchard, I basically just poured the juice into a sanitized carboy, pitched some Red Star Premier Blanc yeast into it, and put an airlock on it. No added sugar or anything.

I let it go about two weeks until it stopped bubbling, then I used an autosiphon to rack into a new sanitized carboy. I took some spices (clove, cinnamon, allspice, maybe some nutmeg and star anise, I can't remember) and boiled them for a few minutes in some filtered water. Then I poured the water with the spices still in it into the jug and sealed with an airlock.

It's been in secondary with the spices for 4 weeks now. I meant to bottle after two weeks but haven't found the time. I was getting ready to bottle last night and noticed this white (fungal?) growth on the top. 

My plan is to proceed with bottling as normal, using the autosiphon to make sure none of the growth makes it into the bottles. Then I intend to pasteurize the filled bottles.

"The downside of cheapening out A couple of years ago, I purchased a used 14 gallon Bachmann fermentor with the leg extensions.  My environmental chamber is in a different room than my brewlab which means I have to fill it in one room, then get it into my environmental chamber in another.

Looked at the cost of Blichmann casters and there was no way I was going to pay 100 bucks for some steel and casters.  So I went to harbor freight, bought a cheap flat dolly, disassembled it and cut it up then secured the fermentor ( sans extensions) to the dolly.  It worked enough to work but it was pretty much amateur hour ( the dump valve was immediately above the top of the dolly, getting tubing onto the barb was a pain)

For black Friday Blichmann had a 50  percent off accessories sale and I jumped.  Putting on the casters took me 40 min ( 10 min looking for a screw I dropped) and man oh man is this better.
 
I should have done this from the start, but I wanted to cheap it out with ""good enough""
I am sure lots of people have far nicer rigs than mine and there are times when being cheap is warranted.  Seeing as I got a really good deal on it used I should have splurged for the wheels and now I am glad that I did",Homebrewing

"Best software for tracking several iSpindels? I've had my Tilt for a couple years and have loved it. But I brew for a house of 6 beer drinkers now, so the one just isn't cutting it anymore. I've decided it's more cost effective to build a few iSpindels to start tracking batches. And the rechargability/18650 battery feature really sold me. I'll think I'll just be switching to using the Tilt on brew day to replace my refractometer/hydrometer readings, I'm not sure I trust the PET plastic in the iSpindels to take readings from hot wort.

Anyway, I still haven't settled on what I'm going to use to track them. My current setup for my Tilt is an old phone constantly logging to a Google Sheet via the Tilt app. This is what I would most like to replicate, although using an old laptop/raspberry pi isn't out of the question.

My goals are:

1. Ideally log to the cloud/Google Sheet. I know how to set up a service accessible outside my home network, but that's less than ideal.

2. Have the data easily accessible/readable later. I keep pretty detailed logs, every brew has a log folder in my Google Drive with the Br'un Water profile, Tilt spreadsheet, and detailed notes I keep via a printed and then scanned checklist. So if something goes wrong I can look back and see what changed.

"Issues with WLP-002 For years, I used 1968 for all of my stouts. Loved how it made for malty beer while floccing out like a champ, as I had no cold crash capabilities. Had read about folks who had issues with this strain floccing so well, that it‚Äôd drop out prematurely and leave under-attenuated beers, but I never had that issue. I‚Äôd rouse the yeast after 48 hours and all was good. 

Wasn‚Äôt able to get 1968 from my LHBS, so I used WLP-002 instead, as I was to understand they are fairly interchangeable. Made a brown ale about 8 weeks back, which started at about 1.050 and stalled out around 1.020. Realized it at packaging, so I just legged and drank shite Newcastle‚Äôish for a few weeks. 

I brewed a stout and just dumped it right onto the yeast cake leftover from the brown ale, and everything fermented out perfectly. Hit all my numbers. Packaged that stout and put another right on top of that yeast cake, and again, everything went perfectly. 

Brewed another brown ale last week, and used a new pack of WLP-002 with a starter. OG at 1.055 and stalled at 1.023. Dumped a dry pack of US-05 in there to see if it‚Äôd chew down the rest of those sugars, so fingers crossed.

What are the best alternatives to 1968 / WLP-002? I want something that accentuates the maltiness of my dark beers, but won‚Äôt stall out. Also, floculation isn‚Äôt nearly as big of a deal, as I have cold crash capabilities now.",Homebrewing

I just bought a  Brew-Share-Enjoy kit  from NB/Midwest.

I understand the kits don't come with bottles anymore.

Any recommendations on bottles?  12oz?  16oz?  Does a 5 gallon kit require 2 boxes of 24 bottles?

Is it easier to bottle with 16 as it requires fewer bottles?  Does the basic kit bottling equipment work with either size?

Is any additional equipment needed for sanitizing and cleaning bottles before filling?

"Assassins Creed Brew day Assistance. Hi all,  
   
I am going to do an Assassins Creed brew day this Saturday, and i got a recipe out of the game. There are some things i am going to preface this with.  
   
1. I am not using old Barley, I am going to get it milled from my local store and not colourful.

   
2. It does not put a yeast in the recipe, and i assume it's a wild yeast. I am not quite comfortable using a wild quite yet, so i would really appreciate a suggestion on what yeast to use. \*\*This is my biggest hangup\*\*

 Recipe:

 In a cauldron, take last year's barley that's grown some colourful friends, roast it over a low fire until the stink is replaced with the smell of burned syrup.

 Take equal parts new Wheat, soak it in clear ice water for two days, and add to the cauldron with enough water to fill to the top.

 Boil over a hot fire for a morning, strain into a tub and re-boil the grains one more time. 

Add to a cooled broth five apples, a bush of lavender, one medium plant of sage, and a fist sized ball of pine tar.

Cover your tub and forget about your brew for twenty nights. Store in a barrel and keep for cold eves that need a bit of warming.",Homebrewing
"Harvested yeast not separating - should I just use it all? This is my first time reusing a lager yeast (WY 2308), or any harvested yeast for that matter, and I'm a little unsure how much/how to pitch. I left a bit of beer in my fermenter, shook it up vigorously, and collected about a quart (32 oz). I placed it in the fridge for a couple hours, but it hasn't really separated like I thought it would. I planned to have trub on the bottom and liquid on top, but it's really just a bunch of trub with a tiny amount of liquid on top. What I collected was about half the total in the fermenter, but it was mixed super well and I just poured the rest out as I figured a quart would be plenty.

I plan on brewing 4 gals of 1.050 Vienna lager tomorrow, but I'm unsure how to proceed. Should I try to separate it more? Should I just pitch all of it? Part of it?

"Brewsie ""dual purpose"" kettle - confused Hi everyone, 

I'm getting a 10 Gal Brewsie kettle for Xmas; it comes with a false bottom and a bazooka screen. I'm trying to understand the logic behind the two last items. 

If I use the kettle as a mash tun, I'll still have to drain the wort into another kettle, correct? (I don't have another 10Gal kettle, so the wort would go into two or three containers. I would then need to dump out the spent grain, rinse it, and return the wort into the kettle for the boil.

"Help me improve a dark mild Hi,

I recently made 6 liters of this dark mild beer. The goal is a beer to have on weeknights so a low abv beer wirh malty flavour is desired. Here is the recipe recalculated to 19l/5 gallons

Method: Biab
Srm: 16.4
Ibu: 20
Abv: 3,3%
Og: 1.033
Fg: 1.009
Yeast: S-04 and bottle carbed to 2vol CO2

317g caramunich 2
221g flaked oats
126g chocolate malt
31g black patent
Mashed at 64C for 60 min, brewers friend predicts 5,14 mash ph. 
""batch sparged"" twice by dunking the grainbag in 3 liter of 76C water. 

Boiled for 60 min

Water chemistry (ppm) 
57 Ca
69 Cl
67 so4
88 hco3

I percieved this beer as watery, thin and flavourless and i want to improve it. Primarily wanting to increase maltyness and mouthfeel. I am thinking of upping the mash temp to 68C and the mash ph to 5,4 with calcium carbonate. In addition to this i think i will sligthly increase the grainbill to account for the higher fg and increase abv to 3,5%. What do yall think of that? 

In addition to that i have heard that toasted oats are good for increasing malty biscuity flavours, do you have any experience with this and what % of grainbill would you use? I might also increase the black patent for more roasty flavours but i am afraid of acrid contributions. 

Is caramunich ok for this style or should i get some crystal 120? What in the flavour would this change? 

For yeast i have S-04 and notty. Do you have any opinions on what is best for this beer?",Homebrewing

"Keg line balancing Hi!

I am having trouble balancing my kegline and am quite confused. Please redirect me if there is a better sub.

Anyway, I have pretty standard IPA that I want to serve with decent carbonation, but nothing crazy. I'm aiming for roughly 14 psi, which, ok, is on the high side.

I'm serving with a picnic tap, so about a foot above the keg.

I had been using a 10 foot line of 3/16"" line, nothing fancy (though I bought it a long time ago). I find the beer very foamy in the glass. I can get it to a decent place if I raise my hands up over my head, absorbing some of the pressure.

When I do the calculations, they say I should be using 4.16 feet of tubing. That seems like it will have way too little resistance and cause even more foam.

I get
LENGTH = (KEG PRESSURE -1 -(HEIGHT/2))/RESISTANCE
L= (14 - 1 -.5)/3
L= 12.5/3
LENGTH = 4.1666

Is my resistance off? I'm so confused. I thought with my experience, I'd be better off with a longer tube, but calculating much shorter!

**First Cut Attempt #1**

My take on Troeg‚Äôs First Cut. Doing two, one-hour BRIAB sessions for better attenuation. Aiming for at least 6.2% ABV and 45 IBU, but not opposed to a higher abv percent. 

**WHAT I KNOW ABOUT FIRST CUT:**

\- Uses Crystal, Pilsner and Munich malts

\- Official site claims that it uses just comet and simcoe hops, but past promotional material mentions mosaic as well. 

\- Some Untappd entries for the scratch version of it mention only simcoe in secondary. Would I only use simcoe in secondary and just comet for boil and whirlpool? Maybe.

\- Mangoes used at some point. Probably a secondary edition (5 pounds a good starting point with dryhops?)

Target OG: 1.06-1.08 range, but not too picky if it tastes good.

Target FG: 1.01

Briess - Caracrystal Wheat Malt 2 lb

Avangard Malz - Premium Munich Malt Light 8L 2 lb

**ROUGHLY 24-25 LBS OF GRAIN ALTOGETHER.**

1 Oz Simcoe 5 Minute Boil (8-9.5 IBU)

2 Oz Simcoe Whirlpool 10-15 mins (3-4 IBU)

1 Oz Comet Whirlpool 10-15 mins (1-2 IBU)

4 Oz Simcoe Dryhop 7-14 Days

5 lb Sanitized/pureed mangoes. Secondary 7-14 Days with dryhops until stable gravity.

"Belgian dubbel has hit FG.. When to bottle &amp; ABV questions Okay, I know the obvious answer is ""if it's finished, it's good to go""..... but is it?

Firstly, the yeast attenuated more than I had expected, giving me a 9% ABV beer rather than 8% (which is already quite high for a dubbel). In taking various measurements through hydrometers and refractometers and plugging them into the Northern Brewer website, I get [three different answers](https://imgur.com/a/fCMsvIq) for possible ABV. Interestingly, 1.016 was my target FG, but I trust the hydrometer more (yes, they're all calibrated correctly). But should I be paying attention to any of the other outputs?

The beer smells gorgeous. I've just finished a dry week, so I'm sipping the sample I took for the hydrometer very slowly. I get some nice flavours from it (peppery/spicy, slight floral, some dark fruit &amp; bready), but I do wonder if it could be rounded out more and if a dubbel would benefit from longer in the fermenter? It's only been 10 days so far. Or do I want to bottle it ASAP to keep most of the yeast, as the yeast form an important part of such a style, rather than letting them settle at the bottom. The alcohol burn is also real on this beer, I've never understood it when people mentioned it before, but this is.. Wow. It isn't hidden. So, again, would letting it sit for a little bit longer (I won't bottle until Sat/Sun earliest anyway, taking me to the 2 week mark). 

Due to the cold temperatures here in the UK, I now have the capability to cold crash in our conservatory. Is this something that would be recommended, or should I skip this because I want the yeast in the beer (though I appreciate cold crashing doesn't get rid of all the yeast).

Cutting corners recently I stopped the chilling at 120-130f and transfer to the fermenter since it was metal. I would splash it as.much as possible to oxygenate it for fermentation. let it cool over night and add the yeast in the morning.

Well I would ferment as usual. Dry hop. And then keg hop. Time and time again I would get an oxidized piece of garbage. Wet cardboard. Harsh sherry. Cloudy beer. 

I could figure it out. I thought it was an infection. I kept doing this short cut. I never figured the transfer was an issue. 

I boiled every tube. I super scrubbed everything. It was a nightmare.
 
Then I dawned on me. The process I changed since I got the stainless steel fermenter from the plastic bucket unused to use for years without issues... Was transferring hot wort post boil into my fermenter.",Homebrewing

"Help name my (probably unsuccessful) first ever homebrew, an introduction So, ever since craft beer started to blow up here in Alberta and my latent alcoholism could be easily spun as a cool new hobby, I‚Äôve had making my own rattling around the back of my head. Well, on Friday I finally pulled the trigger and made a pit stop after my weekly grocery trip to pick up some gear for brewing. 


Turns out the only shop within 150km in any direction of me is more interested in selling extract kits than they are in helping a complete newbie build even the most basic of brew-in-a-bag setups for all-grain brewing. So I bought the things I thought I needed, including unmilled grains, hops, and yeast. 


And because I didn‚Äôt research any recipes before I bought grains, it turns out I had about half the base malt I needed and a whole bunch of other malts that I need in much smaller quantities than the 1kg bags they came in. Undeterred I decided to roll with it and see what comes out. And considering I‚Äôve never done anything like this before in my life (aside from some lactofermented hot sauces, and one try at a sourdough starter a few years ago that I binned when it started to smell like blue cheese) I‚Äôm not expecting anything out of my first round aside from learning the process. 


And here‚Äôs where I need help. My beer needs a name. For good luck. Because if it has a name, it‚Äôll be more likely to succeed. Or I‚Äôll be more likely to drink it. One or the other. 


This was my process and ingredients for an 11L batch:

Grains: 

- Munich: 1kg
- Crystal 40: 500g
- Briess Carapils: 500g
^(all of the above was ‚Äúmilled‚Äù with a food processor because the brewing store doesn‚Äôt stock grain mills nor do they do any milling on site. 10/10 would not recommend. also, I saved my 2-row for the next brew, which was apparently the only proper base malt I bought. if this one‚Äôs gonna be a fuckup, at least round 2 will have *some* sort of proper ingredients.)


Hops:

- Centennial: 15g for 90min
- Fuggle: 15g for 30min
- Saaz/Fuggle 15g each for 5min post-boil


Strike water was 10L at 72C, for a mash temp of 67C for an hour. I sparged with 4L at 76C, then boiled for 90min, at 97C (boiling temp at my elevation). 


Specific gravity was 1.033, original gravity was 1.041 (I took gravity readings for the wort pre-and-post boil, am I doing that right?). I cooled my wort outside in a snow bank because the brewing store didn‚Äôt have a wort chiller and they didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about when I described it to them. I have one being shipped right now. It took 70 minutes to get from 90C to 22C. Does this matter? I don‚Äôt know. 


I pitched the yeast 26 hours ago, Saflager S-23, and it‚Äôs sitting in the primary fermenter right now at a steady 18C. Secondary fermentation will happen in my cold room that keeps a steady 11C. 


So, here we are, 26 hours in, and my beer is bubbling away. Now that I know I didn‚Äôt kill the yeast and that my half-baked attempt at brewing is going to produce *something*, I‚Äôm curious about three things:


1. What do I call it?
2. Guesses on flavour profile for my abomination?
3. How soon is too soon to start another?


Anyway, really excited to get this journey going and really glad that there‚Äôs a handful of breweries nearby so when this inevitably turns out to be nigh-on undrinkable I can just go fill up a few growlers and have something that I don‚Äôt need to just choke down.",Homebrewing
"First time BIAB All grain with some good fortune I went for it today and tried my hand at all grain brewing after failing with some extract brewing.

Just super pumped to not use extracts at all and nearly hit my goal after lots of research. On top of that I used some of the spent grains to try my hand at dog treats. We shall see in the coming month if everything comes out right and I end up with a good beer.

"Brett primary spoilage (Perry) I had about 10kg of pears and some White labs Brett that needed to be used, so I blended up the pears in a sanitized food processor dumped them into a sanitized 30l bucket, popped the top and airlock on and let it bubble for about a week. 

This was a very young Perry (probably should have gone three weeks) but I wanted to follow the progress, so decided to put it through the cider press after about a week or so. 

When I opened the top there were three tiny spots of white (mold?) on the floating pomme mash. I skimmed    5mm of the mash off the top with a clean spoon and discarded it. I saw no other growth so I assumed that whatever it was hadn‚Äôt penetrated the surface. 

I pressed the whole thing through a cheese cloth and into capped bottles. 


It was much closer to juice than Perry, barely alcoholic and very sweet, but the flavor was phenomenal: like racehorse sweat if racehorses sweat emoticons and jolly ranchers. 

Had half the batch over the next week. 

Now it looks like there may be some little white flecks growing on the surface of the remaining bottles. It‚Äôs too soon to know if it‚Äôs Kham‚Äôs yeast or mold, but, nonetheless, somethings there that shouldn‚Äôt be, which leads me to my question:

When using brettanomyces as the primary yeast, how do you minimize spoilage microbes? I assume in my case that the yeast didn‚Äôt raise CO2 or ethanol content fast enough (or that it didn‚Äôt drop the ph in the pomme mash; guess I should have stirred?).

Not having that annual tradition for our hundreds of dedicated judges and volunteers and our thousands of entrants left a hole in the spring and summer.But you know that saying about lemons and lemonade? Well, we took homebrew competition entries for a canceled competition and made hand sanitizer for essential workers. Since then, we‚Äôve learned a few things. First, hand sanitizer is great, but nothing beats a homebrew. Second, we never want to cancel NHC again.With uncertainty forecasted for 2021, we are doing everything we can to ensure NHC happens. After all, if you‚Äôre like us, you‚Äôve probably been brewing more than ever. And the judges in your quarantine bubble might be suffering from palate fatigue.We will bring you the best NHC ever. Here‚Äôs how we plan to do that.

In 2021, all NHC entries will be judged from our refrigerated warehouse in Colorado.

This September, many of us at the AHA helped execute the safe judging of more than 9,000 entries at the Great American Beer Festival¬Æ¬†with no COVID transmission. We will be applying what we learned to run the NHC using the Great American Beer Festival competition model.

We want to get you the best experience ever, so we‚Äôll be partnering with Great American Beer Festival judges and BJCP certified judges to execute the competition.

We typically judge about 1,300 entries for the NHC final round. This year, we‚Äôll be ready to evaluate upwards of 5,000 entries.

In order to make this event possible, we will be increasing the entry fee to $29 per entry. The increase will allow us to conduct all of the judging in one place and to take necessary health and safety precautions.We understand that 2020 has been a challenging year for many. One silver lining is that many of us have had the chance brew a few more batches, and maybe even share a few beers with friends. Our community is important to us, and ensuring the competition happens in 2021 is an important part of building that community. We invite you to hone your favorite recipe and share it with us next year. 

Cheers,John Moorhead
Competition ManagerP.S. The changes made to the competition are independent of Homebrew Con 2021. More information on Homebrew Con will be announced in January.

"Hey, water chemistry matters Just sharing a story about my experience with water chemistry. Maybe some people will have a better day knowing that all of us can struggle from time to time, others might be able to benefit from my learning experience. 

So, I've been brewing for a while. Probably about a decade at this point. I'd gone through all the phases, and my most recent one was doing BIAB, fermenting in 5 gallon corny kegs, and serving in 3 gallons. It was a sweet time. I was travelling a lot, and this setup was able to go anywhere I did. Quite literally, I brought it on a plane to Italy when I was living there. At any rate, I settled down, bought a house, and somehow ended up with a local brewery's pilot system. I had been using RO water and chemistry adjustments for a while. But with this new system, I was making more beer, and my two 5 gallon water jugs didn't quite get me all the water I needed. 

For most batches, I was needing 11 to 12 gallons of water. So, I would get 10 gallons of RO at the grocery store and top off with 1 gallon of well water. Well, all of the initial batches of my new, expensive system sucked. Like, bad beer, man. All beers had this awful, lingering bitterness that was not hops. I blew 3 or 4 batches of just barely drinkable, bitter crap. It was pretty upsetting; I had gone from making pretty decent beer on a very basic setup, to making very bad beer on a complicated setup that I splurged on. I was willing to try anything, and, on a Hail Mary, I bought a small RO system for the house, so I could always have as much RO as I wanted. Without that 1-2 gallon top off, my beer was back to normal. 

The TLDR/conclusion here is that just 10% of your water being not up to brewing standards can really get you. I encourage anyone getting into brewing to go with RO as not to be potentially discouraged. I've run out of brewing salts before, and straight RO water makes fine beer (there are exceptions, of course). It'll be better than what I was putting out with a ratio of 10:1 RO to tap, anyway.",Homebrewing

"Mash water volume (water/grain ratio) - new all grain brewer missing the mark. Recently upgraded my hot side to a fancy single vessel set up from Spike. I was using a large pot on the stove.

On the new single vessel, I can fit all of the water (including predicted losses) with all of the grain into the kettle.

This obviously shifts the grain water ratio - and I‚Äôm left wondering if this has unintended changes to the mash.

"A week on I'm finally ready to share the mishaps from my 1st all grain brew day It has been a week since I used my new BrewZilla to make my first ever all-grain brew, and it‚Äôs taken me that long to own up to how it went, but I‚Äôve decided to share my toils with you, for your entertainment and to reinforce my lessons learned. 

So the batch I wanted to do was called 'War Priest', taken from Acquisitions Intoxicated, who designed the recipe on their Twitch stream, and based it on one of the characters from the D&amp;D game. The layers of nerding out going on here is something I can‚Äôt go past, and would highly recommend [Acquisitions Intoxicated](https://youtu.be/7v_dJC0AKD8), along with the forbearer D&amp;D game [Acquisitions Incorporated](https://youtu.be/j_fGKY44DaI), to anyone willing to give it a whirl. 

War Priest a **big** beer - a Black IPA aiming at over 8% ABV and 80 IBU. Here's [my Brewfather recipe](https://share.brewfather.app/xuXq2xoiGUUCjF) for it (slightly tweaked from what I actually did for that batch, but not hugely...yet)  

I was (stupidly) aiming for a 23L ferment, which from everything I read about the BrewZilla was near the limits of the grain bill size the 35L vessel will take, but not over it... So fuck it, I went with that rather than scaling down a few litres... because what's the worst that could happen? 

A few notes before I regale you with tails of my woes: 

* I decided to use a BIAB bag underneath the malt pipe for extra filtration, based on the setups from others that I‚Äôve seen online 
* I ordered the grain bill double milled (ie for BIAB) 
* I did not use rice hulls
* the ""[Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Mash Paddle](https://www.kegland.com.au/stainless-steel-mash-paddle-heavy-duty.html)"" from Kegland might be appropriately sized for the 65L version, or for an oversized stock pot feeding the entire crew of an aircraft carrier, but in the 35L BrewZilla it is comically large, almost unusable (learn from me and ignore that piece of advice - stick with a normal sized one!)

Last weekend I finally got time for a brew day, after sitting on the grains and my brand new BrewZilla for over a week. I had tested bringing water up to a boil, and using the immersion chiller, so that I would be comfortable with the process. 

I had also built the recipe into Brewfather, which gave me all sort of information about the process which seemed incredibly helpful. In hindsight, however, I didn‚Äôt know some of the intricacies of the tool, including the Equipment settings and volume limits... What resulted was me having to remove about 4L of mash water to add to the sparge before putting the grains in because I knew it wouldn't fit otherwise. That amount was pretty much perfect, with the BrewZilla tapped out in terms of capacity, and the density of the mash being unpleasant to stir.... (particularly with the 10 tonne mash paddle that couldn't fit sideways in the malt pipe around the middle tube....)

But mash went reasonably, and the colour and smell was perfect, so I'm feeling okay at this stage. So I move onto sparging, using every ounce of strength to be able to pull the malt pipe out of the wort and twist it onto the little ledge thing to drain.

Based on my lack of rice hulls, the ultra fine milling of the grains, and probably the fact that I forgot to recirculate the wort through the mash process, the sparge kept getting stuck. Queue montage of me in my laundry/garage, standing over the BrewZilla, which was propped up on a chair to get better air flow, with the malt pipe resting on top, using the worlds larges mash paddle to gentle try to help the sparging process along... I manage to get almost the whole way through this, having put in all of the sparge water (and extra taken out pre mash), only to make the fatal mistake of not paying enough attention to where the malt pipe 'feet' were on the rails at the top of the kettle. When stirring the incredibly thick grist I must have twisted the malt pipe too much, because malt pipe plus 8.25kg of grain and whatever water weight it had picked up come crashing down back into the wort, splashing about 4L of wort over me, the walls, the washer/dryer, and the whole garage....

From there I was able to pretty quickly pull the malt pipe back out, hose myself down, and start the long process of cleaning the garage thoroughly to remove (what I hope is) all of the sugary, sticky wort that flooded it, but at the end of the process the BrewZilla wasn't having a bar of it, and refused to turn on the heating elements. It took a solid 4 hours of it drying off before I had any luck getting it going again. 4 hours during which I was beating myself up for breaking my brand new brewing tool that I‚Äôd bought as a graduation present for myself, in the first day out of the box! 

But thankfully, after that I was able to complete the brew days otherwise uneventfully.

I hope me owning up to this helps someone avoid a similar fate, or at least makes a few of you laugh.

"Using instant oats for body/mouthfeel with extract brewing? I'm doing a bit of experimenting this weekend. Specifically I'm making a high gravity 12% hoppy saison using some saison yeast with near 100% attention.

I want ensure the beer has some body to it and I've got a shed load of instant oats in my cupboard, which according to numerous posts/forums are absolutely fine to use.

The beer is a light Brooklyn lager is probably the best way to describe the end colour. I'm not too bothered about oaty flavours not working with a hoppy beer or anything like that really, I just don't want it to be thin.

I think I'm mainly interested in just steeping the oats because I'm getting 100% of my fermentables from malt extract and dextrose.

My boil is 7L. Do I steep the oats in this water before starting my boil period?

What should the steeping temperature be? How long? And how much oats?

"8 month old quad is starting to hit it's stride! https://i.imgur.com/1hdIXz1.jpg

Bready and complex with figs and pepper. Fairly dry and refreshing. Effervescent and slightly prickly with alcohol warmth and a medium-light body. Rocky, tan head dissipates after about a minute.

During aging, it lost a little heat and gained a little dried fruit, as well as the flavor becoming more prominent and less muddy.

5.5 gal batch is 16 lbs belgian pilsner, 2.5 lbs d-180 candi syrup. Mash schedule is 60m at 144f, 30m at 150f. First gallon of runnings decocted and boiled separately into a rich mahogany syrup, roughly down to 20% volume. 90m boil. Bittered to 35 IBUs with 1 oz styrian goldings at 15m. Imperial B63 yeast. 64f pitch, raised 2f per day to 80f. 1.098 og to 1.011 fg. Naturally carbonated to 3.2 volumes. Around 12.5% ABV after natural carbonation.

All in all a fantastic beer, but I will be making some changes next time. After doing a side by side with westy, I think I would drop the abv down to 10%ish, use 1 lb d-180, 1 lb d-90, a small touch of special b, work on head retention, and lower the carbonation.",Homebrewing

"Scottish Wee heavy problems Hello All,

I brewed a Scottish wee heavy and it was a problem from the start.

Anyway, I am going to assume 1.065 is still way to high , however , I did squeeze and rinse the hell out of the steeping bags. Is it possible the current high gravity is due to the large amount of unfermentable sugars from my excessive squeezing every last drop out of the special malts ?

"Pitched NEIPA with wrong yeast Hello everyone! This is my first post here, but I've been lurking for some time already and gotta say, this is one of my favourite subs that I follow as people here are so chill and friendly. 

So, I was brewing a sort of NEIPA with my makeshift recipe that I had made once before and which I thought that was pretty okay so I wanted to start improving it. The FU happened when I was pitching the yeast in. I had two jars of yeast in my fridge, and as I am simple person with memory capacity of a bee, I didn't mark the jars for what they contain. Another one was WhiteLabs Vermont Ale, that I used in previous batch and another one was  WhiteLabs German Lager that I used for pilsner. So when it was time to take the yeast out of the fridge, without hesitation I took the jar that I thought was the Vermont Ale yeast and proceeded with that. Next day it just suddenly crossed my mind that I must have taken the wrong yeast. The one that I took was in such a pickle jar that we hadn't ever bought home. I fermented the pilsner at my parents cellar as it has constant temperature of 13C, so pretty okay for pilsner, right. So now I have beer, that was supposed to be sort of a NEIPA fermenting with German lager yeast at 20C. 

The question is, what kind of outcome you would expect of this batch with lager yeast that is fermenting way above its optimal temperature range? Also the last batch had fermented just in time for trip to summer cottage, so I did not have time to dry hop it before it was all gone. Do you think the amount of hops is decent for the beer style? Is there other modifications to this recipe that would make it more like the style it is poorly trying to mimic?

If I have a original gravity of 1.09 with roughly 80% pale malt and 20% caramalt then the estimated final gravity is around 1.015 - 1.02.

"Advice on hop schedule for Session IPA Hello guys, just wanted to ask your thought on this session IPA I have on the works and planning on doing on Sunday, I¬¥ve used this same malt profile and I found it amazing for a session IPA but I am a bit concerned about hops, the last one I did, I used 3 oz of simcoe and amarillo (combined) for flavor and aroma and 3oz combined for dry hop, 10g of warrior for bittering and I felt it lacked a bit of punch and I would like to give it more punch but I am afraid I would overdo it, what do you guys think of my schedule?

Recipe:

19L Batch 

4000 g Briess 2Row 330 g Weyermann Carapils 110 g Weyermann Carahell

3/4oz Centennial@8.2AA at 60 min (18 IBU) (Bittering)

cider doesn't taste like alcohol? I have been fermenting cider in 3 1-gallon containers with regular airlocks. I transferred one gallon to bottles and added sugar in some of them to carbonate but noticed that some foam (krausen?) must have overflowed into the airlock since there seemed to be some sticky residue when I took it off. I tried a bit when I did that and just now tried some from a bottle that I didn't have the priming sugar. Both times I tried it it didn't have that warmth that wine has that I think comes from alcohol. instead it has a rotten flavor. could the sugar have been turned in to something else instead of alcohol?

"Determining off-taste in blue moon clone Hey all,

I made this popular [blue moon clone](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/blue-balls-belgian-wit-blue-moon-clone.24978/) last month. Just kegged it on Monday and had my first sips today and it's the first beer since all grain that I've been really disappointed with, and may have to dump. So I figured I'd try to get to the bottom of it here. There is just this extremely bitter and tangy taste, hardly tastes like beer. The only thing I can think of is that there was too much orange peel OR because I didn't put the orange peel into a muslin bag, instead I just dumped into the kettle and let the carboys sit for about a month? Recipe below...

I made it into an 8.6gal batch (I always do around 9 gal batches because anything more and when I BIAB the grain overflows out of my 15gal kettle) and scaled with beersmith. Recipe as follows:

6lbs 14.4oz flaked wheat

10 lbs 2 row

1.9 oz Willamette

1.29oz Coriander

1.29oz Orange peel, bitter

OG - 1.044, FG - 1.005 (my refractometer was acting up so not 100% accurate on the FG... I need a tilt)

There are 3 slight deviations from the original recipe. The first is the scaling to a bigger batch. Second thing you will notice is my ratio of wheat and 2row is off. I noticed last minute I didn't have enough flaked wheat so I said screw it and just increased the amount of 2 row. 3rd thing is I used Willamette as a sub for Goldings.

Lastly, this is the first batch that I started with RO water and made my own mineral profile, so I could have done this horribly wrong.

Overall, I think it has something to do with the orange peel. Maybe orange peel doesn't scale well in beersmith when increasing batch size? Or maybe the orange peel doesn't work as well with less flaked wheat? Maybe my water profile was off and made it extremely bitter/tangy?

Any suggestions at all, please share!",Homebrewing

"Question about a first time brew This is my first homebrew project so I went for an all-grain american ipa style beer as my first brew (I drink these a lot so I thought I'd be able to tell if it came out well more easily) and I have a couple fo questions regarding it.

1. It appears to have stopped fermenting as there is no activity in the fermenter that I can see anymore even though I'm just under 2 weeks in to the ferment - I felt when I started that I underpitched the yeast so I thought think may have been a cause?
2. I've checked the gravity and it had a gravity of 1.060 when I started the ferment and it now has 1.028 - is that a normal level at this point in the ferment?
3. I tasted a small amount when I checked the gravity and it has quite an alcoholic flavour despite it being only 4.20% (assuming my gravity reading is accurate) I've done some research and I think it may be due to fermenting it at too high a temperature - is there a way to reduce this in the final beer?

"Thanksgiving tomfoolery (advice please) Fianc√© was making cranberry sauce, where you cook cranberries in orange juice until they pop and ta-da sauce. As I was shopping the day before American Thanksgiving (pro move), my only option was an absurdly large bag of cranberries.

My thought: cran-peary __________, with Amarillo hops (for orange-y goodness)

I need help though. My first thought was a session p‚Äôale but I can‚Äôt go too heavy on the hops or else the pear will get lost. Coworker suggested a radler, and if I had to punt maybe a farmhouse? Also I had the thought to get brut yeast, but I could be way off base here.

"Can/should I add more yeast if I screwed up hydrating my dry yeast? Hey, definite noob here, but want to see if anyone has some advice for me in my situation. First time brewing in almost a decade.

Used an extract kit ([Brewer's Best, Imperial Nut Brown](http://brewersbestkits.com/assets/1048_imperialnutbrown_recipe.pdf)) today, and everything went swimmingly during my boil, I cooled my wort down fast with an immersion chiller, and decided to try rehydrating my yeast packet ([this one](https://kamiljuices.com/products/windsoraleyeast)). For some reason, though I knew to warm up the water beforehand, I neglected to do so (used cold brita water). The yeast didn't bubble up at all in the starter glass, and I'm not sure how much action it's had since adding it to the fermenter. I figure I probably killed off a bunch of the yeast by putting it dry into cold water.

I'm curious if it's worth trying/possible at this point to get another packet at my local homebrew shop tomorrow morning and adding that to the fermenter (and starting it correctly this time), or if it's not possible/not worth it at this point (finished brewing about 4 hours ago).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Apologies if this question has been asked a bunch, but I wasn't able to find something relevant with a quick search and am hoping to know what to do before it's too late.",Homebrewing

"Off Flavor Help: Dish Soap Flavor All, I need help on what went wrong with my Altbier. The brew day went well for me hit all my numbers and fermentation was normal. 

I utilized RO water and adjusted with minerals accordingly. Performed a multi-step mash and a 90 min boil. Fermented with 1007 German Ale. 

Fermentation finished up in about 7 days (3 Gallon batch). I moved it to secondary to lager for 3 weeks. I pulled a sample during the initial transfer and the beer had no malt/hop flavor at all, I thought it was very odd.  At that time I noticed the beer had a dish soap flavor to it and hoped it would go away with time. It hasn‚Äôt :(

I clean everything with PBW, never with dish soap! 

Googled the off-flavor but what I read that describes ‚Äúsoap‚Äù does not seem to be my issue, long storage of the beer on the trub.

The grains were about 2 weeks old from the time I got them milled and was able to brew. Could this be a culprit? And why doesn‚Äôt the beer have any flavor, it‚Äôs almost flat tasting, zero malt or hop flavor.

"Idea for a radiator immersion chiller Hello, dear brewers.

My vocabulary isn‚Äôt all that great when it comes to homebrewing, but I‚Äôll do my best to try and explain my idea to you.

So basically me and my dad have been having some issues with our DYI immersion cooler. It didn‚Äôt work as effectively as we had hoped it would, meaning that we had to pump the wort super slowly in order to reach the right temperature.

We‚Äôve been back and forth trying to solve this issue, and dad thinks he might be able to improve the effect by increasing the length of the immersion cooler by 3 meters or so.

My idea however, is a bit different. Now I know what you think, but this is NOT just another guy who thinks simply running the wort through a radiator would solve problem. I do not intend to die of lead poisoning. 

What do you think about replacing the water that usually runs through the immersion cooler, with a coolant, and then run the coolant through a radiator?",Homebrewing

"Biscoff lemon cheesecake(?) Sour Thought i would share my first original recipe which i have put on this weekend.

Started out as a straight lemon sour made from a post i found on reddit to test souring out. 4.5kg marris otter mashed then soured using sourpitch and kept at 32 degrees using a fishtank heater until ph hit 3.1 before boiling, lemon peel @ 10 mins and fermented out with us 05.

Trial went well but it was very straight, sharp and sour. Wanted to add more of a dessert feel to it so i have added 250g of biscuit malt and 500g of biscoff biscuits to the mash along with 250g of toasted oats for a creamy mouthfeel.  Soured to 3.1 again and boiled for 60 min.

Hopped with 25g of cascade and simcoe and 50g of citra, 1/3 of these at 10 mins remaining along with lemon peels and 1/2 whirlfloc.

Will dry hop in secondary with the remaining 2/3 of hops and 500g of lactose to add to creaminess and give a base of unfermentable sweetness along with more lemon peels.

Smelled great going into the fermenter, i find sours take a while for fermentation to start but hopefully this will kick off later today.

I tried to return the 5 extra but they said to just keep them. I then had the problem if what to do with 18 liters worth of flasks, then I had an idea.

 The end result was that I got to taste all these beers, with the only difference being the yeast used, head to head to see which I preferred.

This allowed me to choose the exact yeast I want to use for this beer moving forward to get the best results for my tastes.

"Protecting electronics dangling in a fermenter I'm looking at dangling a couple [these pressure sensors](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mki183v1.html) inside a fermenter at different depths, in hopes that watching the difference between the two will indicate the SG of the brew, or even if it's not that accurate, the graph over time will tell me when the brew is done moving.

The sensor itself is gel potted and supposed to be able to survive chemicals - chlorinated water, beer. The circuit board, however, is most definitely not.

So I'm thinking of soldering it up, attaching a little snorkel to the sensor (that smokestack on it is about 2mm diameter), and then slathering it all with food-safe silicone.

I'm in Australia. Anyone have any idea where I can get/what kind of silicone to use?

FG is yet to be determined as I broke my glass hydrometer.

Next time I'd add some Irish moss at the end of the boil for clarity. There's a strong resinous mouth feel and taste, but there's also some reasonable tropical aromas as well.

This is obviously a starting point that could either be improved or simply never be brewed again and burn all evidence that there was ever any attempt.

"Can I 'top up' a keg with more beer? A month ago I brewed 26L of dry irish stout, split into 2 13L batches and after fermentation I kegged one while I added some habanero and cacao nibs to the other still in primary. I've drunk maybe 3/4 of the batch I kegged and it's decent albeit not perfect. The chilli beer has just a tad more bite than I wanted and am wondering if since the current keg doesn't appear to have any infection/is sterile, whether there is any issue just racking straight on top of the beer already in there and if there are any methods that would assist in making sure the process stays sanitary?",Homebrewing
"2nd Batch of Cider. Thoughts, opinions, ideas? I have only made one batch of cider in the past. I used pie apples from a tree at my parents' house, and added a lot of water and brown sugar because the yield was so low. I carbed with carb drops, and it came out... average. I only fermented for about 2 weeks. Cider was pretty dry, had some slightly funky aftertaste, but it was drinkable. Not particularly sparkling. 

Now, I've had a 4.5 gallon batch of cider going for almost 7 weeks in primary. I crushed and pressed a few different varieties of apples from a local orchard. I added raw honey as well, no water. I tasted it over the weekend and it's pretty decent- quite dry. Girlfriend doesn't like it as much as week two lol. 

I put my fermenter in the fridge today to cold crash the cider. My plan is to cold crash for 2 days, and then add 1 frozen apple juice concentrate as primer to the cider and let it dissolve. Then rack, to my bottling bucket, and bottle. I was going to put some in a plastic bottle to squeeze every day until it was firm, and then pasteurize all of the bottles. My goal is to have a strong, sparkling, slightly sweet cider, and from all my reading I think I have a decent plan?

Anybody have experience priming with apple juice concentrate? Anyone have good or bad experiendes with an extended primary and no secondary? Tips on pasteurizing?

P.S. I don't have any gravity readings- I just purchased a hydrometer, so in the future I'll be sciencing harder. Right now, I'm just going for ""about right""",Homebrewing

"Stainless steel keg pasteurization process. I wanted to share a pasturization process that I've been doing with good sucess using hot water. I'm only posting this because I've read a lot of posts saying that 1. it is not possible, or 2. not practical. For my purposes,  I do this to back sweeten my ciders and preserve them without restarting the fermentation process.  I like to age my ciders for a few months so they mellow out, and lastly I like to keep enough drink stored so I don't run out. So a shelf life is what I want without using additional chemicals. 

***ATTENTION***
I don't know if i need to put a disclaimer to tell people to be careful around extremely hot liquids and potentially heavy objects involved in the process. So with anything, please take extreme care when proceeding with the following if you were to try it. I am not liable for your injuries or damages to your equipment. I am sharing my experiences using my equipment at my own risk. So use your best judgment during the process. 
***ATTENTION***

The kegs involved are 5 one gallon stainless steel (SS) kegs, and two 5 gallon Northern Brewer SS kegs with rubber bottoms. The one gallons have a ball-lock system attached to the head during the process.

The smaller kegs will sit in a medium size pot filled with enough water a few inches from the top of the pot. The 5 gallon kegs will sit in an 8 gallon pot with the water line a few inches from the top as well. The top half to 1/3 of my kegs are not usually submerged. 

Bringing water to a boil, I'll take the pot off the heating element and slowly insert the keg. The temperature will start to drop rapidly as the keg warms up, usually setteling at about 140*F.  When the temperature of the water drops below 140*F, replace upto half of the water with fresh boiling water to bring it back up passed 160*F.

The pasteurization time and temperatures are 30 mins at ~140*F using the slow low temp method, and 15 seconds at ~160*F using the faster method according to this article by Britannica. [links here.](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pasteurization)
There are higher temperatures to pasteurize at, but i do not feel comfortable at higher than 170*F.

I will usually keep this up for 10 minutes, or until the top part of the keg that is not sumberged reads to about 160*F. At this point I am fairly confident that the cider is now pasteurized. I have done this and kept ciders for about 8 months now and have not had any restarted fermentation with added sugars, nor have I had any infections. 

As for the kegs, they both seem to be doing well and show that they can tolerate pasteurization temperatures. The rubber bottom on the 5 gallon kegs seem to be okay, without any obvious signs of ware. But i always figured i could just glue them back on again if they ever came off.

"Time is a wonderful thing I was looking for some carpet cleaner and I stumbled upon 2 bottles I put in a closet almost 2 month  ago. I put them there because they were going to be my ""taste test"" bottles to see if they were ready to drink yet. As a new brewer, I find myself testing a bottle every week until I deem it acceptable and then consider it ""ready for consumption"". I remember these beers, I was really proud of them because they were the first 2 I was making the recipe on my own (not a kit) and started experimenting with hops. 

Simple Saaz and Simple Cascade. 

Oh boy, how much better these are after almost 2 months of bottle conditioning. The head still hasn't gone away after sitting for a few minutes and having drank half the glass. I remember drinking them when I decided they were ""ready"" and they had a little bitter bite to it. I just assumed that was the taste of those hops and how it's supposed to be.

"Speidel Cap + Gas Bulkhead Mod for Oxygen-Free Transfers My usual fermentor to keg transfer involves a purged keg with silicone tubing  leading from my Speidel fermentor‚Äôs spigot straight to the bottom of my keg through the lid opening, with a cap loosely fitted to the top of my fermentor so as to not create a vacuum during transfer.  

I‚Äôve noticed recently that less than 5 gallons of beer in my fermentor often leads to air getting sucked into the keg at the tail end of the transfer. Very likely a mixture of CO2 and oxygen. The latter not being so great for my hoppy beers. This cap with gas bulkhead mod helps alleviate that. I now hook up one line from my CO2 tank to my keg and one line to my fermentor pushing about 1-2 psi into both, with keg lid off and screw cap on Speidel loosely fitted. This helps mitigate, if not eliminate, any potential oxygen ingress by pushing any air out from both the fermentor and keg during transfer.  

Gas bulkhead from MoreBeer. Used a 1/2‚Äù hole punch on the cap to fit the bulkhead. Hope this helps someone out there!

"Beer temperature and cloudiness Ok storytime/rant/question so beer with me.
its close to my 12th batch and I always serve my beer (bottle conditioned/ priming) at 4¬∞c cause thats the way i like it, but my brother likes it stupidly cold and so he places it in the freezer for a couple hours max before drinkin(as much as he can get away with before it freezes solid) and its always been close to cristal clear, but now he got a temperature controlled beer fridge and he set the thing to -2¬∞c and naturally leaves every bottle in there. All my bottles that stayed on that temperature for more than a day were never the same again. Its cloudy, and it has a flavour thats off but i cant quite put my finger on it. 
First thing i thought it was chill haze, but if that was the case it should return to normal after warming right? Also it should not affect flavour.
Now i think it might be dead yeast. But it if the water never actually crystallized it should not have damaged their cells walls.
Its driving me crazy my beer is good otherwise. Why is prolonged exposure to near freezing making it bad? why only after bottle conditioning and not during the cold crash? Why is it even popular to drink beer stupidly cold?",Homebrewing
"Just finished my 2nd batch with all-in-one and I'm having trouble with water amount and/or boil-off rate So I just finished my 2nd batch with Brew monk (/hopcat) 30 liter version. I already made an excellent porter/stout and now I tried to make an quadrupel. I use the Brewfather app for amounts.

The Brew monk has a water level meter on the side, which I rely on. I measure my mashing water amount, pre-boil and boil amount with it. The thing is, when I sparge the water level indicator tells me it's missing a good amount of water. Today it was missing about 4 liters. So I sparged it with 4 liters more. This got me to preboil amount of about 26 liters as it should have, as I was aiming at 20 liters to fermenter. Well I brought it to boil and let it boil for an hour. The water level indicator said 24.5 liters and my fermenter agreed to that amount after I moved it to there, also gravity was way too low. So according to my masher the boil-off is about 1.5 liters/hour (that would be only  0.4 gallons/hour)

Same-ish thing happened with the 1st batch (It was a group thing, pre-made bewerages were supplied, so this isn't very scientific). It was sparging too low volume according to the Brew monk, and we sparged it a little bit more and again it resulted to too low gravity and bigger batch. As this was a lower ABV beer we managed to fix it a little with sugar and it turned out great.

TL;DR: I get too low pre-boil volume according to my masher's volume indicator, sparging more leads to said sparging water adding up to fermenter volume, **but** pre-boil volume is ok. Gravity is also too low.

PS. Can some one point me to a good non-biab sparging tutorial, that would be compatible with all-in-one malt pipe? I tried watching the grainfather video, but I don't feel like it told me what to actually do. Or I think I might have had stuck sparge twice now.",Homebrewing

"Questions about infections. I'm sorry. Firstly, I'm not worried. This isn't a panic post. I am indeed relaxing and having a homebrew, but I still have some questions about infections.

So, I am aware that the cooldown period is when the wort is most vulnerable, and that keeping a sanitized lid on the pot is important. I'm confident that all my equipment was sanitized, and that the wort was poured into the fermenter without contamination. 
Brewday was on Saturday (11/21/2020), and the fermenter spent all of Sunday bubbling away, which I was glad to see. Forums outside of reddit say that the yeast have now established their ""reign"" at this point, and infections (that is, if enemies are present at all) are unlikely. It is also said that the alcohol produced will also help prevent infections. In this, I am also confident that there is *some* alcohol present in the fermenter, though probably not the amount I want for the final product (OG: 1.094; target FG: 1.013; 11.5g US-05 at a terrible 71¬∞F).
However, I did take out the rubber stopper and the airlock because it was getting gunky. I took sanitizer and soaked the area around the hole before taking it out, and Star San'd the crap out of my hands, the stopper, and the airlock‚Äî especially the underside part that points inside the fermenter‚Äî before putting it back. I think I did a good job with sanitizing, and I think an infection is unlikely. 

Here are my questions: 

1. Is a whole day of bubbling a sign of a healthy fermentation, and should I be confident that the beer is doing fine and that infections have been avoided for now? 

2. Is it true that yeasts can establish their ""reign"" and prevent other microorganisms from taking over, or can infections occur at the same time as an active/healthy fermentation period? 

3. If other microorganisms take over before the yeast gets to work, should I be looking for signs like weak bubbling or no bubbling at all? This is assuming I maintain a proper temperature and added an appropriate amount of yeast.  

4. If on bottling day I discover an infection, is it worth scooping out that film of white fuzz that I seen in pictures of actual beer infections? I hate the idea of dumping 4 gallons of 2 weeks of my life and $30 worth of malt, so I was wondering if there are remedies to this problem. I also don't want to open the lid, so I really have no way of seeing what's happening inside (it's a white bucket). 

5. How much alcohol does it take to protect the fermentation process? Similarly, if the alcohol floats to the top, why do pictures of infections show the spread of bacteria *on the top* of the beer? I guess this question is linked to questions 2 and 3, but I'm not sure. 

That's all the questions I have for now, but I'll probably reply with more in the comments.

"PSA: Refractometers/Hydrometers will have different accuracy levels depending on both temperature and alcohol content. Calculators provided within. Simply put, alcohol interferes with the readings of a refractometer and temperature interferes with the accuracy of a hydrometer.    


Pre-fermentation you may be seeing different values between your hydrometer and refractometer because your probably testing the gravity of HOT wort. You'll need a [Hydrometer Temp Correction Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/hydrometer-temp/) to get a bit more accurate of a reading between the two. Refractometers normally have ATC (Automatice Temperature Correction) up to a certain degree (which is normally above normal mash temps, depending on the quality of your device).  

Post-fermentation may be showing different values between your devices because ALCOHOL interferes with the accuracy of a refractometer. In this scenario, you'll need to use your hydrometer (as normal fermentation temps are well within the temp range needed for accurate hydrometer readings) or use a [Refractometer Alcohol Correction Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/refractometer-calculator/) to get a reading that would match your hydrometer.  

In short, some of the better advice you'll get is to use your refractometer during production and use your hydrometer post fermentation when you're doing your logs.

"Broken Thermometer So I‚Äôm coming here with basically a question, but also looking for some reassurance. I HAD a glass thermometer as you will see in the link, and I put it in the wort right before I was transferring to a bucket just to make sure the temp I was getting on the digiboil read out was accurate enough to pitch my yeast. As soon as I got it half way in the wort, I heard a *tink* and then a bunch of smaller tinks, which confused me. But after I thought about it for a second I pulled the thermometer out of the wort and sure as shit it had busted and dropped all the things out of the bottom. 

The thought of dumping it passed my mind, but screw that after just brewing for 5 hours. So I transferred to my bucket and pitched the yeast and all. 

My question is, what are those little beads and should I really worry about them/will they mess me up if i let them sit in primary for the next few weeks? 

I planned on just going on as usual, fermenting in primary a few weeks(I‚Äôm doing a tripel), cold crashing, and then transfer to a keg. Also I think it‚Äôs important to note when I was cleaning my kettle after, in the bottom I‚Äôm assuming was 90% + of those beads that fell out.

"Jalape√±o Pale Ale help I grow my own hot peppers. Last few years I‚Äôve made jalape√±o beers.  First batch was an amazing saison (and I lost the recipe).  My last 2 batches were IPA‚Äôs that were good, but not great. First batch too sweet (1# of C60, 9# 2row, 1# wheat), and same with the second (0.77# of C40, 7.5# 2row, 1.33# wheat, .66# flaked wheat).  Second batch I mashed too high (153), so that I‚Äôm going to fix. 

I want to do something lighter (2nd batch was boozy).  But I want some bready backbone for the jalape√±o flavor to grab.  And it needs to have some body so it doesn‚Äôt taste like jalape√±o water. 

My recipe: 5# 2row, 2# wheat, 3# Munich light. Mash at 150f. 75min boil. Cascade to bitter (38IBU) and Saaz at FO for aroma. 2 jalape√±o at 1min.  2 jalape√±o in secondary.  

My question:  how much light Munich too much??  Should I inverse the wheat/Munich??

Not going to dry hop this one (did the other 2), because I‚Äôm hoping the peppers shine more.  So more of a pale ale vs IPA.

"HEX Heat Exchanger and Automated Brewing I had this idea a few days ago, and after a bit of searching found this old project: https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/pimp-my-system/hex/

For the homebrewer this should be just as effective as a HLT but much smaller (though I expect about the same cost).

I should say I'm a total amateur brewer (just a few BIAB batches) but I have a fair amount of automation, electrical and electronics experience. So assume I won't have any issues with the electrical/electronics side.

This is what I cam up with for an almost fully automated brewing system.
https://i.imgur.com/F0IHkIq.png

The HEX heat exchanger on the left would have a high wattage heater (possibly 9kw) it can pre-heat any incoming water (for this setup assume tap water) and direct it to the Mash Tun (or the Brew Kettle. Liquid from the Mash Tun can can be circulated though the HEX acting as a HERMS system. 

The hex can of course supply heated water for cleaning and circulated though everything before draining. 

I think this will allow an almost automated brew (aside from grain, hops etc). But I don't have any experience with thee pot brewing.",Homebrewing

"Easy Non-Brew Hard Seltzer After a couple of failed attempts to brew a seltzer, probably a nutrient deficiency that caused the batches to stall fermentation, I ended up with this tried and true hard seltzer cocktail recipe inspired by Brulosophy. I‚Äôve now made about 10 batches, and each one has been pretty damn good, especially the watermelon batch. 

Recipe:  
2,625 mL of Vodka (exactly 1.5 handles of vodka)  
2 - 4oz fruit flavoring (check with your preferred LHBS for flavoring options)  
500 gm Sugar  
50 gm Malic Acid  
Top keg off with RO or distilled water  

Notes:  
Ensure to blend well. I add the Flavoring, Malic Acid, Sugar, and filled the keg half way with water. I then stirred with a drill-attached mixer from NorCal Brewing Solutions. Mix well enough to dissolve sugar and acid. Add vodka, top off with water, blend for just a bit more to homogenize what is pretty much a cocktail in a keg. ABV is about 5.6%.  

Feel free to adjust sugar and acid levels to your liking. These measurements are perfect for my liking, and those that have had the honor to try my hard seltzer.  

Super easy, super cheap, and a good beer alternative, though beer still reigns supreme.

"What is a brewer to do when not making beer? Here's a funny little question that's probably borderline off topic - hope the sub doesn't mind.

I love homebrewing. Like a lot. Every single time I finish brewing a beer I clean up and put everything away while thinking to myself: *""Aw, we're done already?"".* I love the process - sitting outside, enjoying the weather even if it's bad, BBQing up some hamburgers or hotdogs while the mash is doing it's thing, all while drinking the homebrew I made a month or so ago. My local homebrew supply store even knows me by name I'm in there so much.

I try to keep myself from brewing more than once a week - any more than that and I just have too much beer. I know I can do smaller batches, or give more of my beer away. But I'm beginning to wonder what other things I can be doing during the week that will satisfy my itch to brew - or is it just a craving to create?

I recently saw a few videos by people who have their own pizza ovens. They made their own dough, rolled out their own pizzas and covered them with homemade sauces and ingredients. I realized that pizza making would probably be a fun thing for a brewer to try - it would be something I could iterate and experiment on through new techniques and ingredients - just like homebrewing.

**I would love to hear what hobbies other homebrewers are into and enjoy doing while not brewing?** I personally enjoy making jerkies in my food dehydrator and am seriously thinking about giving pizza making a try. What about you?",Homebrewing

"Dual Body Regulator to Secondary Bank Hey homebrewers. I am new to kegging and I was able to get my hands on 2 different CO2 regulators. A single body dual guage and a dual body regulator. I have been using the single body regulator, and would like to use the dual body one, however it is too heavy for my 5lb CO2 tanks. I was wondering if it is plausible to convert the dual body to a 2 way secondary setup by throwing a plug where the high pressure guage is and swapping the tank connector for a 5/16 hose barb, then mounting that inside my kegerator. Would this work, or is there some fundamental difference between how a primary and secondary regulator is made?

My input was that CO2 build up causes carbonation and could make a bottle bomb but doesn't kill the yeast. Alcohol past it's tolerance, heat, or potassium/sodium metabisulfite will kill it. Even if all the sugars are fermented out to dry most of the yeast falls out but there is enough (maybe dormant idk) that if you add sugar it will kick back up (such as to prime a beer for carbonation).

* W34/70 fermented at 50F x7 days, free rise to 70F x7 days, diacetyl test, then cold crash and package.

"How Long Should My 2.5lb CO2 Tank Last? Hello fellow homebrewers,

I have been brewing hard cider for just about a year now. I carbonate all my cider and have a kegerator setup. It has been going well, and I have really been enjoying this new hobby. That being said, lately I feel my CO2 has been running out extremely fast. In the past, I could get 3-4 corny kegs carbonated, then dispensed from my kegerator with a single 2.5lb CO2 tank. Now I am having to refill my CO2 every 1.5-2 kegs.

To get into specifics, I generally will force carbonate my corny keg at 23 PSI for about 3 days. Then I lower the pressure to 8 PSI for serving. I checked my keg and CO2 regulator for leaks and found none. Is it possible CO2 is seeping out through my liquid line? I am under the impression that would make cider come out of the tap if that‚Äôs the case.

Just wondering if anyone else has had much experience with this and if I should really need to be exchanging my CO2 tank as often as I am? Might be time to upgrade to a 5lb tank for carbonating and use my 2.5lb for serving from the kegerator.

Whenever I dispense the beer, nothing but head comes out, even though there's a solid stream of beer leading up to the tap.  The resulting beer is almost totally flat.

This also happened when I did an initial test of the keg by pouring in a bunch of hard and pressurizing at ~10 PSI, so I don't think it's my beer.

I thought this might be due to adding too much pressure, but even if I almost totally depressurize and let the beer sit for a few hours, I get the same effect when the beer comes out slowly.  This is really disappointing because I'm wasting a bunch of beer and I feel like I can't enjoy it.

"Help me do a post mortem I've just dumped my second batch of 19l of beer after failing for the second time with the same exact recipe (English ale). It's a very simple recipe:

4.5kg Maris Otter

28g EKG at 60m
2g chinook at 60m

"Bottling yeast experiment result A while ago I posted here about a tripel karmeliet i was brewing and wheter or not the yeast from fermentation would be able to bottle condition or if I needed to add a bottling yeast. (https://old.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/jd0dse/i_should_repitch_yeast_for_bottling_right/) 

This is a pretty anecdotal experiment so do consider it as such.

What I ended up doing is splitting the batch, adding a tiny bit of cbc-1 to half the batch.
It's now been 4 weeks (also tasted both at 3 weeks) and the results have left me with more questions that before.

for priming sugar, I used candi syrup diluted in water (aiming for 3 volumes of C02)

the bottom line is both batches carbonated just fine, the added yeast was not needed:
- at 3 weeks the cbc-1 batch had great carbonation, whereas the other one wasn't quite there
- at 4 weeks it's hard to tell the difference with regards to carbonation

now here's the part I don't quite understand :
- the batch that did NOT receive cbc-1 has more yeast deposits in the bottles
- the batch that did NOT receive cbc-1 is very slightly sweeter (enough that I can consistently detect it in a blind test)

I'm guessing that could be explained by the different yeast behavior. it's also possible that I didn't have a consistent product between the two batches, as i transfered the cbc-1 batch from the fermenter first, so I guess it could have had more stuff towards the bottom.

Also for a futur batch, I'd aim for a lower carbonation, there's a lot of yeast in these bottles and the high carbonation tends to swoosh things around making it less pleasant.",Homebrewing

"Relatively new to brewing, question about liquid yeast starter vs dry yeast I am a relatively new homebrewer, have done 4 batches in total strictly following recipes from kits. I've been using liquid yeast but was not making a starter since the recipe didn't call for it. When I started to read about it, it definitely seems like I have probably been underpitching for some of the batches because of it so I ordered a stir plate, flask, DME... all the fixings to do a starter in the future.

But from what I can tell, newer brands of dry yeast like Fermentis are just as effective without the need for a starter or even necessarily to be rehydrated, and for higher gravity brews you can just add a second pack.

My question is, other than personal preference and availability of different yeast strains, is there any real difference between using liquid yeast with a starter to increase cell count compared to using dry yeast and adding an extra packet to increase cell count?",Homebrewing

It was a kit from northern brewers that I got from my lovely BF for my birthday! I am brewing a hefeweisen. I think it mostly went according to plan except for a few things -

1. I spilled about a half cup of the malt syrup (on the floor, ugh), will this affect the brewing process?
2. I left the wort to cool in the sink with ice and water, and didn't realize our sink doesn't exactly hold water well and it was sitting without ice water for about 10 min before I realized. I filled it back up with water but ended up trying to cool it for about 30 extra minutes. The lid was on the pot for most of the time except when I was checking it. Should this affect it either?
3. My instructions didn't say anything about checking the temp or abv or anything at any point. When are the key times to take any sort of measurements?

Thanks in advance! This process kind of felt like a hot mess, I can't wait to try it again and hopefully do it better next time.",Homebrewing
"testing store-bought juice for preservatives before starting a big batch of wine There are four kinds of juice in my local supermarket (in Istanbul) and they all list no preservatives. Experience has taught me that they might, in fact, have unlisted preservatives in them which will prevent fermentation. 

I plan to pitch yeast in sugar-water with some energizer (I don't trust my yeast, either) and then add it to four glasses of juice. If it bubbles, that would be the juice that I go with. 

Can I put the yeast into straight 100% juice, or should I dilute it to a particular specific gravity even just for a test? (Added complication: my hydrometer broke and the new one is going to take a few weeks to get here.) I'm guessing it needs a little extra sugar, as wine usually starts at 1.08 and the internet says that regular juice is around 1.05.

"Maple + Secondary + ABV + Math = ? I blindly poured 2 lbs 12 oz maple syrup into 4.75 gal of stout. 

The stout was at1.023 (started at 1.108).

I didn't stir or take a second reading - wanted to minimize oxygen exposure and didn't have the option of gassing off. 

In Beersmith in a blank recipe set for a 4.75 gal batch with no trub loss, I entered 2.75 lbs maple and nothing else. 

It said that would result in 1.017 OG and est ABV of 2.8%

Ten days later, and now the stout appears to be at 1.024.  I'm assuming that means the maple fermented out dry.  Maybe it keeps going, I'll check back.  In the meantime, when it DOES reach a point of terminal gravity, do I add the estimated 0.017 gravity points to the OG, the 2.8% to the ABV calculation using the OG and FG, or is there another method  I should be implementing (other than adding the syrup, stirring, and taking a measurement then as well, which...I'll probably do next time).

"I Need Advice For My ""All Up E√ëO Beer"" Recipe. After making a few gallons of Meads and Beers. I decided that I wanted to *make one.* I had two all grains under my belt, and I felt like with my research and knowledge, I could make my own all-grain brew, from complete scratch. I was partially correct.

**My Goal** 

I set out with the idea that I was going to make a highly drinkable, jalapeno ale. Since really nobody else online was doing what I wanted to make,  I toyed with the process of adding peppers and spice to make the brew spicy enough to *tingle* (not burn) and feel like it was warming. A very fine line I know. 

**The Process**

I started with a 4 Cup batch. it was seriously weird but I wanted to make a super small batch before I made a gallon or two of it.  The yield was 2.5 cups of questionable albeit very good beer. my main issue with that small of a batch was dealing with the yeast cake, clarity, and headspace. That first batch was honestly pretty good and was too spicy with the addition of habanero peppers as well as jalapeno, but I needed to make that batch and I'm glad I did, I saw a lot of issues with the original recipe and made the necessary changes. The first things I attempted to correct were the lack of mouthfeel, clarity, head retention, and obviously lower the spice.

After that, I waited a few days and made a 2-gallon batch with the necessary adjustments. Due to the micro-batch that the first one was, I now had really abnormal measurements that needed to be converted, which worked out in the end so, sorry when you read the ingredients and wonder wtf I was thinking using cups instead of gallons, or Tbsp instead of cups. This batch went amazingly. The process was easy, smooth, and could not have been better, It clarified perfectly too as a perfect jalapeno color. I bottled and let carbonate for 3 weeks, and then tested the first bottle. 

**The Results that I need help with**

What I got was a mostly clear, beer with a 1-1.5 inch head that was completely gone within 30 seconds. A mouthfeel that was best described to be ""If Budlight had an anorexic cousin"" but ""great flavor and spice"". The spice was perfect. A warm tingle in the back of your throat and tongue, that never built past that. It aged amazingly and was at its best around the 3-month mark but I did leave them all in a fridge the entire time after their carbonation stage. But the biggest issues that need to be addressed are Head retention, Mouthfeel, and clarity. 

If you could please let me know what needs to be changed to fix these issues, and if you are able to try it out yourself, please do and let me know how it went. I'm going to list the ingredients below, I haven't toyed with using xanthan gum (I still don't think I want to) and I'd like to stay as close to the original as possible, the flavor was amazing, I just need to know what to do to fix these issues. I do use Irish sea moss as a clarifier. With this current configuration, I get an almost champagne effect with the carbonation after the head is completely gone.

**Ingredients List/Recipe**

2 Gallons Recipe for ""All Up E√ëO Beer""

* 34.5 cups of purified water
* 1 Cup of Rice
* 4 Cups of oats
* 12 Cups of Light Caramel Malt
* 4 Tbsp of Ginger Powder
* 2 Tbsp of Fresh ginger
* 12 Tbsp of DME (Sparkling Amber)
* 1.5 Cups of Honey (Clove)
* 2 Large Jalapenos split in quarters (during the entire boil)
* 1 Cup of Brown Sugar 
* 1 Tbsp of Hallertau Hop Pellets
* Nottingham Ale Yeast

OG- 1.049

FG- 1.017

ABV \~4.3%

Mash at 154¬∞F (68¬∞C) for 60 minutes. Mash out at 168¬∞F (76¬∞C), Bring to a rolling boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at 35 minutes from the end of the boil. Chill wort to 86¬∞F (30¬∞C) and pitch yeast. Ferment in primary at 68¬∞F (17¬∞C) until an FG of 1.017 is achieved. Bottle with 7 Tbsp of White Granulated Sugar, dissolved thoroughly and age for at least 3 weeks.

Note: I cold crashed before bottling to better the clarity however, I was still left with a less than Opaque brew.

**Final Thoughts**

Thank you so much for any help or even just reading. I'm not highly experienced however use brewing as a decompression method and I really enjoy learning about the process. It's incredibly fascinating and I love the history and science behind it. Any help is appreciated, Thank you again, and have a great day!",Homebrewing
"All grain noob question: mash thickness I have a question which seems pretty basic, but I can't find a good answer in my books or online. I'd appreciate it if someone can point me in the right direction!

What criteria determine your starting mash thickness? Most brewers seem to choose something like 1.25 or 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grist, but the choice seems almost arbitrary.

My assumption is that thickness of less than 1 qt/lb  would just be too thick to work with. I also understand the practical need to start with a thick mash if you're infusing for several rests. 

A ratio of 3 qt/lb is sometimes given as an upper limit, but I have no idea why.  Is it too thin to form a good grain bed? So much water in the first runnings that you won't be able to  include enough water in the sparging process?

Is there something that I'm missing? Some actual, noticeable effect on flavor or body? Why don't we always use, say, 1.25 qt/lb?

Thank you!",Homebrewing
"Fermenting after FG is reached Recently I have had some yeasty tastes in my beers, I am wondering if it might be due to bottling in 6 days and not letting it go longer in the fermenter even when FG is reached. Will this help at all to settle out more yeast or am I being crazy?",Homebrewing
"Yeast CO2 Production This is going to sound stupid but is there a definite point where no further CO2 will be produced by the yeast and if so is this the ultimate indication of complete fermentation?  Does yeast produce CO2 while ""cleaning up"" at the end of fermentation? Does it produce CO2 while breaking down diacetyl?

Reason I ask is, I have a ball valve on my blowoff tube. I got the idea of closing that for 4-5 hours after my SG was stable. Then I'll open it and see how much gas was generated. I don't have time to stare at the blowoff tube for a bubble that might only be generated once every 20 minutes. I'm assuming there will be a point where no more gas is generated and then I'll know fermentation is 100% complete but I need this thinking to be critiqued.",Homebrewing

"1st Braggot, struggling with hop/malt combinations! 

Hey all!

I‚Äôve been making mead and cider for a while and am looking to make a braggot next. I put this up on the home brewing page because my question is specific to the hops and malts side of things. My recipe so far includes (for a 5gal finish):

3.3lbs Pilsen LME
1lb golden light DME
4-4.5lbs Orange Blossom honey
Possible lemon juice
White Labs WLP570 Belgian Golden Ale Yeast

"Oxidation causing an increase in bitterness? I recently bottled a DIPA, fermented under pressure and DH'ed once during active fermentation, bottled with my beergun and partially bottle conditioned.

It's only been in the bottles for 5 days, carbonation is just fine, but it's already clearly oxidised and the lovely bright hazy yellow now has a prominent orange tint.

I'm getting the usual sort of sweet and muddled hop flavour i wouod expect from an oxidised hoppy beer, but I'm also picking a sort of dry bitterness on the back of my palate, kind of like the bitterness you get from cheap orange juice from concentrate. This bitterness wasn't there when i tasted the beer at bottling, or after 2 days in the bottle. Oxidation has gotten noticeably worse between day 2 and day 5.

Can this bitterness come from oxidation?",Homebrewing

"Stuck fermentation help - I'm definitely making it worse.... Hi all,

I have a \~3gal batch of brown ale in a fermenter. It's temp controlled to 68 F and I added a full smack pack of Wyeast 1028. Almost two weeks later, I checked the FG and it's about 1.030 when it's supposed to be 1.019. 

SO at first I panicked a little and chucked in a pack of Safale-05. Two days after that, still at 1.030. I shook it a little and then realized I probably just oxygenated whatever was in there and so I stopped.

"Eggnog Inspired Beer I know it's a little late but I'm gonna try to squeeze in a holiday beer inspired by eggnog.

For mine, I'm planning to brew a wheatwine, I'm just gonna scale down the ABV to make sure it's ready by Christmas.  As this is my first ever wheatwine, I'm gonna keep the recipe fairly simple: heavy wheat malt (50%+), pils to fill in the rest of the base, a little vienna, and a touch of honey malt.  I also have golden naked oats and flaked wheat on hand.  The GNO are a possible addition but with that high of % of wheat, is it even necessary? Plan on adding vanilla and nutmeg to it, probably in a mix right to the beer and then a tincture at bottling if needed (my preferred method of spicing beers).  I thought about adding cinnamon and clove as well, but I feel like that could cloud the lines between eggnog/pumpkin/spiced ale so I'll likely leave those out.

So, recipe critique? Advice?  If it works out, I'll scale the recipe up for next year and brew it earlier so it'll have ample time to age.",Homebrewing

I tested my new brew kit with a built in grain basket and recirculation pump yesterday.

Whilst I am very happy to be in the estimated ball park figure I was hoping to be even closer, if not bang on. I ran the recirculation pump gently throughout the hour long mash at 68C without much temperature fluctuation (occasionally +/- 1.5C) to ensure consistency throughout the mash.

"Setup advice on first all grain brew I'm doing my first all grain brew and I just wanted to check that there aren't any hidden issues in my method. I'm trying to avoid buying any new equipment so I dug out an electric turkey fryer out of storage that basically works as a 7.5 gallon stovetop kettle with a heating stick. It has a spigot but no false bottom. I feel like this is too small for a 5 gallon BIAB so I was planning to basically do a traditional mash and lauter in this kettle using a paint strainer bag instead of a false bottom. I used brewfather to make the water volumes, I think I input the max volumes correctly.


For a detailed explanation:



1. Heat 4.4 gallons to strike temp in turkey fryer, add bag and grain and mash for 1 hour

1. Heat 2.7 gallons of sparge water

1. Drain wort into separate kettle

1. Batch sparge, drain

1. Remove grain bag and return wort to turkey fryer 

1. Boil, etc...


So my equipment limits my volume to max of 7.5 gallons at any step and I have to use the same container for mashing and boiling. Basically a BIAB with a sparge which as far as I've read only makes it a little more time consuming without any real detriment. The only issue I can see right now is I might overshoot my pre-boil volume if I squeeze the bag (and since this is a stout I've heard that might introduce more bitter flavor) and I can always just boil a little longer if I do. So please let me know if y'all see any issues! Thanks for taking the time.",Homebrewing

"Seltzer Water - Carbonator Question Hey guys, first post here. Thankful to be a part of such a chill community. :) 

I am an insane sparkling water/seltzer addict! I probably drink an average of 48 ounces a day, sometimes more. I have two 5 gallon corny kegs that fit in a Danby kegerator that I got on Craigslist, and recently moved up to a 20lb CO2 tank. I distill my own water too, and I fill the kegs with that.

My only disappointment (which is understandable) is waiting for water to carbonate. I'm familiar with force carbing and shaking the kegs up to speed the process along, plus I will have the other keg already carbed up before I do the next one. However, I'm curious if you had any suggestions using a carbonator to take it to the next level.

My desire is to eventually upgrade to something where my carbonation is instant and I don't have to put forth as much effort. From what I have read, the whole idea of ""instant soda water"" is not cheap to do. If I added a carbonator to this setup... would it be worth it? Would I need to go all out and buy a fountain dispenser and a chiller? Please advise.",Homebrewing
"Belgian Candi Sugar/Syrup Fermentability I'm asking this question because I was unable to find a solid answer online. My question is, ""Does the grade of Belgian candi sugar/syrup affect its fermentability?"" 

BYO states, "" Belgian candi sugar is sucrose that has been caramelized to some degree, depending on the color. Dark candi sugar will have more of a caramel taste than the amber variety. Aside from the caramel notes, it will behave exactly like table sugar.""

From the above, it appears that D-10 is just as fermentable as D-180.  If that's true, then flavors won't be imparted into the final product, just color.",Homebrewing
"WLP500 ensuring there isn't too much banana WLP500 has won more NHC medals than any other Belgian strain by a large margin. This confuses me, because every time I brew with it, I get a *ton* of banana ester, which is not typical of most Belgian beers (I know it's mentioned a couple times in the BJCP guidelines, but if it's there it should be subtle). I ferment this strain, as most people suggest, at 64 F to start and finish a little higher, 68-70 F. Yeast count at 0.75m/ml/P or thereabouts, O2 for a minute for low-med gravity, 2 min for higher gravity. That same process with WLP530 has landed me a gold medal for a tripel the only time I've entered one in a competition. I loved the results. But WLP530, despite being the famous Westmalle/Westvleteren strain, doesn't win many NHC medals.

What gives? Is there something I'm missing with WLP500? Why does it get so much love? Is there a way to use it and get a more typical Belgian ester profile?",Homebrewing

"After 25 years of brewing, I had my first disaster today I‚Äôve been homebrewing for approximately 25 years. 

I‚Äôve had a few stinkers ‚Äì custom recipes that weren‚Äôt nearly as good as I‚Äôd hoped. 

But nothing major has gone wrong. No bottle bombs. No infections. Nothing that made me waste all the work involved in brewing 5 gallons of beer. 

That is... until today. 

My Christmas beer ‚Äì a malty, higher-gravity saison ‚Äì met an untimely end. 

It‚Äôs been a good while since I‚Äôve kegged. For various reasons, I‚Äôve just been bottling over the past year, year and a half. For some reason, the thought of cleaning a keg seemed more daunting than cleaning 50 bottles.

I had a Christmas beer that finished fermenting and a Christmas hard cider I was looking forward to enjoying over the next 34 or so days. 

Three days ago, I put the beer in the newly cleaned keg and lines. I hooked up the gas and gave it 35psi for 2 days to speed-carb it. 

Last night, I dropped down to 14psi, bled off the excess, and poured me a small glass full just to taste. Delicious! Everything I was shooting for. A couple of weeks of aging would do this batch a favor, but it‚Äôs still great as it is. 

Unbeknownst to me, my output connector that hooks into the keg had a crack in it. It must have been from the year+ of lack of use. 

I didn‚Äôt discover this until I came home this evening when I discovered...

Five gallons of delicious beer had leaked out into my brick patio. 

R.I.P. Christmas Saison. 

I‚Äôm unbelievably disappointed. Buying and brewing this was my birthday present to myself (in October). 

It was delicious ‚Äì the small glass I had. I was dreaming of the two different homemade potables on tap during the holiday.

"What to do with a Dry Irish Stout Extract kit? As the title says, I have a dry Irish stout extract kit (well, 3/5'ths of it) that I want to do something experimental with. 

I bought [Northern Brewers Dry Irish Stout kit](https://www.northernbrewer.com/collections/extract-kits/products/dry-irish-stout-extract-kit) a little while back and I didn't want to just make 5 gallons of the exact same thing as it was my first time brewing beer (I've been brewing mainly ciders, meads and wines) so I took 1/5th of the ingredients, made a gallon batch and it was pretty good. I then bought some lactose, found a few recipes for a milk stout and came up with 1/5th of a pound of sugar for a gallon batch, used another 1/5th of the kit, and I also added some cocoa nibs soaked in vodka (also something from a recipe for a chocolate stout) and threw those in secondary. It turned out okay, it's only been 3 weeks and I tried a bottle and it's not the worst beer I've had, but I've run out of ideas on what to do with the rest of it.

I checked and double checked the seals, the airlock and everything seemed air tight. I‚Äôm also fairly confident that I sanitised properly. Could this be oxidisation? An infection? Or has the crystal malt just darkened it more than I expected it to?

I like the way this turned out but was interested in making it slightly more ""creamy"" -- kind of like a Tired Hands IPA (not just the milkshare variety but it seems like alot of their IPAs are more on the creamier side). I did adjust water chemistry the first time, and I got a decent mouthfeel w/ this brew. Would that involve increasing the flaked oat content in the grain bill?

Also, in terms of hops -- a few of my friends have said this is a very high amount of hops for a NEIPA (not sure I agree). It does have a slightly hoppy taste but I was under the impression you need these big dry hops to get that haziness in the beer. Curious if this can be toned down slightly? Was toying with the idea of no hops in the boil and going all whirlpool/dry hop.

I only do partial boils so I guess I will need to take into account the volume of the starter when diluting my wort?

Do I need a starter at all??

"Using bottled water - what adjustments (if any) have you made? I know the mentality has always been, ""if your water is good enough to drink, then it's good enough to brew with"", but I also know that making proper water chemistry adjustments can make a stark difference in the end result of your beer.

For those of you who use bottled water (Poland Spring, Nestle [even though they're terrible], Deer Park, etc.) - what adjustments, if any, do you make to the water? I typically use Poland Spring for my one gallon batches, and carbon-filtered water for my five gallon batches. I'm looking to start utilizing water chemistry in my one gallon batches. Any advice?

"Recalculating my gravity after adding more sugar? Hello Team

I had some weird stuff happen to me recently with this last brew, so bear with me.

First off, this beer I'm doing is a nothing special brown ale - Had it taken off and done everything as expected the final gravity should have been around 5% - (Gravity reading I took was 1.040). I'm about 90% certain I added the liquid yeast to early to everything before sealing it up and potentially thought I had just killed it. So, I let a few days go by and checked the airlock and ... nothing. It wasn't going. I popped it open and it looked like SOME activity had happened, but not a lot. A mild, scummy looking ring around the top, but not much else. Definetly not what I'm used to seeing, especially at this point. SO, I decided to try again with an extra Ale yeast satchel I had. Before that, I mixed in a little sugar mixture (1.5 cups water (warmed) 1 cup sugar, 2 tbsp brown sugar) so this new yeast would have something additional to eat and also took a gravity reading.

So, my OG, prior to adding extra sugar, was 1.040
My current gravity is 1.020

my question is how do I calculate my gravity at this point? 
I'll obviously take a final gravity reading before bottling and all that, but I just want to see if there is some kind of formula I can use for my circumstance? Do I use the 2nd gravity reading? Do I do some kind of subtraction or division?

Any help would be greatly appreciated

"Mash time's effect on attenuation? So I've done a few brews on my Foundry now. Before I had been using a three tiered system, with 60 min mashes and never thought anything of it. But after looking at Beersmith's mash profiles it seems to recommend 90 minute mash's for lighter body beers, and the 75, then 60 as you increase the targeted body for the beer.

Does the mash time actually have a significant effect on the body and attenntuation if you're still hitting the mash temps for that style? For example, on a beer mashed at 156, will it end drier if mashed for 90 instead of 60 min?

I've been doing 90 minute mashes just to get the max efficiency. Just wondering if I can continue that practice?",Homebrewing

"Pump recommendations for moving hot sparge water from Grainfather heater I have a Grainfather and the Grainfather sparge water heater, which is basically just a coffee urn with a spigot at the bottom. I fill it from my RO drinking water tap at my kitchen sink, using a hose with the water heater on the ground. Then I lift it up to the counter, and from there lift it up on top of a sturdy stepstool that is on the counter. Then I plug it in and heat it up. When it‚Äôs time to sparge, I connect a hose to the spigot on the heater and use gravity to run sparge water into the grain basket. 

The problem with this setup is that I have worsening arthritis. It is not easy for me to lift 4 gallons of water up onto the stool on the counter. I also worry about the safety issue of having all of that hot water up where it could in theory get knocked over, though it is pretty sturdy.

What I would like is to be able to keep the water heater on the ground and use a pump to send the hot sparge water up to the grain basket. Self-priming ransfer pumps with racking arms don‚Äôt seem to be able to work with sparge temp water. A wort pump would be OK with the temps but the spigot is only 4 inches off the ground, so I‚Äôm not sure how well they would prime. Plus, there‚Äôs no way to firmly connect a hose to the spigot. Presently I just jam a silicone hose up on there are far as it will go.

So I have used a whole pack of red star yeast in a 100 percent juice bottle. I pour some out to make room for foam etc. Then I add some dissolved sugar about one cup. At first just left it open and waited at least 3 days for that. It did work but yes I am impatient. 
I bought some air locks and idk they don't seem to prove helpful.
I do get buzzed etc


Now I started using alco-tec. They recommend a 5 gallon bucket for brewing. I cannot do that. I need a ratio for a normal juice bottle... 
How much alco- tec to add and sugar. I store the bottle inside a open shopping bag to catch any over flow and wait even 24 hour with the Alco-tec 48hr. I store it in the basement which is dark. 
Anyway, I get a decent tasting bubbly drink. It does get me buzzed. 

My boyfriend doesn't want me drinking and is home all the time do to covid so I cannot even just buy alcohol. UGH...

\- Mash @ 68¬∞c for 60 minutes  
\- Boil for 60 minutes add \[X\] hops at \[?\]   
\- Chill to \~30-35¬∞c   
\- Pressure ferment at \~35¬∞c and add dryhops at high kreusen. Total

"Is the only difference between taprite primary/secondary regulators the fittings? I have a Taprite 740 (""primary"") and a Taprite 1660 (""secondary"").

The 1660 accepts a bracket so that it can be wall mounted, but otherwise the bodies look very similar.

If I attach the ""secondary"" to the ""primary"" with a RHT to LHT nipple, is that essentially the same thing as building a primary? Can it safely handle the pressure coming out of the cylinder, or does it actually need a first stage regulator to be safe?

"Milk Stout Off Flavour x 3 Hello all. This is driving me a crazy. My stouts and other darker beers used to be the only thing that turned out before I got into water chemistry and fine-tuned some of my other processes. For some reason, I keep getting a rubbery-like aroma in my milk stouts. The taste is a little alcoholic as well but this was just a sample. This is the third time I've tried brewing a milk stout and I get this aroma and flavour. 

A little bit of history.. My ""light"" beers like cream ales never turned out well, until I started using lactic acid for ph and campden tablets to remove the chlorine. I started pressure fermenting recently (maybe 6 batches in) and I love it! Had ambers and IPAs and cream ales all turn out, but the first milk stout turned out like my batches before adjusting my water and pressure fermenting.

Some thought the come to mind:

1. Maybe the lactose is messing things up, but i thought it would be pretty straightforward to use. I used 1/2 lb at the end of the boil of a 5g batch. Maybe I am missing something? Should I use lactose at a different time?

2. Ph too low? Maybe all of the roasted malts are lowering the ph of my mash too much? I don't feel like this is the off flavour they would contribute too. I don't take a ph reading either, but probably should

3. Maybe I forgot to use campden tablets for the sparge water? I know I used it for the mash water.

4. Maybe a bit of an underpitch. I used wlp002 and made a 2L starter but saved some for a future brew. Didn't seem very actice, but pitched it anyway

"Bottle bombs and how to stop them. \[copied from r/BrewingNewbies\]

First off, what is a bottle bomb? Well, to keep it short, it's when the co2 levels are too high for the container to handle, and in turn, it explodes.

Now how do we stop our bottles from turning into a war missile? It's actually pretty simple (which means it pretty overlooked).

**1) Your yeast is not done!!!**

If you have any amount of sugar in the container your storing your brew and there's yeast still left alive, then it's going to eat the leftover sugar and continue to make alcohol and also co2 (that's the stuff that makes your bottles go boom üí•).

**2) Basic thermodynamics**

Co2 and everything else in the universe obeys the laws of physics. As the temperature rises so does pressure, making it even more important to not keep your brews in a hot place.

**3) Your airlock is fucked man**

Enough said. If you don't have or can't get an airlock your probably WAY too young to be even brewing in the first place.

**4)** **Contamination**

Wild yeast and bacteria eat and ferment certain sugars that brewers yeast can't. If your brew does become contaminated then it can lead to over-carbonation.

**5) USE. THE RIGHT. BOTTLES.**

I have done some googling it seems the sediment doesn't shouldn't affect the flavour but the colour is very off-putting. I have seen stuff about the new-England IPA's looking like orange juice but this doesnt appeal to me. Have I ruined the appearance of the beer? 

Or will the sediment settle to the bottom of the bottles? Will any movement, reposition or agitation of the bottles kick up the sediment again, for example travelling in a car, or lying them flat in the fridge. Will the sediment ever aggregate and stick to the bottom? I ask because I don't want to give it to friends or family the way it currently looks.

"2.5 Gallon Setup Questions Hi All,


My dad gave me all of his brewing equipment from 20+ years ago, brewed my first batch with an extract kit and made drinkable beer. I really enjoyed the brewing process and it was cool to make drinkable beer, even after a few mishaps. I'm not looking to upgrade piecemeal so much as build a new setup.

Anyway, I want to do all grain and 2.5 gallon batches, this has led to me to the Anvil Foundry 6.5 (with pump kit). I really like the idea of the e-BIAB option both for space savings and because my gf asked that I not brew in the kitchen :)  So, a couple of questions:

1. I'm looking at the Anvil 4g bucket fermenter, is this a good option? I also see that people ferment in kegs, is this viable or preferred for 2.5 gallon batches? 

2. I hated bottling and want to keg. I'm seeing 2.5g and 3g kegs, should I go with 2.5g or do I need extra space like I would in a fermenter? 

3. I'd prefer not to buy a mini-fridge at this point as I'm in a rental house that has two full size refrigerators. We don't have anything in the spare fridge other than beer anyway, can I just put the kegs and CO2 tank in the fridge and serve from there with a picnic tap? 

4. I really like sours and will brew my own. I've read mixed things about kettle souring and sharing equipment with non-sour beers. Is it safe to use the same kettle for both? I would probably dedicate one keg and one fermenter to sours as I'll likely always have one on hand.

"Question about adding malt late in the boil Sunday I brewed an imperial stout. I was doing a partial boil with an extract kit. I encountered a few issues and I‚Äôm wondering if I should have done anything differently.

The recipe called for adding 6 lbs LME and 2 lbs of DME with 10 minutes left in the boil. I‚Äôve never done a recipe that called for adding malt that late. Adding this much cool malt stopped the boil for about five minutes while the pot got back up to temp. As it returned to a boil the pot came close to boiling over and I had to remove it from the burner a few times before the foam settled. My timer went off while I was still working on getting the hot break to settle. I didn‚Äôt want to start cooling the wort while the hot break was still going on so I left it on the burner until it settled. I think it was about 10 minutes. After I cooled it in an ice bath I noticed a lot more stuff floating in the wort than usual. I wasn't sure if it was proteins or scorched malt from adding it too fast or bits of grain that got out of the grain bag. I decided to pour the chilled wort through a grain bag into the fermenter to filter out the solids. I'm not sure how all this is going to affect the beer. Any feedback would be appreciated.

What was the point of adding the malt so late in the boil?

Is the extra time on the burner going to be noticeable? I I figured some extra bitterness from boiling the hops longer wouldn‚Äôt be too noticeable in such a big beer.

"Why does wine turn into vinegar? (Answer) [copied from r/BrewingNewbies]

Most people know that vinegar is made from wine, but what makes wine into vinegar in the first place? Well, there are two answers, a long one, and a short one. The short answer is adding additional oxygen after the first week. The long answer is because of a bacteria called Acetobacter. It produces something called acetic acid, it basically makes vinegar, vinegar. Acetobacter uses alcohol and oxygen to produce acetic acid. That's why it's important to not put in any oxygen after the first week, maybe even sooner.
Now how can you prevent that? Well, you can use chemicals like Campden Tablets, Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite. But if you're like me and don't want to use added chemicals then there are a few steps you can take to make sure Acetobacter doesn't have the time or resources to turn your wine into vinegar. First fermenting, as I said above you should never add in more oxygen after the first week, you can keep it out by using an airlock, or by using a siphoning tube when racking or bottling. Second, you can sanitize everything before use. Yes, Acetobacter is on anything and everything but sanitizing will make it so there isn't as much of it when you're brewing. Lastly, you can pasteurize OR cold crash your brew when it's done fermenting (note: this only works if the Acetobacter hasn't already turned your wine into vinegar) this will help kill anything left alive if you're planning on leaving it in long turn storage.
I hope this helped clear up some confusion because I know some people want to hear details and explanations and not just ""don't put in oxygen"".",Homebrewing

10 lbs Pale Malt

1 lb Crystal 15

.5 oz Columbus (16.2%) 60 minutes

.5 oz Columbus (16.2%) 5 minutes

1 oz Columbus whirlpool

US-05 American Ale yeast

I used RO water and mashed in with 5 gallons. I adjusted with 10g of gypsum, 1.5 g Calcium Chloride, and 2.5 g baking soda.  I did not adjust the sparge water since I batch sparge, although I might start doing this as an experiment.

Measured OG was 1.047 and I put 6 gal into the fermenter because I ended up with not as much evaporation as I expected.  I used [this hop spider](https://www.morebeer.com/products/hop-spider.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaVbo-Ui5m9228mVQma97erRMqrR4rgYsSNFU3byEecR0F3i-nRqiJMaAm3KEALw_wcB) from Morebeer for the hop additions, and a nylon mesh bag for the whirlpool.  According to Beersmith it should be 45 IBUs, but the sample I took did not seem to be super hoppy so maybe the hop spider had some negative effect on the hop utilization.  

I'll need to make a call on dry hopping tomorrow I guess.  I ferment in a Speidel so no pressure transfer for me, but I normally put it into a CO2 purged keg by draining it through the ""Out"" post of the keg.  I might try some sodium metabisulfite to further prevent oxidation.

Currently it's at about 9 psi.  Should I leave it at that, or change it?  Any other suggestions?

"Corny lid on the underside of a sanke? Alright this might seem like a wild idea but, I remember seeing a guy take a half barrel g style coupler (I think that's what it's called) and cut out the coupler and grind open the top for a corny keg lid and he also added a gas in and liquid out.

"Homebrewing During Lockdown is a Blessing I just wanted to take a moment to mention to anyone who may be on the fence or has not picked up the hobby for a while, or maybe those who just want to agree, that homebrewing is an excellent outlet for your own sanity during the lockdowns due to COVID19 that some of us are currently enduring.

I have started all within the last month some Elderberry Wine, some Cran-Apple-Jack, some HARD Apple Cider, and soon I will be sourcing some local honey from a local apiary to start brewing some Meade.

Although I do not have the ability to stay home due to the necessity of my position within a very necessary industry coming home at the end of the day to check on how my various ferments are coming along, developing new recipes, and experimenting are all really appreciated.

So if you have ever considered brewing your own stuff, I would say now is a very good time to start.  You can come out of this with a real skill and the personal enjoyment and satisfaction of reaping the spoils of your hard work and effort over a given period of time.  What's better yet is the ability to directly share that with people around you and that you love and care for.

"First world fermentation problems Since covid, I've been working from home in our spare room where I normally just keep my brew stuff and my fermentation chamber. After a brew I set it up in the fermentation chamber with a blowoff tube into a growler with sanitizer.

"Help me streamline my process and get back into this hobby Hello all, I've been homebrewing for years but recently I sunk into a rut and haven't brewed since May.   Throughout my entire process I've been brewing on a budget with a focus on perfecting my process before investing real money into my home brewery.  I've also been locked into apartment brewing since the beginning and still am, which provides its own set of challenges.

My current set up is as follows: Igloo beverage cooler mash tun (batch sparge), regular ol' brewing pot that I boil on a stove, kitchen sink ice baths, two buckets pouring back and forth to aerate, Speidel fermenter that I have rigged for closed transfers (no true temp control), makeshift keezer with two 2.5 gallon kegs and picnic taps.

Brew days take me a long time and they have slowly become more of a chore vs enjoyable.  Anyway, point of this:  I'm looking for some insight into system upgrades that will streamline my process and bring me back to brewing?  I'd like to decrease my overall equipment so there's less to clean.

I've been looking into an electric All in One system as I feel this will make brew days a ton easier.  Plus that decreases the amount of equipment I have to clean (see ya later mash tun).  Thoughts?  Any any other tips for streamlining the brewing process without sacrificing quality for small scale, apartment brewing?  It'll be some time before I can dedicate a specific area to my brew space, as nice as that would be.

fyi, some things that are needed and will be purchased soon: dedicated fermentation temperature to dial in and maintain ferm temps, outfitting my keezer with true taps/lines and ditching the picnic taps (pretty sure picnic taps are leading to quicker staling of my beer).

I want to make a 5-gallon batch of \*super dry\* cider that is around 6.5% - 7.5% ABV. I also want to dry hop it for some added bitterness and to cut the apple-juice flavor down some.

"To upgrade or to overhaul Here's my current rig: 10 gallon SS BrewTech kettle, the brew bag, 1800w induction burner, hotrod heatstick for extra power during boil, Jaded mantis chiller, Brewjacket immersion. 

I do 3.5-5 gallon BIAB batches. I live in 700 square foot New York apartment with an 11 month old taking up increasing space and attention, so efficiency in all aspects of my brewery is key. What I am trying to decide is whether to add pieces to my current system, or get a completely different system. Here's how I see those options right now:

**UPGRADE CURRENT SYSTEM**

My first thought is to add some kind of grain basket that can hang on top of the kettle when draining. I'm getting tired of having to hold the bag while it drains, and a ratchet to hold the bag isn't an option for me because of brewing location. 

Also considering adding a pump. Mash recirculation would be nice, but main benefits for me would be decreasing chilling times and the ability to do a real whirlpool so I'm not getting as much trub in the fermenter (I know this has no impact on beer quality, but I just want less in so I get more finished beer at the end lol). Would also like to be able to pump the wort into the fermenter instead of needing to use gravity (this would let me change where in the apartment I brew). 

Would also add something like the blichmann brewvision thermometer so I could monitor strike and mash temp on my phone and not need to check the kettle so often before the boil.

Any other thoughts on upgrades I could do to make things easier?

**JUST BUY A NEW SYSTEM**

The obvious choices here are either the Grainfather or Robobrew. Either one would essentially take all the different components I already have or would add in the upgrade scenario, but shrink the amount of space required to store them all. The Grainfather's bluetooth capabilities would be a huge plus for me. Step mashing would also be awesome since I don't do this right now for fear of scorching the bag. An all in one system would let me automate a lot of parts of the brewday that I can't automate right now - this is probably the biggest selling point for me since the kid has made brewdays trickier to pull of with my current set up.

**DRAWBACKS**

The upgrades would add more stuff for me to store, and space for my gear is already at a premium. 

My biggest concerns about the all in one systems are that there is a lot more stuff to break, and that if something breaks, the whole system could become unusable. Right now if one of my components breaks, I can just replace it and still use all the other equipment.

**So what's the verdict? What would you do in my situation?**",Homebrewing
"Programming a Home Brewing System Hello fellow Brewers!

I‚Äôve been looking into setting up my brew system to be controlled via a Raspberry Pi programmable computer. I have some coding experience, though not in Python, my father who I brew with used to work in programming controls for industrial automation in the chemical industry. I also see a lot of helpful resources online to walk you through the set up. In particular, I‚Äôve been looking at the resources available though [CraftBeerPi](http://web.craftbeerpi.com/). I think it would be particularly useful with kettle souring or other brews that require more careful monitoring. We also have a grainfather that might be able to be integrated somehow since it already utilized temp controls. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has attempted this and can share their experience. Besides the Raspberry Pi and the standard brewing equipment I assume I will need some solenoids and pumps but beyond that I‚Äôm a bit lost.

"My first batch ever is on it's way! Finally after lots of lurking in this sub and asking for advice I started my first batch ever.

It was supposed to become an all grain Pilsen but after the first struggles of an surprisingly big cooking pot and a ""not so perfect instruction"" it will be probably more like a chaos speedy strong.

It is based on a 100% Pilsen malt with a 6.5% bitter hops.

In the beginning i was very much struggling with the pot size that was easily 3 times the size of the biggest heating field my kitchen had to offer.

Instead of the expected resting temperatures every rest started out too hot before the temperature cooles down and I started the timer. Every Single rest was about 10 degrees higher than expected except for the last one when i finly managed to understand when to stop the heat and anticipate how much it continues to rise the temperature after.

I succeded the iodine test and was happy. I had the expected  wort strength in my mash and was ready to remove the grain. So far so good but that is where the plan completely disappeared.

I started out with 16 L of mash, recipe said i should add additional 12 L. But I did only 5 as my wort got incredibly watery and dropped down to 6¬∞ Plato instead of the 11,5 needed.

What to do I thought to myself. I don't want a weak watery beer. So I started to boil the hell out of the wort to get the percentage up again before adding the hops. I got back on track but way less wort than needed. After a reduced hops time (i only had about 2/3 to half of the quantity i should have for the 41gramm of Pellets) the wort was back up sky rocketing to 17¬∞ Plato...

At this point i wasnt happy, i was tired from already 8 hours of cooking. I was disappointed by the momentary Situation and in an mood that I just wanted to finish. To the at this point only 12 L i threw in the remaining of my yeast. If it is already stronger than usual i thought by myself that it can also accept almost double the yeast.

I filled it all into the plastic fermenter and to my even bigger disappointment it was leaking. I didn't saw a crack so It hat to be the valve. I checked it and started to juggle my future beer from one freshly sanitized pot to another to find out if the leak got less until I realised that whoever put the valve on the pot put the seal on the wrong side. I started to get angry that this small problem caused me additional loss of time. At this point i was only 5 hours away from waking up to my next work day but I changed it, sanitized everything again aaaand the bucket was still leaking. Much less but still enough... I couldn't take it any longer. I put the fermenter into the tub and could ignore the leak for the night. I needed some sleep.

Next day the leak was magically closed. The bubbler bubbeled fabolous and my hope was high again. Only 3 days later (today) there are only 6¬∞Plato left. Supposedly it should take 2 weeks if I believe the recipe to be left with only 1/3 of the original strength.

First taste test is already promising. It's flavour full, a bit un harmonic still but not too bitter and I like the taste of the hops. Maybe tomorrow or the day after I plan to fill it up into bottles for the last carbonisation. (it already has some, but I want more)

Thanks for reading about my Chaos speedy strong Pilsener

Until now the foam that forms when pouring into the measuring cylinder falls down within a second. But maybe that will get better if the carbonisation is stronger.

My dad and I are going to be brewing this coming weekend, and I chose to try and replicate a beer my girlfriend and I had a few years ago in Florida. I'm wanting to try and make a beer inspired by their Breakfast Club Blueberry Pancake Brown Ale... I'm curious as to what gives the best Blueberry flavor. Adding blueberries to the wort, or I was told to add them to the the keg post fermentation. I've never done anything with fruit or back sweetening before. I'm personally leaning towards the post fermentation approach, because I'm afraid that the blueberry notes are going to change dramatically during fermentation. I'm just wanting to see what anyone has to say about that from their experience. I'm aware that the fermentation process should be completely done before back sweetening. Probably going to attempt cold crashing as well. I would love to know everyone has learned from their experiences.",Homebrewing

"How would you describe the ester flavors of A62 Bell's House Yeast? Bell's mentions that you can ferment their house yeast warm and let the esters open up a bit but they only say it has a 'nice ester profile', which isn't very descriptive.  I personally have a tough time as well putting a finger on it based on a few batches with hop forward beers.  Had a BJCP certified buddy taste a Centennial Blonde with A62 he got some pepper and earthy ester notes but may have been more hop driven.  Any other thoughts?  Bell's beer is not available in Canada so it's kinda tough to compare to the commercial versions.  In any case, I'm glad I had a chance to get a yeast sample as any homebrew'd beer with A62 turns out great.

It luckily went on sale right when I decided to purchase it, so yay. Anyway, for those of you thinking about getting it, I wanted to put it a little report (and another one when I get a second keg).

The first thing I did was take out all of the shelves whatnot. One keg fits fine without any further messing around, but I want 2, so I proceeded to remove the plastic molding on the inside of the door to get more space. Unfortunately, it was all glued on, so I pulled off the gasket around the door (which just fits into a grove that goes around the edge of the door) and started to pry off the plastic. It wasn't too hard, but it wasn't a very clean job. the plastic was thin, so I ended up pulling it off in pieces until it was all off (it's verymuch like the annoying plastic packaging that lots of stuff comes in that is always obnoxious to open). I broke off the protrusions in the insulation afterwards so the inside of the door was flat. The gasket now doesn't fit well since the groove it fits in was part of the plastic I ripped off, but some glue or double-sided tape should be enough to put it back on. I'm going to drill a hole in the door and mount a faucet there. There is plenty of room above the kegs for disconnects, tubing, etc... and thermostat is high enough it won't need to be removed to make room for 2 kegs. 

I can't say for certain if 2 kegs would fit since I only have one, but I did trace my keg and cut a cardboard circle out to get an idea. It looks like it would *barely* fit 2 after the alterations I made. I'm going to get another keg and chance it. I'll use the second keg regardless of if they both fit or not.

I'll check back in when I get a 2nd keg and can confirm they both fit.",Homebrewing
"Can I brew cooking wine from a kit? Hi /r/ homebrewing!

I've been brewing beer for a little over five years. I take the process very seriously, spending time on perfecting recipes, using proper equipment and sanitizing. Throughout that time I've also used cider kits to make something else than beer every now and then. And while the results are less than perfect, some of the cider kits have turned out plenty drinkable and have been a hit at severals parties.

One thing I have never considered trying to brew is wine, as I don't think the results will be very good. I've seen my local brewing store sells kits for wine alongside the cider kits, but I am skeptical. However, I live in Europe and my country has very strict alocohol laws, meaning wine is very expensive. As such, there is no such thing as buying ""cheap cooking wine"", as even the worst quality wine you can find will have the same alcohol fees as an expensive wine (the alcohol fee is flat per ABV). There also is no such thing as cooking wine with salt added as I have heard countries like the US has. The cheapest bottles I can find are around $12 at the moment, and if I want something I can also enjoy a glass of I will need to pay at least $15. This effectively means cooking dishes with some wine in them, like pasta bolognese, or onion soup, are some of the more expensive dishes I make - which I find a bit silly.

Then it dawned on me, why don't I just brew some cheap wine from Red Wine Kit? The quality probably won't be great, but it should be decent enough for cooking. I figure one batch should last me at least a year or two if I only use it for cooking as well. From my understanding, one of the more important things about cooking wine is that it should be as dry as possible - and according to the wine kits I've seen in the store, they end below 1.000FG unless you specifically kill the yeast before it finishes. So if I just let the yeast finish out, the results should be really dry and hopefully tasty enough.

Now. I am posting here for general tips and a few specific questions. Does anyone here have experience with using such ""cheap"" red wine kits? How are the results? Any tips for adjusting the process if the end goal is cooking wine? Any tips for what grape to go for? I doubt mye home brewing store has great selection, but I saw they had a Rioja one - and I usually enjoy Rioja when talking about proper wines.

My main question is about bottling. I don't have wine bottles and would prefer not to buy any new gear for this experiment. Would bottling wine on longnecks work with normal caps? Wine bottles usually have corks, which breathe. However, screw tops, which seem to be getting more common on wine bottles, don't breate I believe. I would guess a long neck with a normal crown cap would work just fine. I have some 0.33L bottles standing around, and that amount would also be quite perfect for cooking I believe, as I usually use a little over third of a normal wine bottle.",Homebrewing

"Acetaldehyde, infection, or PH? My dad and I recently tried making our first braggot. It was kind of a ""what do we have in the cupboards"" type moment so the recipe isn't perfect. We tried to go for a stout-like profile

Heres the recipe:
1. Safale us-05 
2. 1 lb Chocolate malt
3. 5 lb Honey
4. 1 lb flaked oats
5. 3.3. lb Liquid Malt Extract (Dark)
6. 1.5 oz cacao nibs

The grains were steeped in 2 gal of water at 156¬∞ F for 30 minutes, then the Liquid malt extract was added and boiled, at 60 minutes 0.5 oz of cacao nibs were added. 

The honey was dissolved in 3 gal of distilled room temperature water. Then the cooled wort was added to the must. To bring the whole thing up to 5 gals. 

Before pitching the yeast this tasted amazing, and felt very promising! Low acidity, very malty and a great mouth feel. 

Fermenation was very active and formed a very nice krausen. The braggot was left to ferment for roughly 2 weeks then my dad got impatient and racked it into a carboy. It sat in the carboy, reformed a new krausen and continued with a healthy fermentation for another 2 weeks. 

There were no off smells, or pellicles at any point of the fermentation.

We just got done racking into a corny keg, and took a small sample. It was incredibly tart, almost fruity in my opinion. Kind of similar to over-boiled / scorched coffee. 

Any ideas of what went wrong? And what are some possible solutions? Could it be acetaldehyde?

Tldr; made a stout-braggot and it turned out very sour. Almost positive no lacto or wild bacteria was introduced. The wort/must wasn't acidic to begin with. Tastes like burned coffee, how fix?",Homebrewing

In theory, it seems like a better solution to cramming a floating tube onto a short liquid diptube.  At least:

* easier to swap between regular and floating tubes (I don't disassemble kegs often)
* I need only one per keg in service, instead of committing the diptube to the whole fermentation-and-service cycle (assuming I'm willing to open the keg)
* friendlier towards my sanitizing technique: small amount of sanitizer (or more of boiling water) and shaking and rolling.  can sanitize the lid separately and swap out.  (I assume can't use CO2 to push [enough of] the sanitizer out, but that seems to be equally bad with all ""trubless"" dip tubes)

My main concern is if the lid seals: I have a bunch of ""unjerked"" bought-new kegs, so I'm assuming the lid will seal on those.  My secondary concern is if the solution is good only on paper, and not so nice when you actually use it.

The slightest sideways pressure (or weight hanging off it) on the disconnect causes a major leak.

"Is My Fermentation Done For? So I brewed a fairly large 5 gallon biab stput last week. The OG came out to 1.106 I believe, I added 2 lbs sugar during fermentation. Before the sugar I belive it was around 1.092 or something, forgot to write that down. 

My question is did I kill my fermentation. The scenario was I brewed Monday morning and didn't have a lot of time so I didn't pitch my yeast until that night. I got antsy and jumped the gun with my sugar and ended up boiling it cooling it and pitching it into my fermentation Wednesday morning. 

It fermented strong for a few days now Sunday evening I took a gravity reading and im getting a reading of 1.050. My end goal is 1.017. With all the added simple sugar will my yeasties go back to the maltose? Is there a way to referment this beer? Pitch another starter?

"Blackberry tart cherry mead So I decided that I needed more mead in my life, because I hadn't made any recently.  Looking through what I had ingredient wise, I found a blackberry port kit I got a few years ago and never made.  So I figured might as well make some mead from it.  I went to go and check my honey supply, and found out that the bucket I had crystalized all 2 gallons.  Back in the summer, I saw tart cherry juice at Costco, so I grabbed 4 boxes, or 7 L of the stuff.  So I hatched my plan.  I read how to liquify honey, and that I should never get it over 140 F.

"Question about Crystal Malts Just as a thought experiment, I was tring to figure out the effect of substituting different crystal malts, and the effects on the color and flavour profile of a beer. Either when matching existing recipes, or building recipes of your own, how do you pick which Crystal malt to use?

For example, consider a recipe calls for 5% of the grain bill to be Crystal 60L. If you only had Crystal 30L on hand, would it be approximately equivalent to use 10% Crystal 30L instead (twice the amount, half the Lovibond)? Or 2.5% Crystal 120L (twice the Lovibond, half the amount)?

My gut tells me that once you get up to the higher Lovibond numbers, you'll start picking out some more toasty, nutty flavours that weren't present in the lower Lovibond Crystal malts. Perhaps the Crystal 120 was a bit of an extreme example where the equivalency falls apart somewhat. 

But at least for the low-mid range crystal malts (say 15L to 60L), can they all be interchanged with each other as long as one considers the proportion being used? If I only had some Crystal 30L in my inventory, could it be equivalently substituted in place of another Crystal malt in a given recipe by just using proportionately more/less? What differences would I expect from making those substitutions, all other things being equal (same mash profile, base malt, etc)?",Homebrewing

"Clove Phenolic in a Lager I have a lager sample in my yeast bank that consistently produces mild clove notes and I thought someone in this reddit would have some insight. 

This spring I pitched dried 34/70 lager yeast into high-gravity wort to make a Maibock at 10% ABV. The beer was clear of any yeast-derived off-flavors. I then used that yeast cake to produce a light lager at under 5% gravity. The light lager was over-carbonated but tasted pleasantly of cloves to everyone who tried it. 

I top-harvested the yeast from the light lager at high-krausen and stored it. I have used the yeast to create 3L starters (stepping up twice from 30ml) and brewed three 5 gallon batches, each having the same clove note.

Experienced tasters and brewers have tasted my beers and I have not had a significant, notable contaminant in my brews in years. I have hundreds of batches of experience. So I believe my sanitation to be reliable and consistent. 

In short, I have a yeast sample that consistently produces phenolic compounds that are indistinguishable from that in Hefeweizen. 

Has the lager yeast mutated to become phenolic, or is there some other microbe contaminating the sample that is pleasantly phenolic? Does a phenolic lager deserve to exist? Is it special and worth preserving or am I just confusing an undesirable off-flavor from some known contaminant with a totally separate ale separate style.",Homebrewing
"Advice on re-fermenting to reduce sulfur (cider) Hi all! I have about 4 gallons of a test fermentation of crab apple cider sitting in keg. It has a powerful sulfur stink but tastes great. It's also a bit too sour for my tastes.


I had planned to blend it down with separately fermented cider for flavour, but now am thinking maybe I should split it into two fermenters, top up with apple juice, add yeast nutrient, and re-ferment. I'm thinking probably K1V1116 or RC212 for yeast. I also have a culture of kveik hornindal, but haven't used it for cider before, and I'm not sure how it'd handle the acid.

Just got done with my very first all-grain BIB. Checked original gravity with a refractometer and it's at 1.035. Target OG is 1.049.

1. Is the difference possibly due to gravity check being done with refractometer rather than a hydrometer?

2. Where did I possibly screw up to come up with such a low OG?

3. Is it guaranteed that the alcohol content will be lacking?",Homebrewing

"Does reducing the pH prior to fermentation reduce the amount of acid produced by the yeast? I've been adding lots of bicarbonate to reduce the tartness of my sugar wash fermentation, and it works decently, but is still a bit acidic for me. I'm starting to wonder if bicarbonate actually causes the yeast to produce *more* organic acids in its efforts to create a healthy environment (the starting pH of my last batch was around 8.2). Could I potentially be better off adding an acid like HCl to get a lower starting pH (around 5), and then adding bases *after* fermentation to reduce acidity?

Also if anyone has any general tips to reduce tartness (perhaps a different yeast strain?) they'd be greatly appreciated. My standard recipe is just 1 gallon DI water, 1 lb dextrose, 4 g Fermaid-O, EC-1118 and various amounts of Sodium/Potassium bicarbonate (aiming for 300 mg/L).

"bottling mixed culture sour beer I'm intending to bottle a mixed fermentation beer that I've had in fermenter for 8 months.

The beer has been sitting on stone fruit for 10 weeks.   
Basically my concern is that, although it's been stable at this gravity for a while, I know sours can sometimes continue to attenuate and if it got down to 1.000 that plus the priming sugar and residual CO2 could cause bottle bombs. I am using the 750 ml champagne style bottles which should be pretty hard to blow up but it still makes me nervous.   
I've read everything I can find on bottle conditioning sours and how gravity points relate to CO2 but I really just want someone to tell me: should I prime like normal and hope for the best? should I use only a little bit or no sugar and hope they will ferment down? if they become bottle bombs will it happen right away or will it take a while because brett? could I open one in 3 weeks and tell if they're going to be a hazard?",Homebrewing

"Duped by Water Report üß™üíß I used tap water for the first time &amp; referenced my local water report for salt/acid additions - the beer is not great, even though fermentation went smoothly.

My water has **4 TIMES** the stated **Mg** &amp; the **Ca** is **\~20ppm** lower than stated. The alkalinity is also well off **(\~20ppm** higher than reported). So all the effort I went to calculating the correct additions was pointless! Who knows what the mash PH really was.

"""Mass"" Production Home Brewing Just wanted to share my methods of brewing large volumes of beer on a medium sized all-grain setup. ""Mass"" being equivalent of 4 corney kegs. Anyway I think it could be useful for anyone looking to double their output without having to buy any new equipment. This method could be used on a single batch setup (to now make 2 batches) or on a 2 batch system (to now make 4).

* You will need to have two heating pots and a mash tun big enough to fit the extra grain 

I have a typical three vessel setup. 14 gal HLT/strike water pot, 14 gal mash tun, 14 gal brew pot. In a typical method you can only get two batches per brew out of this setup (about 12 gallons of finished wort)

Start with the mash as per usual, adjusting for the extra grain and strike water. In my case its usually around 36-40 lbs of grain and 11-13 gallons of water. This is super close to the top of the mash tun but less head space equals less heat loss, haha.

I then heat 14 gallons of sparge water while I mash, then start the transfer of water to mash, wort to boil kettle. Once the boil kettle is full I fill the mash with the rest of the sparge water to the top. Empty the HLT of any water, and continue to drain the rest of the wort into the HLT vessel. (About 10-12 gallons). There will be a small deficit of sparge water around the end, about 4 or 5 gallons, so I continue to sparge with 140 degree tap water. If some of you dont like that then I suppose you could pre heat some extra sparge water and keep it in an extra pot until you get to this point. I however feel this small amount of tap water is a non issue to flavour or quality in any manner.

You now have 1 pot of extra sugary wort and 1 pot of less sugary wort, but now totalling double you usual volume. You can now boil each as per usual, hopping just one pot, (remember to adjust the hops for the total batch volume). Doesnt matter which pot you hop in my experience. I usually just hop the first one to start boiling. 

Once boil is complete I run one pot at a time through the counter flow chiller into my 4 carboys being sure to divide each pot equally. 3 gallons of extra sugary wort into each carboy and then 2.5 gallons of watery wort into each carboy. 

If you dont like the separated boil pots or you want to try 2 different hop profiles from the same mash you can combine the wort using the mash tun or another vessel. If anyone is interested I can show you how I do that as well.

Anyway this is how I double my output. My brew days almost always consist of 4 batches which I usually find ways of making them all different through dry hopping and pot additions while all coming from the same mash. I then have extra for trading for another style with another brewer or a bunch of one beer for an event or ways of experimenting with the effects of different dry hop additions or yeasts on the same wort. 

And if anyone is wondering why I dont get bigger pots, its because:
1.I have already invested in this setup which I had originally planned to make double batches with. 
2. Space is already crammed as it is
3. Boiling that much liquid in one vessel would require major heating. 
4.This way I can heat two smaller amounts at the same time, barely increasing the overall brew day.",Homebrewing

Recently i got even more involved in the process and started using pH strips and brewers friend water calculator to adjust pH. This has caused my efficency to climb 10% points. Thought this might be a intresting point for those strugling with efficency and to show the importance of pH.

This effect was demonstrated on a dark mild single infusion mashed at 64C for 60min (78%) and the current pilsner that got a slightly more complicated mashing protocol since the manufacturers of lutra kveik recomended a protein rest. 52C 15 min, then 62C 30 min and finally 69C for 30min.

Here are the steps I follow to make each batch:

1) Fill brewzilla with some water. The recipe book I follow is for stovetop and doesn't take into account the false bottom of the brewzilla, so I generally have to add much more water to start than the recipe calls for. The amount of water is still less than the total water required for the batch, however.

2) Heat water to strike temp

3) Add grain, lower to mash temp

4) Mash for 60 minutes, stirring every 10. I don't have a mash paddle, so I'm using a large wooden spoon.

5) Lauter for a few minutes

6) Pull out mash, let drain

7) Sparge until the water in the brewzilla hits the target amount for the recipe. The water is not pre-heated, but ""hot"" from the tap

8) Boil for 1 hour, add hops as per schedule

9) Turn off boil, chill with counterflow until temp is between 68-80; usually pitch in low to mid 70s.

I was trying to brew the black lie recipe from mitch Steele's ipa book but grabbed dark LME instead of the black extract it suggested and it ended up turning out great! So rebrewing with slight tweaks and adding maple sugar I got from my cousin who owns a maple farm. 

Anywho, 
10# 4 oz 2 row
5.2 oz cara 15
4.8 white wheat malt

3.3# canister of dark LME

1 oz Warrior at 90
1.5 oz cascade at 20
4.5 oz cascade at 5

8 oz maple sugar added to ferm vessel after cooldown

"Bottling once gravity stabilizes? Usually when I've brewed, I kept my beer in the fermenter for two weeks then bottled, only because that was mentioned in the first tutorials I'd read and that's just what I'd always done.  I have a Tilt, though, and lately have been checking on the gravity of a beer I recently brewed each day.  The beer was brewed on Sunday and about a day ago the gravity hit 1.012 and hasn't budged since then.  So, I'm wondering if there is any reason to not go ahead and bottle?  Some things I've read have said the beer will continue to ""condition"" (although I don't understand exactly what that means, aside from perhaps some flavors continuing to develop) even after fermentation has ended, but my thought is why not just go ahead and let that happen in the bottle instead of the fermenter, and get a head start on letting the beer carbonate?

"For those who hate bottling, but still do it, try 22oz The title pretty much explains the point. My homebrew school in town (yes there is a LHBS that also has as a brewing school next door) strictly uses 22oz bottles when they have their students bottle beer.

The cost for a 24 pack of 12oz bottles is only $1 cheaper on morebeer than a 12 pack of 22oz (not promoting, just using for cost comparison). So for spending $1 more you can almost get the same volume, but you have to cap less, sanitize less, and clean less.

I still have 12oz bottles for any super high abv or if I'm getting to the end of the bottling bucket and I don't think I can fill a 22oz. Or if you sample your beer during the carbonation phase to see if it is finished, you don't need to open a big bottle.",Homebrewing

"40% Brewhouse Efficiency on Brewzilla Hi all,

Just finished brewing what was supposed to be an Imperial Stout. Been brewing for almost 3 years now with relatively good results except for hazy beer. However, this is my fourth brew with the new Brewzilla 3.1.1. On my first brew, efficiency was 52% and then on my second and third I managed to bring this up to 64%. However, today, I had the awfully pathetic 42% brewhouse efficiency that makes me want to either retire or set this device on fire.

I was supposed to end around 1.079 and ended at 1.050. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's still a drinkable 5.5%-ish stout but not what I wanted to brew. Standard 5 gallon brew, with RO water and adjusted chemistry. Ph was fine too. Sparge was fine. No stuck mash or sparge either. Milled most of my grains except for the Chocolate and Black Malt. Also did what other Brewzilla users have suggested which is stir twice during the first half hour of the mash. The only difference for me was that instead of brewing at 67C/152F I brewed at 70C/158F with the intention of increasing the body.

"SMB addition to NEIPA creating sulfur smell - Have I f**ked up? I'm getting a strong smell of sulfur (rotton egg smell) when I open up my beer 7 days after bottling, the following sections is where I feel like I messed up. I'm hoping after a couple more weeks, the strong sulfur smell goes away in the bottle. It hasn't changed the taste of the beer, though there is no proper taste from that initial 7 day bottle taste test, as I'm expecting a flavour to come about after the 3 week mark from bottling.

I decided to brew a roughly 5 gal (22L) NEIPA and after reading so much about Br√ºlosophy's experiments decided to add more SMB powder than was recommended. It was roughly 1g of SMB, where the recommended amount was 0.3g for the size of the batch. This was partly due to not having a scale to measure it to that precise amount, but in hindsight now: I'm thinking when I diluted the powder in a cup of water, I could have just measured out roughly a third of the cup.

In addition to this, I think the step where I added the powder was probably wrong too: I decided to ferment real mango fruit (following the correct freezing and defrosting methods) 7 days after initial pitching of the yeast. Instructions told me to add it the fermenter before bottling, but I'm not sure how much this would have played an effect. Because I was nervous about oxidation, I decided to add that cup of SMB at this phase, which led into another short fermentation with the sugar that was released by the mango. The smell that was released was a strong sulfur smell, which I disregarded because I knew it was because of the SMB.

What I'm hoping to hear is some reassurance that this has happened to someone and that sulfur smell just goes away in the next 2 weeks during that conditioning process. Otherwise will it just smell like that every time someone opens up the bottle? The smell slowly dissipated as I left the drink in a glass as I understand the sulfur is able to reduce as it is exposed to the atmosphere.",Homebrewing

"One Step Cleaner / Oxidation in Keg I ran out of Starsan, so I figured I would try the OneStep for one brew cycle. I have friends that have used only Onestep for years and swear by it. I know its not technically a proper sanitizer and have since re-upped on my Starsan. The fermenter and keg were both cleaned with the OneStep prior to transfer.  I tried to get as much of the pesky residue out of the keg and even tried to rinse some out with tap water. I know there was traces of it, I could see. 

First pour out of the keg, I could see this NEIPA had been oxidized. First time that's happened to me in a couple years.  

I am wondering , is it possible that OneStep had contributed to my NEIPA oxidizing if there was residue in the keg?          Being an oxygen based cleaner - it certainly has crossed my mind... but who knows maybe it was a bad seal on my keg.  I didn't find any clear info on the internet about this yet so I'm asking here.

"Help, OG is Half of Expected Value Hey everyone,

I put [this](https://byo.com/article/the-king-of-stouts/) Old Rasputin clone (5th one down) into  Brewfather yesterday, resulting in [this](https://share.brewfather.app/eHc2uMipTFbOOP) recipe. I brewed it yesterday and had the following problems:
- The recipe called for 6.13 gallons of mash water which should result in a ""mash volume (water + grain)"" of 7.63 gallons according to Brewfather. I poured the grain in then filled it with water and it ended up being 8.5 gallons.
- I have an Ssbrewtech mash tun and used the Vorlouf attachment for 5 minutes, 45 minuted into the mash. I then used the recirculation manifold for the remaining 10 minutes of the mash. I then sparged the remaining 2.56 gallons of water. However, the had grain settled to the bottom so the top was a few gallons of liquid (see [here](https://imgur.com/a/rol5K0G)) and I'm not sure I got anything out of the vorlouf or sparge other than additional water.
- I then transferred to a kettle, but I only ended up with 6 gallons of water instead of the grainfather calculated 6.5 gallons. I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do, but I just topped it up to 6.5 gallons.
- By then end of the 60 minute boil, I had 5.15 gallons of wort instead of the Brewfather calculated 5.69. i had just estimated a boil-off rate of 0.81 gallons per hour, but ended up closer to 1.4 gallons. Is that too much or did I measure something wrong?
- I lost my counterflow wort chiller so I just used my glycol chiller in a Grainfather fermenter. As such I wasn't able to pitch the yeast until this morning.

Anyways, I should have ended up with about 5.4 gallons of wort at 1.098, but only ended up with 5.1 gallons at 1.048. I'm brewing another beer today, what do I need to do differently? My major concern was all the water on top of the grain bed in the mash, but I'm not sure if this is an issue. It could also be the Tilt's calibration, but I'm not sure.

"Purp-ale? Beer-gundy? [Beer Pic](https://i.imgur.com/8fUGQdZ.jpg)

A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/ho61uk/purple_heifer_recipe_tap_handle_and_pour/) reminded me that I've had some [butterfly pea flower tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BTI2AVO/) for a while that I had intended to try in a beer (for no particularly good reason).

I have a nice honey blonde ale recipe that I've made a few times before that seemed like a good base.  Scaled down to a 2.5 gallon batch:

* 5.6% ABV, 22 IBU.
* 1.045 OG (1.051 with honey), 1.008 FG.
* 4lb. 4oz. 2 Row
* 4oz. C15
* 4oz. Honey Malt
* 4oz. Flaked Oats
* 8oz. Honey, added post-fermentation
* 17 IBU Willamette @60min.
* 0.5oz. Willamette @5min.
* US-05
* Yellow Balanced Bru'n Water profile (75 SO4, 60 Cl), pH target 5.30

Single infusion mash at 155 for 60 minutes, mashed a bit high to prevent the late honey addition from drying it out too much.  Fermented at 67F.

Once fermentation was complete, I filled a coffee mug with butterfly pea flower tea (about 20 grams).  I then poured boiling water on it, let it steep for a few minutes, and strained the liquid off.  I did that 3 times, which left ~8oz. of very dark blue tea.  I let it cool to ~100F and then dissolved the [raw honey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L4G2PBJ/) and added the resulting ~16oz. of liquid to the fermenter, which kicked off a secondary fermentation that lasted for a couple days.  My hope was that the fermentation from the honey would also minimize oxygen addition from the tea.

I raised the temp to 70F for a couple more days, then cold crashed and added gelatin (don't want a murky purple beer), and kegged the next day.

The beer doesn't look quite as in-your-face purple as some examples I've seen, but it's a very pleasing reddish-purple (almost crimson?) color.  The tea flavor itself is very mild, it doesn't really come through in the finished beer at all.  To my memory it tastes the same as previous versions without the tea... a nice smooth blonde ale with a subtle (but definitely present) honey flavor and aroma.

There is a slight astringency on the back end... since I didn't use a proper strainer, which I would definitely do if I tried this again, it's possible that I ended up squeezing the leaves when I was trying to separate the liquid (though, since it's not technically a tea, I don't know if you really get much astringency from it).  The honey flavor comes through nicely in the beer though, so a touch of tea-like astringency doesn't actually feel out of place.",Homebrewing

"Haven't brewed with adjuncts in a while... Or how I saved a batch from near loss. I brewed a chocolate orange porter last night and used adjuncts for the first time in a few years (cacao nibs and dry sweet orange peel). My first mistake was brewing in the evening - I am notoriously careless and rush more when I brew at night. My second mistake was adding the cacao nibs and sweet orange peel to the boiling worst sans filter/bag/basket. I should have added them to my hop basket at least but my mistake didn't become apparent until I started recirculating during cool-down. My pump clogged immediately and in that moment I realized my mistake. I let the wort finish chilling and then disconnected my pump (it was loaded with nibs) and tried to drain it into the fermenter using just gravity, but there was also a clog in my ball-valve. Feeling desperate, I sanitized my arm and reached into my chilled wort and unscrewed the back of the valve - nothing. I then realized what I had to do: I sanitized the end of my ball-valve, put my mouth around it, and blew back into the kettle. Beer immediately started flowing and I was able to mostly fill my fermenter... until it clogged again. This time I had my wife hold a (sanitized) strainer basket over the fermenter lip and I lifted the kettle and poured directly through the strainer. The strainer clogged pretty quickly and doused my wife and I with sweet wort. After all was said and done and I still managed to get 2.75 gallons in my fermnter and pitched some Voss Kveik, which started showing signs of fermentation within an hour, and by [12 hours is going strong](http://imgur.com/a/8aSBLE7).

"Wine SG dropping slowly Hi,

To be able to monitor my wines I usually put a hydrometer inside my fermenter.

For a lot of my previous wines, the SG has fallen from for example \~90 to \~10 in 14 days. However, with my current redcurrant wine, it is dropping extremely slowly.

Here's the log:

Oct 28: 90¬∞ Oe (Starting)

Oct 30: 85¬∞ Oe 

Oct 31: 81¬∞ Oe 

Nov 2: 75¬∞ Oe 

Nov 5: 72¬∞ Oe 

Nov 6: 69¬∞ Oe 

Nov 8: 66¬∞ Oe 

Nov 11: 62¬∞ Oe 

Doing a simple regression on these numbers tells me that the fermentation will take over 2 months to complete, which is kind of ridiculous considering the wine is fermenting at \~25¬∞ C (77¬∞ F) ... In my calculation I consider that the fermentation will slow down as the alcohol percentage grows as well - which worries me even more. Is this normal fermentation time? Am I just being impatient? The only other time I've had a fermentation go this slow, it stalled at 50¬∞Oe for two weeks at which point I cleared it and added a bunch of lemon to try and mask the sugary taste (it was *okay...*)",Homebrewing

"Looking for advice on custom eBIAB kettle/basket I'm planning on upgrading my eBIAB setup with a 20 gallon Spike custom kettle with a mesh basket.

For the kettle I know I'll need three TC ports for the drain valve, thermowell, and heating element, but I'm not sure what the best option for recirculation is. Right now I have a whirlpool return through the top of the kettle that works pretty well, and figure I can use something like [this whirlpool arm](https://www.norcalbrewingsolutions.com/store/Tri-Clover-1.5-Inch-Custom-Whirlpool-Arm.html) for both mash recirculation and whirlpooling. However I've seen a lot of configurations with a lower port for the return (just above the drain valve) so I'm wondering: is there any difference just placing the recirculation return lower with just a pickup tube inside?

For the basket I've been eyeing the [BIAB filters from Utah Biodiesel](https://www.utahbiodieselsupply.com/brewingfilters.php#biab). Does anyone have experience with these or something similar?

"Stouts, Gravity, Refractometers, Maths... Help? I recently popped a Fundamental Observation from Bottle Logic, and while I'm not trying to clone it per se, it's in the range of flavor profile and mouthfeel I'd like to learn how to create.  I'd gotten a lot of great advice on here about stouts, but 5 brews later things just weren't connecting, so I saved a little from the bottle, let it go flat, then threw it on my refractometer....and saw it was at 25¬∞!

I did some ""math"" (I played on a refractometer brix conversion calculator till I got it right), and figure if the bottle is 14.1% and the FG was 25¬∞, that means the OG was 40.3¬∞ (according to the brewers friend refractometer calculator with a wort correction of 1)

Ok... so that kind of makes sense, except that going from the refractometer page on brewersfriend to their ABV calculator page and plugging in the gravity numbers given from brix conversions, it's showing a difference of 1.52% ABV .    Let me try to illustrate:  


**On the refractometer page (lines up with what I saw, and the bottle's stated ABV):**   
OG  :: 40.3¬∞  \~  1.181  
FG  :: 25.0¬∞  \~ 1.062  
WCF :: 1.00  
ABV :: 14.1%

**Plugging the gravities into the ABV Calculator Page:**   
OG :: 1.181  
FG  ::  1.062  
ABV :: 15.62%  (and it takes setting the OG to 1.170 to get close to the target ABV of 14.1%)

So all of that laid out, now I've got three questions:    
\------------------

1) What is going on with the varying ABVs between the refractometer and the ABV calculator using standard gravity ?

2) Which Original Gravity do I aim for when designing a grainbill :: the 1.181 or the 1.170?

3) Finally, and this one could be it's own thread, but I'm using Beersmith2 on an old computer to design the grainbill (I know I should update already, but in the meantime...).   My plan was to use my fermentable malts (base and caramel) to achieve the target ABV according to beersmith, then add in all the specialty malts (chocolate, carafe special III, and other low-fermentable malts with minimal actual ABV impact, so I'm ignoring their impact on ABV), and finally, use Carapils to raise the gravity until I hit the target for OG (ignoring how it impacts the ABV since in reality it wont), and then :: Is that design process right?",Homebrewing

"Batch size, dry hopping amount, slightly confusing terminology I‚Äôve always been slightly confused about this, but I‚Äôve never bothered to ask until now. When people refer to batch size that could mean a whole lot of different things such as the amount they end up kegging, or the amount going into the fermenter, or the amount in their kettle post boil. Usually I can scale the recipe to what I have as my equipment to reach the OG / FG. 

However the hops are still confusing to me. For example on a recent episode of Experimental Brewing, Scott Janish mentioned that sapwood cellars likes to whirlpool with about 2 pounds per barrel. What is it exactly? Is it 2 pounds per barrel of wort that ultimately makes it into the fermenter? Or 2 pounds per barrel of the stuff they are actually able to keg? Those could definitely be a lot different depending on hop absorption and losses. Same question applies to dry hop amount. 

I‚Äôve seen quite a few recipes where the batch size is the post boil volume. The person who wrote the recipe could be potentially leaving behind a gallon or more of stuff behind‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt know that.

Immediately the pressure shot up on the regulator hitting 60psi and gas started blowing out the safety valve. So between filling my trousers and shouting to my girlfriend that the loud sound of gas escaping is perfectly fine, I managed to disconnect the gas before the lid blew off the corny keg. So this is just a quick note to all the other newbs out there, *anti*-clockwise (or loosening) is off on a regulator and clockwise (tight) is fully on!",Homebrewing
"Is it ok to bottle my beer already? On October 24th I brewed at 7%-7.5% ABV Nimble Giant-esque IPA. My pre-fermentation refractometer was at 1.065/15.9Birx, and on November 6th I transferred it to secondary with dryhops and a refractometer reading of 1.029/7.8Birx (roughly 7.4 ABV after using a refractometer calculator.)

"Help to make the jump from simple kit to something more advanced Hi,

I brewed kit beers (Coopers cans) about 10 years ago. In the last 6 months I've retraced those steps and brewed a Pilsner, Mexican style lager and my favourite which is a triple hopped IPA. I enjoyed the additional step of dry hopping with pellets after 4 days in the fermentation bin, and now I want to keep up the interest and progress my brewing. My question is, what is the next step in my learning regarding brewing? I've watched a few YouTube videos and it seems like the next step is a massive one and requires lots of expensive equipment?

"Is it possible to predict % of OG that is unfermentables from crystal malts? This is one thing that I‚Äôve always struggled with. When designing a darker beer with crystal malts, I never know what the FG will be. 

I recently brewed a beer with a pound of chocolate malt, quarter pound of C120, and a quarter pound of C60. Using Voss Kveik, I ended up with an attenuation of 60%. It‚Äôs a kveik, these things are typically 80% attenuation or even higher sometimes. But if a sugar isn‚Äôt fermentable, then they won‚Äôt eat it of course. Brewers Friend of course just takes the predicted attenuation and spits out an FG, but that was way false.

"Cold crashing dryhops failing Hi all,

I have a problem I have not been able to find answer anywhere. I have dry hopped loose 2 times on my kegmenter. Both of those times I have left 5+ liters in the kegmenter because it simply won't come out with pressure and diptube. What could be the answer?

Some facts:
-I have cold crashed for 2 days in 2-4C
-in my 16 l batches I get out 8 liters or after that nothing comes out
-I checked the ball locks they were empty
-I checked the diptube nothing in it either
-after 2 days of dry hopping I shaked the kegmenter to get liquid on top of the hops at the top, but nothing still out of the diptube after waiting 20h
-I have kegmenter and diptube that came with the kegmenter pressure set
-when I opened the fermenter last time I got few more liters out with siphon

"New-ish all-grain brewer looking for recipe suggestions (BIAB) I recently brewed my first two batches (5 gal) with a BIAB setup, an amber ale and a cream ale. The cream was my first and had some off flavours, kind of like an old beer aftertaste. I am not sure if this would be oxidation or possibly the fact that there were likely chloramines in the water. The amber will be getting kegged and carbonated later this week but I skipped secondary and added 1/2 campden tablet to the brew water so hopefully it tastes a bit better.

"Sous vide for secondary additions? About to move my vanilla porter to the secondary fermenter.  I've had the vanilla beans (sliced lengthwise and scraped) soaking in bourbon for a week.  I've read that the longer they soak, the better.  Then I remembered the limoncello I made this summer. 

Traditionally, lemon zest is immersed in clear liquor (vodka, everclear) for about 3 weeks. I followed a recipe that shortened that to 3 hours with a sous vide at 135F / 57C.  It turned out incredible. 

So I'm considering doing the same for my vanilla beans in bourbon.  Has anyone tried this or something similar?",Homebrewing
"Irish Car Bomb Stout? So a goal of mine is to make a stout with the flavor of an irish car bomb without having to slam it because it will quickly curdle.

For those (I can't imagine there are many) who don't know what an irish car bomb is, you take a half pint of guinness, and drop in a shot of half jameson and half irish cream. Promptly slam it down.

My home brew idea is to infuse a bottle of jameson for a few weeks with vanilla beans, a few cocoa nibs, and a few espresso beans to get an irish cream flavor going, and then brew a milk stout with lactose for a nice creamy mouth feel, add the infused whiskey to the bottling bucket before priming and bottling.

Question 1... Is this idea feasible or is there a better way anyone would suggest to get the desired flavor?

Question 2... How much whiskey is enough/too much? I figured that in a 5 gallon batch (640 oz), the equivalent of one shot per pint in an actual car bomb would be around 40 oz. That is a LOT of whiskey. So I thought one 750ml bottle would suffice to give a good flavor to the stout and not overdo the alcohol.",Homebrewing

"What two hop combo would you suggest for a dank and tropical Hazy IPA/NEIPA So I‚Äôve made a bunch of NEIPAs and they‚Äôve all been good to decent but I have yet to really nail the flavor I‚Äôm after.

Other notable combos that fell short:
Sabro/Mosaic/Eldorado
Mosaic/Citra
Citra/Galaxy
Mosaic/Citra/Eldorado

"Tweaking a dry stout to make it maltier I have a stout recipe that I have made a few times now that I am satisfied enough with that it has sort of become my go-to stout. It has nice, roasty notes and I am happy with the depth of flavor. But it is also very dry, which is fine, but I prefer my stouts with some malt. I don't want the sweetness of a milk stout -- not in my go-to, anyway -- just something with a pleasant hit of malt, but I am not really sure where to go.

My base malt is Maris Otter, with small additions of flaked barley, chocolate malt, and roasted barley malt, hopped with Fuggle to 40 IBU. I mash around 152¬∞F. I have looked at other recipes, but I like the one I'm using and would prefer to tweak it rather than going whole-hog into another recipe.

The main thing I have tried so far is to simply change the yeast (White London Ale -&gt; Wyeast London Ale III -- so okay, not exactly a dramatic leap). While that did change the flavor profile a bit, it did not have a pronounced impact on malt character. I thought I had also tried a stepped mash or a higher mash temp, but my notes tell me that is not the case.

Some ideas I'm considering:

* Subbing in Munich for part of the Maris Otter
* Adding another character malt
* Decoction mashing (possibly in addition to the Munich)
* Dialing back the hops to something like 20-25 IBU to see if maybe they're masking something

I'm interested in eventually making a doppelbock, so even though decoction is not traditional for stout, I'm kind of looking at it as a reduced-risk way for me to try my hand at it (I guess I won't ruin my stout if I make a newbie mistake). Based on what I have read, though, I'm not convinced that decoction alone will yield much extra malt flavor from my particular grain bill (hence considering doing in addition to adding Munich).

Other character malts I have on hand are Cara Hell, Cara Munich I-III, Cara Aroma, and brown malt -- I'm thinking one of the Caras might help. And of course, I also have flaked oats.",Homebrewing

"Why are we told not to open the fermenter, but when taking samples it's sort of deemed okay? I was thinking about this when taking the final readings for my latest brew. People seem to say that opening the fermenter is a bad idea because it lets in oxygen and that can ruin your beer - especially a NEIPA (more on that below). So why is it ""okay"" to open the fermenter to take a hydrometer sample? 

Personally I will just get it through the airlock, which will still let oxygen in I'm sure because there will be a concentration gradient, but the opening is a lot smaller than removing the entire lid. 

Is it because there will be a ""blanket of CO2""? I would have thought that the CO2 would disappear after opening the fermenter for the first time. If not the second, assuming fermentation is complete?

I also see oxidation fears a lot in relation to NEIPAs. But what makes them more susceptible? Is it because by design they're heavily dry hopped and so as a result you're opening the fermenter a lot, or is it something to do with the haze required or the malts used?",Homebrewing

[This](https://share.brewfather.app/eHc2uMipTFbOOP) is what I currently have in Brewfather.

However, the water calculation in Brewfather is showing a 7.63 gallon mash volume (water + grain) with 6.13 gallons of mash water and only 1.5 gallons for the grain. Furthermore, it's showing a total water bill of 8.64 gallons and I'm not sure where it's getting that because my pre-boil volume is 6.64 gallons. I'm guessing it's getting that from the grain absorbtion, but I'm not sure. The recipe says to add 5.85 gallons of spike water at 165 F to the grains, wait an hour, then sparge up to 6.5 gallons. With a 60 minute boil time and a 0.4 qt/lb grain absorption rate, that would leave just 3.79 gallons for this 5 gallon recipe. So any help putting this recipe into Brewfather would definitely be appreciated. If anyone could also explain what Brewfather means by ""top-up water"" I would appreciate it because I didn't understand their definition.

Also, I have about a 0.3 gallon fermenter loss so I would also like to know how I can scale this recipe. Should I just use 5 gallons for the recipe then 5.3 gallons for the batch?

"Controlling Nottingham Attenuation I recently got back into homebrewing, and I have always been an enthusiastic user of dry yeast.  More specifically, I have always loved Nottingham for it's reliability, consistency, and neutral to slightly fruity profile.  Also, the fact that it ferments nearly the same from the 50s to the low 70s.  I realize that countless people use liquid yeast and get fantastic results.  Personally, I just know I don't have the time or patience to worry about the relative fragility of liquid yeast or the increased cost when compared to dry yeast.

With that out of the way, I have brewed two all-grain beers on an ANVIL Foundry system.  The first beer I brewed was a Scottish Export Ale, which turned out great.  It finished *slightly* drier than I would have liked, but it was within normal range for Notty.  It went from 1.051 to 1.011 in 7 days for 78% attenuation.  So, when I brewed my most recent beer, an Oatmeal Stout, I decided to experiment with higher mash temperatures to reign in the attenuation of Notty.  I realize I could have used Windsor, S-04, or many other Dry English Ale Yeasts that do not naturally attenuate as highly as Nottingham, but still, I was curious.  Also, I do not have the ability/space/budget to do temperature controlled fermentation, unless you count room temperature.  This is another reason Nottingham is so appealing to me.  Also, I had a spare pack in my fridge, and I am cheap to a fault.

I mashed quite high, at about 158-159F.  When all was said and done, I ended up at an SG of 1.051 for the stout.  Nine days later, I kegged the beer and took a FG reading.  Well, for those of you that already know how this story ends, it turns out that higher mash temps do in fact have a significant impact on fermentation, even if the yeast is an aggressive one like Notty.  It took it down to 1.020 at 68F, so only 60% attenuation!  Honestly, I was fine with it.  I was hoping for more like 1.015, but now I know I can control my fermentation with mash temperature and still use my preferred yeast.  In the future when I make this beer again, I will mash at more like 154-155F and see where that gets me.  The good news is the stout is delicious, and it was a fun experiment.  Cheers.",Homebrewing

"SS Brewtech BME Kettle vs Bilchmann G2 vs Others I'm potentially in the market for a new kettle, both to replace my entry level 8 gallon pot and to open up the option of doing 10 gallon batches.

Right now the front runner is the SS Brewtech 20 gallon BME.  However I'm also curious to hear from others with experience in kettles of that size/price to see if there would be reasons to look harder at the Anvil or Bilchmann options (or, reasons -not- to buy the SS Brewtech).

I wouldn't be using the whirlpool port today, but would consider using it in the future and want it to be future proof.  Not a dealbreaker.

"Options for Inexpensive Glycol Cooling Coils? I have a DIY mini-fridge glycol system that works pretty well. I run the glycol solution using discharge tubing wrapped around the outside of the SS fermenters, and it works great. The only downside is that it gets cold in my garage, and it can be hard to keep beers warm (70F+) using a 25W heating pad. Doing kveik at high temps is out of the question currently. In the past I would keep kveik warm using a light bulb, but can't do that with the discharge hose setup, since it covers the fermenter and defeats the purpose of a glycol cooling system if you heat the solution up in the tubing.

So to compensate, I was going to switch out the discharge hose with a more standard in-fermenter cooling coil, so I can use light as a heat source again. The two inexpensive options that I've found are the KegLand Temp Twister or the Anvil Cooling Coil (eliminating Spike and SS on cost grounds). Are there other options out there that I should take a look at?

Of those two, any reason to prefer one over the other? My initial inclination is to grab the Temp Twister, since it's 3/8"" OD and my glycol tubing lines are 3/8"", so it'd be easier to convert.",Homebrewing

Just wanted to quickly recount my most recent experience shopping with [Morebeer.com](https://Morebeer.com).  I ordered some extra grain, a brew kit, and two different strains of yeast.  The order was shipped out quickly, but somehow got lost temporarily by FedEx.  The shipment was finally delivered but about five days later than it was supposed to be.

Quick response time to my email and quick to make it right, even though the delay in shipping was not their fault at all.

"Anvil Foundry Recirc Pump Question Maybe I‚Äôm over thinking this, but I can‚Äôt find answers anywhere.

Recently purchased an Anvil Foundry and am super excited to brew with it! That being said I am a little concerned with the pump aspect of it. The pump can‚Äôt handle boiling liquid, as it‚Äôs plastic, which is fine, but creates more concerns.

When I stop the pump to start the boil, there will be liquid still in the pump and silicon that doesn‚Äôt get recirculated into the kettle... Should I disconnect the pump to pour what remains in the silicon tubing into the kettle? My worry is if I leave it, that‚Äôs a good amount of unboiled wort going into the fermenter, and is that safe?

Additionally, if I‚Äôm using the pump to transfer to fermenter, do I have to sanitize the lines in some way between mash and boil? Which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if I‚Äôve already disconnected the pump to boil.

"Question About Conical's and Dumping yeast So I was just gifted a Spike Brewing 14 gallon Fermenter for my birthday. I am planning on going to 10 gallon batches. I currently have an SS Brewtech 7 gallon conical. I've never once dumped the yeast. When a beer is ready for dry hopping, I just transfer into a corny keg under pressure. I then let it sit there for a couple days, and then cold crash and transfer to the serving keg.

Since I will be doing 10 gallon batches, I would need 4 kegs just to do one batch. The spike fermenter doubles as a brite tank, so I don't have to transfer twice. By question is about dumping the yeast. At least now, by leaving the yeast cake in there, it fills the bottom of the cone so I know I'm getting as much beer as possible. After dumping the yeast, wont some of the beer drop into the cone where the racking arm cant reach, resulting in less beer for packaging? Or will transferring under pressure make this a non issue? Or do I just transfer from the dump valve instead? What do the rest of you do?",Homebrewing

"Can a tap cause less hop flavor? A few weird occurances. I have brewed a Sabro Pale Ale. I used only Sabro in the beer with total IBU of 30. I used Sabro from 2020 and the following recipe:

https://share.brewfather.app/mLwjUw0ixyyHkz

I kegged it through closed transfer from a Ss Brew Tech Bucket (6 gal). It smelled hoppy and fresh as all heaven when kegging and when letting out co2 and o2 of the keg. The taste was also nice, from the hydrometer sample I poured. The hop is a little bland, but still.

Put it into my tap, whose lines were cleaned with pbw(poured from another keg through tap spout) and rinsed with StarSan. 

Now it has been on the regulator for a week and I poured glasses from it this weekend(after 5 days). There is almost no hop flavor, just a faint tropical aroma. It's on 1 bar. It was dryhopped with 100g from a fresh packet of Sabro in the fermenter on day 3 of fermentation.

Now, here is the freaky part. This exact tap had a NEIPA on it previously. A NEIPA Generously hopped with about 300g of Citra, Mosaic and Idaho 7. This NEIPA also came out pretty bland, and after two months were pretty oxidized. And come to think of it, the Pale Ale before that also came out pretty boring at least from what I was expecting.

Now, here is my question, could the tap lines be the reason? The taps are Intertaps with flow control, and as stated, they have been rinsed frequently. It has 2m of 3/16 tubing. The kegs have been rotated, so it is not the same keg that has housed all three beers...

Choices I made:
  * Sprayed Truck Bed spray paint inside the freezer to seal it. I actually had a small leak inside right away (about 1 gallon of beer leaked from a new line), and it held water tight. It‚Äôs worked great.
  *  I decided to go with 2x10‚Äù treated lumber construction so I could do a [shelf](https://imgur.com/gallery/E3ruFKm) for 16oz cans and short bottles, and have enough clearance for kegs and fermenters to rest on the ‚Äústep‚Äù above the freezer motor housing. I was warned about the excess height and how it would make it hard to reach the bottom, and that‚Äôs true even at 6‚Äô2‚Äù. 
  * I really wanted to go the [easy load keezer lid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/f69dr1/easy_load_keezer_with_storage/) route, but my freezer lid is pretty flimsy and I don‚Äôt think can support any real load. So instead I went the ‚Äúimpossible load‚Äù route with a really tall height. :)
  * I used foam board adhesive and HVAC tape to set some rigid 3/4‚Äù [insulation ](https://imgur.com/gallery/2xF6a3l)inside of the wood collar. 
  * Chalkboard paint for the lid.
  * Fan and [dehumidifier ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ynp02fw) additions for airflow and condensation issues. The dehumidifier works great - I think I need to reposition the fan.

Still want to:
  * Get short wooden tap handles
  * Figure out how to redo the fan to circulate air up and down more (current set up is half-assed)
  * Mount CO2 canister outside
  * Purchase an extension arm ‚Äúgrabber‚Äù for things that fall to the bottom of the keezer.

FERMENTATION:

PROCESS NOTES

I did my best to limit oxygen ingress at each step of the process. First dry hop is at the tail end of fermentation, then I did a soft crash to 55 just to drop the hop matter out of solution. After this, I did a semi-closed transfer to a keg with a floating dip tube I use as a ""dry hopping keg"". I do my second charge here, cold crash under pressure, and then closed transfer to the serving keg. Since I moved to using this dry-hopping keg almost like a secondary fermenter I've had minimal hop burn even at high dry hopping rates like this. 

For the competitions, I bottled from the keg into PURGED bottles, filled all the way to the top with essentially no headspace. The ""semi closed"" transfer I mention is siphoning from the fermenter into a completely purged keg via the outpost with a blow-off tube on the in post. I completely purge my kegs by filling them with star san and then pushing it out with CO2. I experimented with pushing the Cl:SO4 ratio here higher than I normally do, in the future I'd drop it back to my normal 170:85 ratio. Otherwise, I was extremely happy with this beer. Going to drop a scoresheet at the bottom of this so you can see what one of the judges said.

"Palmer's ""Fighting Urak Hai"" barleywine OG at 1.6? I have been brewing for two years. Typically at this point I have been doing BIAB successfully, but I wanted to try a barleywine and don't have the capacity to do anything other than extract. So I figured I'd keep it simple and follow the recipe in How To Brew, which calls for 5lbs of malt extract at the beginning, and 7.3lbs at the end. (For a 3 gallon boil).

I ended up with a chilled wort at ONE POINT SIX, targeting 1.01. I didn't notice much boil off, so I'm curious why the OG was so vastly off of what it should have been based on the book.

I was able to dilute it down and I suppose I'm not made because ideally it just means more beer, but does anyone have any thoughts on why the OG was so much higher than expected? Unless I totally misread the recipe...",Homebrewing
"Success Cleaning up Acetaldehyde in Helles by Krausening from a new Lager Like the title says, just want to share a success story bringing a lager back from the brink... I had 2 kegs of Helles pick up unmistakable acetaldehyde (green apple) show up a month after going into lager.  Apparently 4 days @ 63 for D-rest wasn't enough to clean everything up.  Both kegs got it so I think it was the result of incomplete fermentation.

Anyway, I held onto this beer for another month (now 9 weeks after kegging/lagering), brewed up 6 gallons of Czech Pils with the Urquell strain, let it become real active, and drew about 1L of beer for each keg.  I let them rest at 62F, sealed under pressure.  After about 5 days, there was noticeable improvement, but I gave them another 7 days just to be really careful.  Kegs went back into the keezer and now they are on draft.  That was in October, and I'm now enjoying a 3-for-the-price-of-1 light lagers.

I've been sitting on a spruce tip beer/wine for some time and can't seem to get it clear. Heres the details:

Simple recipe, I wanted to see what flavour I could get out of exclusively spruce tips in my homebrewing adventure. It's only spruce tips and sugar boiled in for a half hour and left to cool before pitching yeast. Fermentation began in late June. Finished fermenting down to 0.00 SPG late August. The brew was still very hazy. I transferred from fermenter to carbouy and placed in a cold room (10-13¬∞C) hoping the cold would speed the crashing and make a nice clear wine to bottle but no luck. Its been a full month and I have a small amount of sediment on the bottom of the carbouy and a pretty thick looking brew.

I was able to get the keezer built in about 5 days time over a few weekends - I try to let the urethane dry for nearly a week in between coats and sanding. We had some cold weeks and I didn't want to hit it too early.

Some brief stats and equipment that I used:

* Menards house brand Criterion 9.0 cu foot freezer
* Micromatic 6 Tap Stainless Tap Tower (Air Cooled)
* 4 Independently Regulated CO2 manifold (salvaged from old keezer) w/ a new cheap add on 2 way manifold.
* Samsung Tab S 10.5 Tablet from 2012(?) on an articulating tablet mount running a kiosk browser with [Keg.ninja](https://keg.ninja/) as my tap list and volume tracker.
* 3"" 120v recirculation fan (a huge upgrade from my spliced together cpu fans)
* Inkbird Temp Controller (my last one had the flush mount controller instead of the dongle but the wires running in the keezer were annoying as well as mounting a an electrical box outside)

"No Head For Christmas- XXX So now that I have your attention XXX just stands for none, none, none. 
I brewed my Christmas gift beer 3 weeks ago. Started at 1.095 and finished at 1.020. Fantastic!  About 10 days in I added 6 oz of sterilized Callebaut Cocoa powder slurry. 3 days later I added a coffee cold brew concentrate I made with some extra wort. When I went to add it there was another thick krausen on top and it all the spinning of the carboy in the world wouldn‚Äôt make it sink. 2 days later I added some coffee beans and they wouldn‚Äôt go through the krausen without stirring. 
The issue and point of this story is I grabbed some cocoa powder from the restaurant I work at. The cocoa powder was a high fat content powder. 
I did a mini carbonation test. I poured the beer and the foam started to rise and dissipated in about 3-5 seconds, almost as fast as a soda. Be careful about the accidental addition of fat. The beer will condition for another month. It already tastes good and will be better in December but there will be no head for Christmas.",Homebrewing
"Using brown sugar in a brown ale Hey all...

Getting ready to brew an american brown ale this weekend. I‚Äôve got a recipe I made myself, but I‚Äôm going back and forth on whether to use brown sugar or a caramel/crystal 30L malt. [Here‚Äôs the recipe:](https://share.brewfather.app/QZAMiagp25X84K)

10lb Maria otter (78%)
1lb Carabrown (8%)
.75lb caramel/crystal 60 (6%)
.5lb chocolate malt (4%)
.25lb caramel/crystal 30 (2%)
.25lb wheat red malt (2%)

1oz wilamette 60 min
1oz cascade 15 min

I‚Äôm debating swapping the caramel/crystal 30 for some light or dark brown sugar. One of my favorite browns is Upslope (Boulder, CO) brown and they use brown sugar so that‚Äôs where I got the idea. I‚Äôm shooting for a flavor profile that is sweeter than more bitter, and highlighting toasty/buiscuit malt sweetness over candy/caramel sweetness with a. Good balance of both. I don‚Äôt want to approach Porter territory with an excess toasty flavor and associated bitterness. I have 2 questions:

1) does the addition of brown sugar add candy sweetness to the equation as I would imagine

2) if you‚Äôre on team brown sugar, would you use light or dark brown sugar- or even molasses- in this particular recipe?

I have been brewing on propane for a few years [in my garage](https://i.imgur.com/nw9MLav.jpg) with my biab setup.

I picked up an original grainfather 110v off someone local and [dedicated a corner of my basement to brewing.](https://i.imgur.com/Us7l8iW.jpg) The 110v takes some time to get up to temp/boil, but the jacket definitely helps.  I thought about upgrading to grainfather connect controller but I do like the simplicity and functionality of controlling everything manually, curious about what others think about it.   I'll also be controlling fermentation temp for the first time.  My basement is usually around 62F in the winter so I have a fermwrap+inkbird to bump up the temperature when needed, keeping an eye out for a cheap mini fridge to convert.

"Revelation about ""green beer"" Bear with me here, these are just some thoughts that may or may not be correct, or maybe its common knowledge, but I figured I would share.

I've been wondering for a while what the hell ""green beer"" or ""young beer"" is.  I'm sure everyone can say after tasting a freshly fermented homebrew from the FG sample that there is a ""green flavor"".   Nobody can seem to accurately describe the taste.  Forum discussions say things like ""it goes away as the beer matures"", or ""the beer mellows out with age"", ""its sharp"", ""don't drink the beer young"", ""be patient"".   I've been searching for a long time about **WHY**?  What is chemically happening to the beer after this time?  If you go down the rabbit hole you will see responses that the yeast is cleaning up after itself, to which I ask ""for months?!"".  This is thought process is especially true for lagers, although that brulospher has his quick lager process that I, and others, agree with.

I gave up on finding the answer to this question, until I started going on a lager kick recently after a five year hiatus.  I never really brewed a great lager before.  I have all the right components, fermentation fridge, ability to get good tasting water, understanding of yeast pitch rates.  I messaged a few lager brewers in my area and got an interesting response from one:

""Get your yeast out after Fermentation. Time, filtration, or fining agents will all work.""

Hmmmm.  I decided to brew a two hop, single malt pilsner, 142F mash for 40 mins, 158F for 20.  34/70, two packs.

After the beer finished fermenting, it smelled great and finished to about 1.010.  I lagered for about a week, with finings.  The beer was still a bit hazy, and I transferred it to the keg.  After carbing I found it still hazy and ""green tasting"", and to be honest not very good. I added more finings and waited two days.  Here's where things got crazy.  As the beer clarified over these two days, the remaining ""green taste"" faded away and I was left with a very nice lager when I had a weird tasting beer before.  I repeated this with a Kolsch and Wyeast 2565.

I am now 100% convinced that there is no need for a long lager, and that as long as you can get the yeast out of your beer you can avoid a green taste.  This is especially true if your beer SMELLS delicious.  Yeast don't have a vapor pressure, and aren't going to appear in the smell.  When people say that a beer is green and that it matures, I'm concluding that it most likely means that the yeast flocculated out of the brew and they are no longer tasting them anymore.  If you want to be even more sure that yeast has a flavor, try some drops of yeast from a liquid yeast package.  Its very bitter and terrible tasting, even if it smells great.  Maybe this only applies to lagers, but I was really blown away on how necessary this step was for me.  From my experience its really not cosmetic.  Give it a try if you feel like your beers still have that ""homebrew"" flavor.",Homebrewing
"My 2nd brew During the first lockdown in the UK I started binging Homebrew videos on YouTube and pre-ordered myself a Robobrew 35L. A couple of months later (as I presume everybody else took up home brewing at this time) my dented box arrived but the contents was unharmed. 

For my first brew I did a simple SMASH with Maris Otter and Citra. While that was fermenting I got ‚ÄòHow to Brew‚Äô aka the bible and binged more videos to create my own recipe for my second brew. I noted everything down from my first attempt at all grain brewing and picked up on potential mistakes (I was about 6pts under the target OG, didn‚Äôt sanitise the sieve before pumping out to the fermenting bucket). Today was the day I made the ‚ÄòSand Goby IPA‚Äô (I fish so my beers will be aptly named). 

Recipe:
3.5kg Maris Otter
1kg Munich
0.5kg Caramalt

21L mash water - 72¬∞c strike 65¬∞c mash for 60min to 75¬∞c mash out for 10mins
7L sparge water @75¬∞c

3g each Citra, Mosaic &amp; Simcoe @ 60min boil
6g each @ 15min boil + 1/2 a protofloc
12g each @ 5 min boil
15g each @ 80¬∞c whirlpool for 15mins
20g each for a 3 day dry hop

OG 1.057 - bang on target
19L in the fermenter - 1L under 20L target but I‚Äôd rather be under volume than under OG

Estimated 10 day primary @ ambient room temp and further 10 day secondary

No water treatment other than campden tables as my water is quite hard but fed from chalk streams.

"Question - Guinness Tap Help Hello,

I am looking for some help from all of you who have Guinness on tap in your Keezers and Kegerators. I just built a whole new 8 tap Keezer, which is quite amazing and has been getting lots of use. I use it for many homebrews, a Miller Lite keg, and now the newest addition...Guinness!

The problem for me is every time I pour a pint, I get way too much foam, almost no cascade, and a very sad looking pint.

Stuff you guys should know:

* Keezer temp is 38 degrees
* The beer line is 15'
* The keg was bought 4 days ago, sat in the keezer to acclimate, and then was tapped when I received all the supplies I had ordered. (Yes I picked up the Guinness a little early)
* I am using a 75% Nitrogen 25% CO2 mix
* I tried pouring Pints at 30 PSI, 40 PSI, and 25 PSI with the same effect.

I am kinda stumped at this point. I was hoping for a nice cascading pour and at the 2-minute mark, I have maybe half an inch of beer at the bottom and the rest foam. My primary thought is maybe since the keg sat so long before being tapped it could have messed with the beer's natural CO2 level. But I really have no clue - looking for any kind of help!

Looking forward to hearing from you guys!

3. Do you use electrical tape to attach the fermwrap? It seems like this would be a mess after a couple uses. I use the nylon carry straps sold by vintage shop. Will they melt if I use them to hold it in place?

"High Gravity Brix Correction I brewed the Bleu Reserve recipe from AHA a few weeks ago, about 13# of grain, 2# of candi sugar. The original Brix I got was 10%, which struck me as low given the target OG is 1.071, target FG 1.016, target ABV 7.5%. I thought maybe it would show on the back end of the Brix, maybe the Brix would be extremely low after fermentation. My final Brix was 6.6%, leaving me with 3% ABV. It seems impossible, I normally get 75-80% efficiency. Fermentation seemed healthy, 5+ days of nice airlock activity at 63F.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question: Is there some adjustment to be made for high gravity beers? Was my efficiency just terrible for some reason? The only remarkable thing I remember from the brew is I was about 2L short of expected final wort volume I think due to grain uptake, but I can't imagine it affected my efficiency that badly.

"What does a recipe with a low FG tell you? Hey friends. I've been fumbling around with making my own recipes for a few months now. I've been using the Brewfather app to create these recipes (as well as brew with and track fermentation), and I've been using the included style guides to get close to what it is that I have in mind.

If your not familiar with the app, you can choose a style and the app gives you min and max ranges for things like ABV, color, OG, FG, and IBUs. As you make adjustments to your grain bill, hops, etc. you can watch the effects of your changes and compare them to the selected style and whether or not they fit.

**I've noticed as I play around with this that my estimated final gravities will often be below the recommended levels even though my OG is within the proper range.** I'll then try to increase my grain amounts to get the FG into the proper spot, but then my OG will go way over. Seeing as I can't seem to get my OG and FG into the correct levels *at the same time*, I'm assuming that there is something about their relationship that I don't understand.

Does anyone have any input on what I'm missing? If a beer's final gravity is higher or lower than what's typical of the style, and everything else about the beer is correct, what does that actually do to the flavor?

"Best way to carb? Hey guys, during lockdown I've step up my brewing game and now some of my neighbours are buying my beers.

This is great and very exciting for me, but I cannot keep up with the demand and very often have to tell my neighbours I have no beer.

My brewing space is very limited, but I figured I could ""increase"" my production by carbonating (?) using a CO2 tank instead of using table sugar and having to wait 2 more weeks.

I want to use the money I've raised wisely to step up my ""brewery"". Is getting a kegging setup and a beer gun to bottle a good idea? Or is there an easier/better way to reduce carbonation time? I assume I would need to get another chest freezer since the one I got (fermentation chamber) is (almost) always at full capacity. Either that or buying the Ss Brewtech chilling kit and a cooler with ice to get my fermenters out of the freezer.

Any ideas?

"Imperial stout draft pouring half foam after 4 days in kegerator Hello beer friends!

I recently purchased a 2 faucet Kegco kegerator and am currently working through my second 5.5G keg, however I cannot seem to figure out why I cannot get a consistent pour that's not too foamy. I know this happens a lot to new kegerator owners, and I've tried to look up everything I could online first, but nothing I've tried so far seems to totally fix it... so I've resorted to writing up this post.

The beer I have on tap is the Yeti from Great Divide Brewing, which is a 9.5% imperial stout. I also have a keg of kombucha hooked up to my other faucet. I picked up both of the kegs from the liquor store last week Friday at about 7pm. I had a friend visiting me from out of state that night, so I was excited to tap the keg if I could. I've read mixed opinions on whether or not you NEED to let the keg sit over night before tapping, and from what I could gather the only thing that matters is that it's the right temperature (\~38 deg). Needless to say, I decided to tap the keg when I got it home around 7:30pm. Unfortunately I forgot to turn the CO2 on prior to tapping the keg, but I immediately realized I messed up and untapped the keg, turned the CO2 on to \~8psi and retapped the keg. The kombucha tasted flat, and didn't have the punch/vibrancy you'd normally get via the carbonation. The stout also tasted a bit flat and wasn't as cold as I felt it should be. The stout poured very foamy as well.

I realized it probably just needed some time to carbonate and chill, so I turned the CO2 up to 11psi and let the kegs sit for a day. We had some people over the other night and they wanted to try the beer. When they poured the stout, again, it was quite foamy and told them to let it sit and avoid drinking it for now.

The next day, I put a cup of water on the floor of the kegerator to test the liquid temp. I noticed it was \~43 deg (much too hot). I also put a cup of water on the top of the kegerator to test the line temp, and noticed it was \~48 deg. I turned the kegerator down to \~36 and waited some more and repeated the water tests, and managed to get the floor temp to read 38 deg and the line temp to 40 deg.

About 4 days after initially picking up and tapping the kegs, and the kombucha tastes pretty good now though, but the stout still pours about half a glass or so of foam... The kegerator is set to 38 deg and psi is at 12. What else should I do? Anything that looks off to you?

Happy to answer clarifying questions too. I really don't want to continue to waste this delicious beer via foam as it's definitely not cheap!

My thought is that if I cool to 32 and rack, and then lager at 35, the released CO2 from the warm up will push out any oxygen introduced in the transfer.  My fermenting carboy is 6 gal, the one I will use for lagering is 5 gal, so headspace after transferring will be minimal.

"Newbie Question - When to bottle? Why is a hydrometer better than watching for bubbles to stop? Hi All,  I'm relatively new to making beer and I'm excited to learn as much as I can.  I understand that a hydrometer is useful when making beer because it allows one to estimate the alcohol content.  With regard to determining when it's time to bottle a batch, I've read that a hydrometer is superior to simply watching for bubbles to stop forming in the airlock.  I understand \*how\* a hydrometer is used but I don't understand \*why\* it's superior to waiting for bubbles to stop.  

If the wort is still bubbling, isn't that a sign that it's still fermenting and that it isn't ready to bottle?  Is it possible that the wort would be ready to bottle but would still be bubbling?  Is it possible that the wort would stop bubbling but would not be ready to bottle?  If fermentation was just happening very slowly, so that the bubbles weren't obvious, wouldn't the hydrometer readings also be changing so slowly as to not be noticeable?  For what it's worth, I use StarSan in my airlock, so the bubbles are pretty obvious and they stick around quite a while.  I usually clear them once a day when I check the wort.

My setup makes it a little tricky to sample the wort so I'm trying to determine the relative risks - leave it alone until it stops bubbling but risk bottling at the wrong time or risk contamination by sampling every few days.

"Free range dry hopping Hi guys

I have a question / discussion opener regarding dry hopping, especially so called *free range dry hops*.

Before this point, I have been dry hopping using one of those SS capsules where you stick the hops in after kegging, notice that the center is all dry, there is little to no hop aroma in the beer and you want to slice your wrists with a rusty screw driver.

I recently got a bouncer *mac daddy* filter (the larger one) and decided to try my hand at dry hopping by just throwing the hops into the fermenter at approx. 70 %  attenuation, just letting them ride it out for a few days. 

The kegging experience was a nightmare: I was going for a closed loop transfer where beer entering the keg full of CO2 displaces the gas which in turn flows into my fermenter to account for the amount of beer leaving the conical. It was supposed to be a fully oxygen-free transfer, as previously I have found to work perfectly. I had to empty the bouncer filter about 5 times due to there being so much hop debris that the beer would not flow through. This, in turn, caused me to add 5 loads of air into the keg, as after every emptying of the bouncer, it was full of air. Of course the air also flows through my dip tube into the keg, bubbling perfectly through the beer as it tries to find it's way into the gas post.

In the end, I managed to get about 2/3 of the beer into my keg. The rest was just an infernal mush of hops and beer mixed together. I ended up drinking what I could (in panic) and dumping the rest into the sewer, cursing like a mangy sailor. 

I am hoping for any advice regarding *free range dry hopping*; how do you do it? How do you prevent the hops from getting into your keg? How do you manage to drop the hops out of suspension so you can dump them through the dump valve? Do you have any other methods of dry hopping that are superior to the SS capsule bull shit?

Sorry for any parts hard to understand - English is not my first language.

For curiosity's sake, here's my first free range dry hopped IPA. What I managed to get into the keg, tastes like heaven. 95 % Viking Malt Pale Ale, 5 % Viking Malt Wheat. Citra, Amarillo, Centennial. WLP001.

"First time brewer and I'm a bit lost. What is the best way to bottle with a pressure barrel? (long) I have a kit that has a fermentation bucket (with no tap) for the first 1-2 weeks, which is then syphoned into a pressure barrel with the priming sugar for secondary fermentation/carbonation. The thing is I would like to store it in bottles and 2L kegs (referred to as torps) for the sub by Krups. Unfortunately they don't make reusable torps but you can unofficially reuse them.

1) My question is what is the best way to bottle this beer? After fermentation in the barrel? Or completely avoid the barrel and just do the carbonation in the bottle/keg? I have seen it is tricky to bottle beer after carbonation in the pressure barrel as its difficult to avoid introducing oxygen when pouring it, so the beer won't have a long shelf life and it will lose its carbonation.

2) If I am able to fill these bottle/kegs from after carbonation in the barrel, is there an estimated shelf life? (with everything sanitised of course)

If I cannot or should not carbonate in the barrel, and preferably should just bottle it instead, I have another question.

3) Is it ok to syphon into the barrel and mix with the priming sugar, then immediately bottle/keg it? Will there be any risk of killing the yeast in doing this? Will this introduce oxygen or anything that will affect my beer? I ask this because the first bucket does not have a tap. Filling bottles and torps will be much easier from the barrel.

Alternatively I could just add the priming sugar to each keg/bottle.  I can then either syphon the beer into the barrel and then fill each bottle/keg from the tap, or I can syphon directly into the bottle/keg. Is there any advantages with the latter?

"Best liquor and/or flavors for a hard seltzer? I'm not looking to brew my own alcohol. But I do own a keg and a co2 tank for seltzer.

I'm wondering what is the best type of liquor to use if I want to come close to the hard seltzers on the market?

Right now I'm drinking a twelve ounce drink of 30 psi @ 40 degree tap water. I added some drops of sodastream flavor (this is normally just fine on its own) and 1.5oz smirnoffs vodka. I never drink mixers but wow this is *bad*. Then I added 2 grams of sugar, which i think made the drink go flat along with the uncarbonated 1.5oz shot. It tasted barely better, but still, bad.

b.) maybe i need to try a different brand or type or liquor? I've seen some posts about using rum

"Stale/weird beer smell Hey everyone!

I decided to get back into brewing just over a month ago, and revitalized my Brewzilla in order to make a batch of vanilla cream ale. The brewing went smoothly, and the first bottle was amazing - the vanilla was clearly present on the nose, and it tasted super nice. Unfortunately, it was a little undercarbed, so I left the rest in my closet for another week. Now the bottles are perfectly carbed (lacing looks great), but the quality of the beer itself seems to have degraded a little bit.

"keg pressure fermenting volume Hi. I've been interested in pressure fermentation for awhile. Specifically, fermenting and serving in the same vessel with a floating dip tube.

Just want some anecdotes or wisdom from people with experience. Should I 
1) do a 5 gallon batch and add fermcap?
2) adjust the volume when brewing to end up with 4.5 gallons even though it may change the abv or flavor a bit (does a half a gallon difference change the beer that much?)

I have a bottle filler for my Intertap taps, basically a racking cane and a bung, but it works OK for the small number of bottles I fill with carbonated beer.  I could put all the flat beer in the keg, and immediately use gas to transfer to primed bottles from the tap.  Would enough yeast get in there to actually condition/carbonate?

I could also prime the keg itself, transfer the whole drink, purge the headspace with CO2 and shake it to mix, then transfer some (primed) beer to bottles, and let the keg condition naturally instead of relying on CO2 to do it.

I want to stress test an idea with you. I have limited space for fermenting in my house. The detached garage has not got power and being a rental I don't want to pay for that to be installed so I'm unable to do the standard temp controlled fridge.

A solution that sprang to mind recently is a more polished version of this set up.

https://www.ikegger.com/blogs/ikeggerworld/how-to-temperature-control-your-fermenter-for-under-100

In my adapted version, one of the 4 kegs in my kegerator will always be soda water. The fermenter will be housed in an insulated cupboard sitting next to the kegerator, with a heat source and temp controller installed.

The liquid out line of the soda water keg will be split, one side running to the tap and the other side running through a pump, through a coil in the fermenter and return through an extra post in the lid of the keg. Each line after the split will have a check valve to prevent back pressure. The pump will be powered by temperature controller, flowing cold soda water through the coil and directly chilling the fermenting wort.

"A noob brewer who wants to brew a lower alcohol lager for a jolly nice nurse, and is looking for easy-to-read learning resources Hello chaps,

(TL;DR: I'm new, I can brew with a Cooper's kit, but I want to learn how to lower the alcohol)

Thank you for letting me join your Reddit, it's absolutely fascinating!

I'm very new to brewing (although I'm an old hand at fermenting foods and kombucha) and I've started off with a wildling cider, a plain mead, and 25 litres of Cooper's European Lager.

My fianc√© loves the taste of the Cooper's lager, and he likes a few bottles when he gets a day off work. He is the reason I took up brewing. We live in a semi-rural part of the north of England (think Winterfell in Game of Thrones), we're in lockdown, and there are sometimes shortages of lager in our local supermarket. When my fianc√© gets a day off work the only way to guarantee there's a beer in the fridge for him is to brew it myself (he's working as an NHS nurse and has been treating patients with Covid, so I'm extra keen to do this for him after he's worked so hard).

The trouble is that I think this lager is a lot stronger than the kind we would usually buy, and I'd like to know how to tweak the recipe to lower the alcohol content. It doesn't need to be zero alcohol, I just want to understand what I'm creating with this kit, and how to make it with the minimum possible alcohol content, rather than the maximum possible alcohol content.

Can you recommend some easy to understand (for a noob) articles on the science of brewing in relation to lowering alcohol content? Do I just add less of the hopped malt extract? Or less of the yeast?

Things I have to consider:
‚Ä¢ my fianc√© doesn't like real ale, or anything too hoppy. He likes German lager but will not drink anything more interesting (I will, though!)
‚Ä¢ I can't get any more kit because I've filled the kitchen to capacity
‚Ä¢ any new ingredients need to be easily obtainable via post

Kit I have at home:
‚Ä¢ 25 litre fermenting bin with air lock and tap (x2)
‚Ä¢ 5 litre demijohn with airlock (x4)
‚Ä¢ multimeter in Polish
‚Ä¢ sanitizer, brewing sugar, carbonation drops, Cooper's Brew Enhancer ""Number 2"", yeast nutrient (for the mead)
‚Ä¢ 250ml glass bottles with caps and capper (loads!)
‚Ä¢ a brewing space at a consistent 20 degrees Celsius

What do you think? Is it possible for me to science the sh*t out of this, but to do so with baby steps where I learn as I go along, rather than jumping in at the deep end of all-grain boiling mash hopping hardcore brew-mastery? All advice gratefully received, especially directions to good learning resources.

"Refining my brewnotes spreadsheet.. figured I'd share [https://imgur.com/a/48IpPnd](https://imgur.com/a/48IpPnd)

I love notetaking, but have garbage handwriting and am a bit obsessed with neat notes. None of the online brew note websites or apps have scratched that itch, there's always too many fields left blank or not the right field for the data. So I made a simple one on excel. Was good learning also. 

Alcohol, apparent attenuation, IBUs (even have a utilization function in that one, it's a long formula haha), grain weight and percentages of grain bill are all tied to a formula. The only thing I haven't done yet is the og/fg calculator side of things. Easy to do formula-wise, but you have to either look up and type in the PPG of each grain, OR import a massive list like brewers friend already does.. So I still just use brewers friend. 

I'm considering eventually adding a simplified version of it.. and just having ""pilsner malt"" and then link a general PPG to it regardless of the brand, and just do that for most of the malts I use even somewhat regularly. But that's for another day, when I'm bored at work or something.

2 lbs Barley, Flaked 

1 lbs Black Barley (Stout)

The only differences I perceive is Guinness has a little better head retention and a slightly sweeter taste. How can I modify the recipe to get get this closer? Beersmith estimated FG to be 1.010 and I finished at 1.012 so I wouldn't think that caused it to be less sweet than expected.

"Verdant vs east coast side by side Full disclosure I tried to post about this yesterday, but had to delete the post after my brew partner had a good laugh. The taps were switched. Turns out I compared two totally different beers. 

Now we are doing this properly. 

9gallon split batch of neipa

OG 1.068
Verdant FG 1.016
East coast FG 1.013

75% 2 row
15% wheat malt
10% flaked oats 

Bitter to 15 ibus 

Citra/azacca 50/50 at a rate of 1oz total hops per gallon in the whirlpool, and 1oz total hops per gallon dry hop

Both beers were Fermented @65¬∞,  in corny kegs with a blow off for the first 72 hours, at which point they received one large dry hop addition, blow offs were pulled, floating dip tubes attached, and enough pressure was applied to seat lids. The kegs were left for a week to finish up, and aggressively cold crashed for 3 days before a sample

Hard to tell in the photo, but the beers look quite similar. The east coast is slightly less opaque, and seems to hold its head better, but I will say there is a possibility of slightly different carbonation levels just due to the natural carb starting up at possibly different points in the time line.

Smell: 

-east coast smells very punchy, lots of peach and mango, little bit of dry citrus. Seems to sit heavy in your nose, but comes in distinct waves

-verdant smells of mostly of apricot and citrus, with that almost vanilla yogurt thing happening. However the scent is more of a mix of things, rather than several distinct different flavors it almost has a fruit salad or smoothie thing going on. 

Taste:

-east coast tastes peachy, ripe mango, little herbal, and some grapefruit thing seems to happen at the end. Has a sweetness about it

-verdant tastes mostly mango, some pineapple, and Some stone fruit, once again with that little twinge of vanilla yogurt. Seems less sweet despite higher FG

Mouth feel:

-east coast feels pretty thick and silky, and has a coating bitterness that sticks around. Very round feeling. Perhaps a touch oily

-verdant also nice and thick and silky mouth feel. Seems a little bit lighter and brighter. Still quite round, and also with some bitterness that sticks around. No oily feel

Honestly they are both quite good. If you like a more balanced and drinkable neipa I would go with verdant. If you are looking for something a little more aggressive I would go with east coast. As is my usual experience with London iii based strains, it tends to blend everything together well. I usually find that Conan type strains are more aggressive and push individual aromas and flavors. 

Over all pleased with both.

"Kveik Cider Recipe Was having a hard time finding information about using Hothead kveik in cider. So i gave it a shot. Definitely not a ground breaking recipes, but here it is. Apple juice is from Costco.

Kveik cider
- 2 gallons of kirkland apple juice (be sure it has no preservatives)
- 3 cinnamon sticks
-Half cup of white granulated sugar 
-quarter cup of brown sugar
- yeast nutrients (follow package instructions)
- pectic enzyme for clarity (follow package instructions)
- omega hothead yeast (half packet)

Mix all of the ingredients together in your fermenter then pitch the yeast.

Starting gravity should be around 1.068

Kviek likes it hot, so I use a heating pad and an inkbird to keep the temperature around 80ish. Was shooting for 85 but it hovered at 83 for most of the fermentation. Took about a week. [fermenting kveik cider](https://imgur.com/gallery/W1NTTr2)

Final og of around 1.004

I then add a campden tablet and back sweeten the cider. This is to taste, but I used 1 can of apple juice concentrate.

"Keg Fermentation: I make stupid mistakes so you don't have to. I got a 2.5 gallon keg to play around with fermentation in a keg, no chill, and pressure fermentation. I'm only 5 months into this hobby, so everything is still new. I have to take each step slowly and deliberately as I get the process down. Now, I've gotten about 10 brew days under my belt and feeling that I am starting to get the hang of things. 

Yesterday morning, I try an ESB and get it in my keg to chill by noon. Later that evening, after a few beers, I check the keg and it is cool enough to pitch yeast. I still haven't worked with spunding valves enough, so I hook up a blow off tube instead. It worked well on the last batch to hook up a blow off and then switch to a spunding valve after a day or two.

Now, when I first got a keg, I did make a mental note that I should label these posts ""gas"" and ""beer"", but I never followed through. In my late night fog, I looked at the out valve and thought, ""Hey, blowoff pushes gas ""out,"" so I need to connect to the out post.""

The first thing I check this morning is if activity has started, and I go into the garage to check. As I stare at a full blowoff jug full and a puddle on the floor my first thought is ""that is a really active fermentation."" Then slow realization set in. I am replacing all my beer in the keg with Co2. Fortunately, I was using a 1 gallon jug for blowoff, so the mess wan't too bad. Unfortunately, I just lost a gallon plus on a 2.5 gallon brew.

"TIFU - fishpuke edition I've been slowly getting back into brewing after a big bad year (before corona). Basically, I haven't been 'in it' for about 2 and a half years now. 

I have some pretty old malts that I wanted to use to make 'whatever' beers. I bought some fresh hops, yeast and intended to just made whatever with the malts.  I figured Id split brew day in two so I mashed up on Thursday. 

My plan was to mash thursday, do what I needed to Friday and then boil and pitch Saturday night. I figured there was a small chance that there be an infection, but that the beers already gonna have old malt, what harm is there in having it be funky too? 

I was right. 

When I looked this morning, the airlock I put on the wort was blubbing. not crazy fast, but not so slow that I couldn't catch it happening. No big deal, I put it outside in the cold to stall for time and started my shift.

Got off work, cleaned the kitchen up and then went to get the wort. As soon as I started transferring, I could smell fish oil.

Then the second wave hit, and I could smell like, 'distant puke'.

For a SECOND I was considering brewing anyway.

I thought better of it and poured the lot of it out. 30 ish litres of wort :(

I've been stewing since, thinking about what went wrong and I think I realized it...

After the mash, I bottled the wort raw... It never reached a boil, *[you know, on account of my not making any kind of effort to boil it](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d6a/dc7/4a5001b7beea096457f480c8808572428b-09-roll-safe.rhorizontal.w700.jpg)*. My small chance of having an infection got raised too **'You just inoculated you're worth with every micro-organism that blew across a farm for months'**

I took an edible instead, and now I'm looking at the bright side of things. Those were old stale malts. The good yeast is crazy healthy, and I've not used any of my resupply of hops.

I think I'm going to try another split brew day... But there will be a small boil at least and it will be a next day affair, not a skip day thing.",Homebrewing

"SS Brewtech 14gal Unitank Hi all, UK based if that helps at all, I am thinking of purchasing one of the above. As I understand it, there are quire few extras that are needed to make it live up to its potential!

I will need the FTSS¬≤ as I don't have a fridge or freezer large enough for it. I own a Maxi 310 Chiller so plan to use that for the cooling side. Will have to somehow rig that to work with the FTSS¬≤ controller.

I will buy the spunding valve for pressurising the beer towards the end of fermentation.

I will need a 3""CIP ball for cleaning - plus some tubing, an elbow and TC barbs to connect the CIP, the bottom port and my pump.

I will need some kind of connector for the blowoff ball valve as it just ends on a 1/2"" female NPT port as far as I can tell.

I'll need a 1.5"" TC to barb for the transfer port.

I'll need a 1.5"" TC to something connector on the trub dump port to dump the trub...

Is there anything i'm forgetting or am I overthinking all this?

Also the spunding valve setup and FTSS¬≤ kit are both out of stock on the Malt Miller site... starting to think I might just not bother! Have I just talked myself out of this?",Homebrewing
"Using glass beverage dispenser as cask/firkin? I currently have a Burton/Old Ale finishing primary in a 5L glass beverage dispenser, similar to [this one](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gibson-Home-Bayfront-Summer-2-6-Qt-Glass-Drink-Dispenser-for-Cold-Drinks-985112060M/310646975), kind of like a quasi-open fermentor (seal removed and wire lock not engaged, so the lid is held in place by gravity)  


Seems to be working well, so now I am wondering if I could use it for cask ageing (and later, dispensing) the same, as well. The dispenser is obviously not pressure rated, but the glass is thick and I've replaced the original plastic spigot with a proper stainless one. The style calls for low pressure (I've seen as low as 1.0 atm cited) so it shouldn't create too much strain.  


Can I just prime, seal the lid, and let it sit a couple of months (probably inside a cooler to contain any mishaps)? Would I need to open the lid during serving to manage headspace?  


I am also thinking about adding some toasted oak staves, which I already have from cocktail aging projects, to simulate the wood of a traditional firkin.",Homebrewing
"Verdant yeast vs. east coast So I am now on my second brew with lalbrew verdant, and decided to split the batch and also try lalbrew east coast.

Made 9 gallons of wort, and split it into two seperate corny kegs, pitched verdant in one and east coast in the other. Fermented at 68¬∞f. Dry hop 72 hours in, and attached floating dip tubes to serve out of same keg. 

Now that they have been sitting for about a week I pulled my first pint of each.

Both batches 1.068
Verdant FG 1.016
East coast FG 1.014

75% 2 row
15% wheat malt
10% flaked oats

Bittered to 15 ibus

Even split of Citra and azacca in both the whirlpool and dry hop at a rate of 1oz/gallon 

So far, the verdant is significantly darker than the east coast, and it has more dank aroma. Getting a lot more herb and pine with some fruit n the background. Almost more like a fruity west coast. Also very viscus. 

The east coast is way waaaaaay lighter, way more citrus, pineapple, and peach vibes, lighter mouth feel. More traditional to a neipa style. Lighter mouth feel.

Both of these beers were fermented in kegs with blow off tubes for 72 hours before dry hopping, sealing and oxygen purging. Left to sit for a week, then tipped up with CO2 and put into the fridge to cold crash.

"NEIPA astringency makes me sad Hi chaps,

I am distraught. I finally decided to brew my first NEIPA and used the Average NE IPA recipe everyone gave good feedback on (https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/363082/avg-perfect-northeast-ipa-neipa-). I got galaxy and honey malt from a different country, set water chem and mash temps well. Didnt pitch too hot for once. I thought I did everything well, but this came out my worst batch so far. What I did was pressure ferment after 72hrs and dry hopped both charges at once at 72hrs. I tasted a sample on day 4 and unsurpsingly it was bitter and horrid. I coldcrashed day 8 and kegged day 9. It is now 1 week after kegging and while the astringency has decresed, it is still acrid. 

  I get a nice sweet aromatic hit up front but rapidly turns to discusting bitterness at the back of the mouth. Can I salvage this? I will give it one more week in the keg and if not improved will fine with geletine. So bleak about this as it has been the style I have most been looking forward to when I started brewing 5 months ago. I love this hobby and will not give up

"Pitch possibly dead yeast with new? I purchased the Hop Monster IPA kit from NB this summer at the end of July. I added on their recommended yeast packs for it. When my order arrived I open the box grab up the one loose brown envelop saying refrigerate immediately and placed it in the fridge.

I'm guessing since these have been sitting in the hot garage ever since they arrived in the box they are no longer good.

"RIS aging hack, at least potentially Disclaimer: based on a sample size of 1

Made my batch of RIS (see recipe at the end of the post) slightly oversized so that I could bottle a few.  The last bottle got only half-filled.  Since I used my normal bottle-a-few procedure of measuring sugar individually into bottles, that bottle had the ~right amount of sugar to carbonate properly.  I decided to cap it so that I could check if carbonation was happening -- never know when you push US-05 past 11% -- without having to waste a full bottle.  Didn't purge the bottle with CO2, because I was just planning to use it to check carbonation and pour it down the drain if it was oxidized.

A week later I opened the bottle and first of all it was fully carbonated (go US-05!).  What was even more surprising is how ready it tasted.  The roast from packaging day was hugely subdued, and there was ample raspberry, chocolate and vanilla.  It was a great beer!  So, two days later I opened a full bottle, and while it also was carbonated, it reminded me of the raw bottling day sample and was nothing like the half-filled bottle.

My hypothesis is that oxidation super-accelerated the aging, and due to sufficient roast etc. the RIS was able to stand up to it.  Does anyone else have experiences with half-filled RIS bottles, or care to otherwise postulate what caused the half-full bottle to mature in a week?

"Storing homebrew in keg/torp for the sub by Krups Recently got the sub as a birthday present and I got a homebrew kit last year which I have yet to use. I really want to store my own brew in the kegs to use in the sub. It would be a great way to store it and refrigerate it. 

Only issue is krups don't make reusable kegs/torps for the machine. I don't know whether this is a health and safety issue or its just monetisation, but its probably the latter. But, I have seen people finding out ways to make these torps reusable. It involves cleaning the attachment hose, pump air into the torp to inflate the collapsed inner bag and just seal in again with the attachment hose. This method seems fine if you're just filling it up, chilling and using it. But I am unsure how safe it is for storing. 

If I am to do this I know I will need to disinfect the torp before filling them up. And it will need to be chemically disinfected as the torps are plastic.

"BIAB expected efficiency problem. Been on my mind and fleeting in and out of understanding for a year or so now. I think I finally have it figured out. When I use [Brewers Friend All grain OG/FG calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/allgrain-ogfg/) for BIAB to estimate my efficiencies, I Always have trouble getting the pre boil and post boil to match up. 

The variables are:

grain bill, pre-boil volume, post-boil volume, efficiency

If I put my full volume (lets say I fill my kettle to 30L at the start of my brewday) into the calculator, then the calculator correctly estimates my mash. Take this much water, add this much grain, at this %efficiency, and you get the right number. Easy. 

Now, in order to get the correct post-boil gravity, I would have to factor in the amount of both LIQUID and SUGAR lost when I pull my grain. The calculator only accounts for liquid lost. There's no way to account for the loss of sugar in the wort when I pull my grain bag. 

SO... the problem is if I enter my preboil volume to match the volume after I have pulled my grain (say 27L, to carry on with the example before) then the calculator just over-calculates my pre-boil OG, and thus my post-boil OG. If I leave the full volume as the preboil (30L) and then just go with it and enter my post boil (24L) then it calculates a huge boil off and my pre boil gravity is correct and my post boil gravity is way over what it truly should be. 

SOLUTION: use the OG/FG calculator for only my full volume pre-boil OG. Then take that number to this [Dilution and Boiloff calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/dilution-and-boiloff-gravity-calculator/), where I can enter my pre-boil OG, my \*true\* pre boil volume (27L, after loss to grain absorption), and my target volume after my 60 minute boil. 

But in reality I'm just going to start recording and referring to full volume pre-boil gravity alone for efficiency marks. I'll still record my actual pre-boil, post- boil, and FG. But for recipe planning and to make sure I'm hitting my numbers during brewday, I'll only be using the pre-boil gravity from this calculator.

"Hose Length on a Keg - always necessary? I'll start by saying I'm running a real shoestring budget operation here, so most of my set-up is less than ideal.

I usually chill the keg down using a bucket of ice, and carb using a real CO2 bottle and the rocking/shake method.  Then I put in the fridge I use a tap handle that connects directly to the out post to dispense(party keg style), with a 16 gram C02 cartridge on the in post.

I have been getting heavy foam(about half a pilsner glass) off  the keg, which is usually at its worst when the keg is full, and decreases to perfection around the last few pours.  The beer itself is lightly carbonated when the foam goes down.

I have mostly been attributing this to the keg being too warm and not absorbing the CO2, but I always see posts on this forum recommending 10-12 feet of hose length in a kegorator type set-up.  Of course my hose length is effectively zero.  Is this my issue?

"Crisp lager without temp control Hi,

I want to ferment a lagerlike beer with a perceivable but not IPAesque hop character. So a sizeable flameout addition of 2,1% tettnang will be made. The bittering addition will probably be either centennial or citra at first wort with a 60min boil. This shouldn't affect the flavour right? What IBU do yall think is appropriate?

 I will decoction mash a grainbill of 100% pilsner malt. Does 56C for 15 mins then 66C for 45minutes sound good? The target is 4-5% abv.

My main problem is what yeast to use and what water profile and pH to target.

1. what yeast to use? My room temperature is 19-20C. Right now im debating the following: saflager 37/70, Voss kveik, or buying some Oslo kveik.

2. What water profile to use? Again, the target is a crisp beer and i can adjust the pH with lactic acid. My tap water is the following:

Hey all, I'm about keg up my Octoberfest beer tomorrow in preparation for my buddy's Halloween party (don't worry, we're just a few couples that have been ""bubbling"" together since April). I want to start bottling a portion of my beer so that I can sample my previous brews long after the keg is tapped and keep a diverse selection beyond my 1-2 kegs on tap. I'm force carbing the keg but I'm going to condition the bottles.

Before, when I would bottle a whole batch, I would bring some dextrose water to a boil to sanitize the priming sugar before racking to a bottling bucket. Now I want to try priming each bottle separately since I'm only bottling a small portion.

Unfortunately I didn't have the forethought to buy carb drops or dextrose from my LHBS and with all that's going on this weekend, I don't think I'll have time to stop by. My closest LHBS is unfortunately 45 mins away and they've gone to curbside pickup only with the year's current events which adds another layer of logistics, it's just not likely in the cards.

That brings me to regular table sugar from the wife's baking supplies. Do I need to worry at all about sanitizing the sugar before bottling? This is going to be a well used bag of sugar that's seen its share of time on the counter. I've read some people simply put 1 tsp. of table sugar into the bottle when racking. Are there any other methods I could use? Looking for any advice, and if you think I should skip this batch for when I'm better prepared, I'm all for it. Thanks!",Homebrewing

"Opinions on Homebrew Setups Currently I have a three tier system using a cooler mashtun, 8gal HLT, and 15 Gal Spike Boil Kettle (all propane).

Currently just looking for feedback from anyone who has used or has experience moving from cooler mashtun brewing to electric systems. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- 10 Gal Blichmann BrewEasy

Seems like one of the best quality ""all in one"" systems out there. I typically brew 5 gal batches but I do not like the fact that the 5 gal setup has a smaller mashtun than what I currently utilize (7.5 gal vs 10 gal cooler). I like having the ability of brewing a 10 gal batch or a 5 gal batch especially at this higher price point. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- RIMS system utilizing my current Spike Boil Kettle

Probably utilize a the RIM Rocket from Blichmann for this. It would require me to have at least 2 240 outlets run to the brew area. This system obviously would take up more space, and have more parts to clean. But the thing I like about the Spike kettles is the welded bulkheads, which Blichmann kettles lack. For almost the same cost I would come up with a full 3 kettle brew system.

"Running a 220V/240V system in the US Hi all, 

I know this has been asked a few times, but I haven't yet come across a ""best"" solution yet.  
I have a 240V Grainfather that I purchased and used while overseas, but now I am in the US. I've read a few options ranging from:

1. Getting a heatstick &amp; jacket to make up for the lost power
2. wiring a GFCI outlet into the dryer/washer outlet or breaker
3. some janky wiring of two 120V outlets into one plug (not looking to do this... just saw it around)
4. getting a beefy (5000W?) transformer to step up a 120V outlet to 240V

I'm not an electrician and don't really feel like its worth hiring someone with doing number 2 or 3, especially as I'm renting. 

Will a transformer do the job?   
Will I be able to get a rolling boil if I just plug into a 110V outlet? 

I don't mind if things are a little slower, but I'm worried about if it'll get to rolling at all... If a transformer is the ""budget"" fix to this without doing any electrical work, that'd be great.

I have made this mistake not once but 3 times, the first 2 were heavily hopped, there was something off about them, I thought I must have bought some bad hops or something, the third was a blonde.  With fewer hops for it to hide behind the sulfur aroma is very prominent.

"SG -&gt; Maltose/Dextrin ratio?! I've just recently started homebrewing and have a question that I can't crack myself:

So my understanding is that the measured SG tells how much sugar is in our wort, i. e. how much starch has gotten converted into Maltose/Dextrin.

Now here's what got me puzzled: how is it possible to predict the final gravity of the beer after fermentation (as tools out there do) when we can't actually know how much of that total sugar is Maltose (i. e. fermentable by the pitched yeast) and how much of that is Dextrin (i. e. non-fermentable). 

I am thinking that as the Dextrin doesn't get fermented, the amount of Dextrin in the total SG should remain unchanged during the fermentation phase while the Maltose does get fermented effectively causing the SG to drop.

Obviously I'm off here somehow and I'd really appreciate if someone more experienced/knowledgeable would shed some light on this.

.75 lb Chocolate Malt 
.75 lb Special B 
.5  lb Crystal 120

15 min - 0.5 oz Northern Brewer (9.9% AA)

2- Do I had any sugar ( I remember my friend adding sugar in his recipe) ? Or do I just add sugar when I put in the bottle ?

"What do your brewday notes look like? I use Brewfather almost always. But at times, I do like the romantic feel of jotting on a notepad to capture a gravity sample, a hop addition, etc. I find these interesting to look at when reflecting on brewdays and recipes. That being said, I'm not happy with how my note taking ""flows"" throughout the process and I'd benefit from seeing how others are structuring their notes. I'm curious what your notes look like when you go analog. Here's mine from yesterday.

"Sanitizing Apple Wood Chunk before long Hot Sauce pepper mash fermentation Looking to do a 3+ month chili pepper fermentation and have Apple wood chunks for smoking. 

Saw previous posts about soak in whiskey/bourbon for 3 weeks and also an 8 year old post about steaming for 15 minutes, but not trying to add another flavor to this fermentation and also not trying to add water to this mash. 

1. How would you recommend Sanitizing these wood chunks before a long food fermentation without liquor or steam?

2. Or would you recommend steaming and just using a brine instead of a mash?

3. Lastly, think I should bust these chunks into wood chips before the ferment? I'm concerned that more wood chips and more surface area might mean more chances for splinters to get into the peppers, whereas the chunks as they are, are pretty rounded and the sides aren't splintered.",Homebrewing

"2 month update on the 16% ABV stout, plus what's going in the barrel next! My monsterous stout has been in the barrel for over two months. I sent a sample to a lab for fun, and it came back at [15.73% ABV](https://imgur.com/a/KOHGdTl), which is about what I estimated since I was topping off with lower abv stout during aging. It'll probably drop down to 15.6% by the time I bottle.

I've had several small tastings from the nail just to track progress. It's damn good. Medium-full bodied, boozy brownies, loads of chocolate, dark coffee, some toasty vanillins, a bit of raisin, and a great bourbon background. The best part is that even drinking flat and warm at this ridiculous ABV and young age, it is totally delicious and not hot. Sure, it's got alcohol warmth, but I detect only miniscule higher alcohol heat, which I'm pretty sensitive to.

Don't let the 1.022 FG fool you, it still has plenty of sweetness. This is because of the difference between apparent and real attenuation which is really showcased in a super high ABV beer.

Honestly though, I think it lacks what makes a RIS a RIS, so I won't be calling it that anymore. It isn't roasty enough, and the sweetness really cuts down the relatively low roast. It also isn't as astringent as I feel it should be.

If I did this again, I would consider doubling the roast barley and mashing higher for more dextrins while drying it out with dextrose since it is pretty damn sweet. Going for same body, less sweetness with much more roast.

Overall, a great high ABV desert stout. Again, not really a RIS.

This fades over time, but then I find that by the end of the keg the beer keeps tasting better and better, well past when the hops has faded. 

I was thinking for the next time I brew this beer it might be a good idea to age it first for 3 months or so, then dryhop, hoping to get the best of both worlds. 

Is this a good idea or a dumb idea?

0.4 oz Magnum hops (25 IBU)

2L starter of Escarpment Isar lager yeast. crashed and decanted

Water profile was yellow malty. 90 minute mash at 148F. All hops at 60 minutes to get a smooth bitterness. Dextrose added at the end of the boil along with 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient.

    - the skin of 1 pineapple, center and some pulp
    - 1 habanero
    - 1 cinammon stick
    - 1 oz peepled and cubed ginger
    - the juice of one lemon
    - 7 oz organic tamarind pulp
    -------------------- 

I used the yeast from the pineapple's skin and pitched a little of voss slurry I had from a blonde ale I made a couple months back, it took off in half an hour.

I did not take an OG reading because I had no hydrometer but I am guessing the liquid is at least 1.075.

I want to naturally carbonate this. When should it be a good time for this? Prime as usual? Do I have to age this?

Thanks in adavance, cheers.",Homebrewing
"Wiring a spa panel for ebiab gfi I've been all over HBT and elsewhere trying to get my head around wiring a spa panel, but the posts I've found that have detailed wiring diagrams etc don't quite match my situation. I'm plugging into a NEMA 14-30 outlet for my dryer, and my controller plugs into the same kind of outlet. Almost all of the diagrams etc I've seen are folks trying to work with 3 wire setups. Anyone have a pointer to a post, diagram, video, etc? Trying not to kill myself and I'm pretty new to all this.",Homebrewing
"What can I ferment at 60-65¬∞F? The basement in the spot i just moved to stays a pretty steady 60-65¬∞F, wondering what styles would work best around these temps? Relatively new so simple is good, thanks so much!",Homebrewing
"Does a decoction mash with wheat leave a bread-crust flavor? I tasted a beer with a high amount of unmalted wheat in it, and it had a bread-crust type flavor that was fairly unique, and I was not very fond of it. I don't recall the brewery, but I do recall it was from Europe so I assumed decoction was on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware decoction produces melanoidins. This is what I'd like to obtain. I'm also aware that a good deal of starch is left unconverted if it's not malted before the mash, even with an appropriate diastatic power. This is what I worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask because I wanted to try a decoction mash as an experiment, but my go-to experiment recipe uses a large amount of unmodified wheat, and if I won't like it, it'll change how I run my experiment.",Homebrewing
