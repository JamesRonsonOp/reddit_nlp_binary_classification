Resources for a newbie home winemaker,"Resources for a newbie home winemaker I want to find a comprehensive resource (book, website, forum...etc) to learn home winemaking in a principled way.

What to add. How much to add. When to add it. Why it is needed. When it can be skipped. Steps and directions. What to measure and record. What to look out for. Common problems, how to spot and troubleshoot them...etc.

I know there are bits and pieces of this information here and there in Reddit and perhaps other forums.

What I am looking for though is a well-put-together resource that would hopefully have all the basics covered in a well-organized way.

Maybe a book? I looked for one on Amazon, but there seem to only be a few and their reviews aren‚Äôt the best.",winemaking
A question about kit wine,"A question about kit wine I‚Äôve made quite a few batches that have all come out pretty good.

Riesling - My First Wine,"Riesling - My First Wine Hi Everyone,

I am going to make some riesling for the first time. This is also the first wine I am making. I would like some general tips and hacks, Google is proving very hard for me as there doesn't appear to be many good resources available unlike beer making! 

I am using a concentrate kit to make 23 Litres that claims to have everything in it that is required. I have also got at home fermaid A.

The guide says to ferment at 20 degrees C. I will probably opt not to do this and cold ferment at around 13 degrees C. I think it best to order in some specific yeast as the kit does not say what yeast I have - any advice? 

Any other tips? Ideal water profile for diluting the concentrate? I also have french oak spirals has anyone ever put them in? Here in Adelaide Riesling does come very, very lightly oaked occasionally",winemaking
Persimmon Wine Straining?,"Persimmon Wine Straining? Hello! This is my first time making Persimmon wine/cider and my first attempt at doing a wild yeast ferment. 

We prepped them by cutting out any brown/black/moldy spots and cored them (approx. 22 lbs/10kilos) 

Added to a 5 gallon bucket with 8 liters of water and an amount of sugar (all of this was guesstimated from a recipe online) (I will be adding more sugar down the line in the next fermentation steps.)

We were worried the fruit wouldnt break down enough on its own so we scooped out ripe pieces and blended them up. Now we have an extremely thick and viscous liquid that I am unsure will filter out very easily.

What should we do? Will the solids fall out eventually? Should we just try to strain it and hope for the best? The consistency is somewhat like slightly watery grape jam.",winemaking

Noobie Question about bottling,"Noobie Question about bottling This is probably a stupid question but I bought a winemaking kit and it came with a transparent starter hose and a glass push down bottler that is supposed to fill the wine bottles from the bottom up.

No one on youtube explains it and the two outside diameters are slightly different (by maybe a millimeter or two. I triple checked and can find no connectors in the kit. I debated duct taking them together but decided not to. 

I've heard lots of people mention clamps of some sort, but I don't know what sort specifically and I don't think a screw down hose clamp from Lowe's would be very useful. I assume this is very simple and I'm just being clueless, but could someone please explain how this is supposed to work?",winemaking

Instant Pot...Wine?,"Instant Pot...Wine? Hey, a poster in another sub recently asked about making wine in an Instant Pot.

So out of curiosity, is there any GOOD reason you would do [this](https://www.today.com/recipes/instant-pot-wine-recipe-t124206)?

Is there a way to evaporate water from an ongoing plum Oloroso sherry?,"Is there a way to evaporate water from an ongoing plum Oloroso sherry? Long story short, me and my father discovered a long forgotten half-filled jug of now aged and oxidized plum wine. I decided to do something creative out of it. I'm currently continuing the oxidation process to give it the more clear caramel hints that you often find in Oloroso sherry, and I've also cleared out the hydrogen sulphur odour, so it's going great so far!

However I'm curious if there is a way to allow to the water to evaporate a bit to concentrate the flavors and the alcohol to make it go from 14% -&gt; 18%, like they do in certain types of fortified wines. I know the acid will become concentrated too, and I plan to deal with it later on. I don't have any oak barrels on hand though, and AFAIK they do play a role on allowing the evaporation of water. Are there any methods that a simple homewinemaker can partake in?",winemaking

The wine is still quite young, just over 3 weeks old from when it was placed in a carboy, and has been racked twice. 

I notice the lees always build up eventually at the bottom. You cant really see the cloudy nature of the wine unless you shine a torch to it up close. There is about a 1cm line of what looks like clear red wine and the rest below it is murky / cloudy. Its been like that since day 1.

During the 6 months or so that they didn‚Äôt have wine in them before this batch, they were filled with sulfited-water and topped every month or so... however.... when I popped a bottle to give the batch an early taste, it was clear that it had been infected with something - a moldy taste. Not overwhelming, but right at the edge of what I‚Äôd call drinkable and definitely not what I was shooting for. I just gave the barrels a good whiff and they have the same smell - so this is the probable source.

When to carboy? What am I factoring in here?,"When to carboy? What am I factoring in here? Hi y'all! First time posting here! Am usually stuck in r/fermenting.

I'm curious what things people consider when moving their wine from a bucket to a carboy.

For context I have a cranberry wine that I started about two months ago now. original gravity was 1.098... currently at  1.053.

Its naturally fermenting so nothing added apart from sugar at the beginning to get the og where I wanted it.

It's definitely still fermenting. I get a little burble from the air lock every twenty minutes or so. 

It has about an inch of head room in the bucket ( strained the solids out a while ago)

I'm basically waiting for the gravity to go down a fair bit more before moving it. But everytime I check up on it I'm just like why wouldn't I just do this now?

Can you use argon wine preserving gas to decrease oxidation speed in a carboy?,"Can you use argon wine preserving gas to decrease oxidation speed in a carboy? We just racked over some plum wine to a few pet carboys for clearing. However there wasn't enough to completely fill up to the neck on one of the carboys, so it's currently sitting filled up to right below where the carboy starts to narrow down, so it will probably eventually oxidize if we let it sit like that for too long. We could add some glass marbles into the carboy, but we feel it will be a too messy job during clearing, and want to wait with that until the wine has been cleared and racked and is ready for the bulk aging process. So we need a temporary solution during a few weeks. 

I was thinking since the wine has been sitting in the fermentation bucket for a few weeks now without oxidizing thanks to the protective CO2 layer, wouldn't it be possible to make a similar short term solution by adding argon gas to the carboy from a wine preserving gas can - assuming we add it properly? Argon gas is heavier than regular air similar to CO2, and is odourless, so it should form a protective layer as well. Not saying this is a permanent solution, only during the few weeks of clearing.

Elderflower wine bottling day: first wine!,"Elderflower wine bottling day: first wine! I wanted to share my first wine bottling day. I started this elderflower wine in June. After reading a bunch of recipes, I settled on the following per 1-gallon batch: 

* 1 pint elderflower heads
* 200 g raisins
* 1 t acid blend
* 1/2 t tannin
* Sugar to 1.09 SG
* SN9 yeast
* 1 t yeast nutrients

After bulk aging for about 5 months, the wine was dry and seemed to be degassed. It's not quite as clear as I'd hoped, but that's not the most important thing to me. 

I expected a light floral aroma and delicate flavor, but the wine smelled and tasted like slightly acidic raisin water. However, I'm recovering from COVID, and my smell and taste are not 100% back yet, so I'm hoping that's part of the problem. After adding a bit of sugar, I thought the flavor was pleasant and not quite so thin, but I couldn't define the flavor. I'm hoping that by next summer it will be more enjoyable to drink.

Question: I've read that European elderberries are more flavorful than American elderberries. Are the flowers more aromatic, too? I picked flowers that were mostly open and still white, but they weren't especially aromatic when fresh either.

Wine question from a liqueur maker: Can you fortify to shelf stability?,"Wine question from a liqueur maker: Can you fortify to shelf stability? Hi everyone, looking for some wisdom on fortifying wine until it's able to live on a shelf ‚Äî or whether that's possible.

I make Italian-style bitter liqueurs, and I read in an old recipe book about swapping in wine in addition to water to proof down the final ABV. I added port to a mix, ending up at about 36% ABV. I know that's good as far as regular liqueur shelf stability, but I can't wrap my head around whether the spirit will fortify the wine, or if the wine will still oxidize if left open but corked on a shelf.

SO: Will the presence of *any* wine mean I'll need to put the bottle in the fridge after opening, the same way you would with vermouth, or will high enough alcohol content allow it to live on the shelf like a regular liqueur?

Thanks everyone, hoping to get to the bottom of this! If anyone wants to add a bonus answer, I'd love to understand why you can age wine in barrels, but uncorking a bottle starts a countdown until it goes back.",winemaking

My first ever primary fermentation has been going for 7 days now and bubbles in the airlock have reduced and are now few and far between.

After an initial test with the hydrometer my reading looks to be around 0.960.

Primary Ferment Gravity Showing 0.998 in 5 days?!,"Primary Ferment Gravity Showing 0.998 in 5 days?! Hi all!  


I'm new to winemaking, and this is my first ever batch. 

So, I ended up buying around 18kg of seedless black grapes from my local supermarket (they were really good quality, grown in Peru &amp; Brazil) and have a really deep colour to the juice.

I crushed the grapes and placed them into a fermentation bucket with an airlock. I have only punched the cap down once a day, when I know some people have done it at least twice to four times a day. This might have been a mistake, I'm not sure yet. 

The initial gravity of the juice before pitching the yeast was 1.090. Today is the evening of day 5, and I decided to test the gravity as the bubbling of the airlock slowed down drastically. It read at 0.998. I heard this is when fermentation is completely done, but I also heard it should be around 1.030 at this stage. I did find a blog article saying that fermentation *can* be done in as little as 5 days, although rare. 

My questions are:  


1. Is it bad that fermentation is done at this point?  
 
2. I would still like to clarify the wine by letting it sit in a carboy and racking once or twice - can I do that?  

3. I tasted the wine and it tastes more on the acidic side, with not much body - will those acidic flavours mellow out with age? The alcohol is definitely there!

Thanks folks!",winemaking
A question about punch down and sanitizing equipment,"A question about punch down and sanitizing equipment Hello everyone, I'm new to winemaking and I'm currently starting homebrewing some fruit wines and i have a couple of questions regarding primary fermentation and punching down the fruit cap. 

So, I'm currently doing a batch of persimmon wine in a 25 lt fermentation vessel, and i've added the yeast a couple of days ago. Problem is that after one day the solids of the must rose above the liquid and i was wondering what to do with that. So I started looking online and i found out about punching down, which i didn't know a thing about( as i said this is my first project regarding fruit wines).

My question is: is it safe to punch down the fruit cap with a steel less ladle or something like that? should i sanitize it every time before punching down the cap? I'm worried about spoilage and i've got to say that there's another thing that isn't clear to me: reading about wine making/cider making it seemed to me that you want to reduce the contact with oxygen as much as yo can during fermentation, but to what extent? I' m beginning to understand that is much more crucial during secondary fermentation while during primary it isn't that much of a cause of concern(maybe also because yeast do need oxygen during alcoholic fermentation? i don't really know so any kind of explanation is very much appreciated). So is it ok to open the the vessel a couple of times a day to punch down the fruit cap? should i also mix everything when i do this?

Last question regarding sanitizing the equipment: with the fermentation vessel i also got some e224 potassium metabisulphite to sanitize the vessel and the equipment, as said in the instructions pamphlet. is it ok for sanitizing everything? I usually wash the equipment in a water solution with e224, then rinse again the equipment with water.

Also can i keep the solution in a container for a few days and re-use it? or is it better to throw it away  and making it again every time?

Spontaneous Fermentation - To Add Sulfites or No?,"Spontaneous Fermentation - To Add Sulfites or No? So I made my first wine with wild grapes using spontaneous fermentation (I did add sugar and diluted with water to raise the pH). So far it seems to be going according to plan. Fermentation was great. Definitely tastes like a red wine that just needs to age--but a little tart. 

I pressed it about a month and a half ago, then racked it off sediment about two weeks ago. I plan to bottle this weekend. 

My question is, do I even need to add sulfites? I haven't so far. I have been VERY careful about oxidation, especially after fermentation has completed. I've filled my jugs up to the top and what not. So, from say a home-brewing perspective (which is what I'm way more familiar with), I wouldn't be worried about oxidation. 

But, with bottling, I do slightly worry because I know these bottles will be aging... for a while. 

So, should I add campden tablets? Part of me doesn't want to. I like the thought of the old-timey times when they wouldn't have been able to do that sort of thing. I know it's a buzzword--but I did want to make this wine as natural as possible. 

But, if I do decide I want to add sulfites, how many campden tablets should I add? I've got about two gallons--a 1 gallon jug filled to the top, a 64 oz growler filled to the top, and a 32 oz howler filled to the top... I figure the headspace I filled amounts to the remainder of the second gallon. 

And, how long should I wait after adding, if I do decide to add, can I bottle?

Also--any tips on reducing the tartness/acidity would be appreciated.",winemaking

Does the lees help to protect the wine?,"Does the lees help to protect the wine? Whenever I make wine, after the first racking I put a little sample of what's left into a little ""potion"" bottle.

As such I periodically open the sample bottle to smell the wine, many times whenever I am bored. This means the sample gets exposed to oxygen fairly often. However, the sample never seems to go bad.

This summer, I discovered five massive vines of vitis labrusca growing across from my house in wetlands. 

So late September I harvested my Aglianico and a whole bunch of the fox grapes, basically whatever I could get my hands on that were ripe and in low brush. 

I ended up with maybe 8lbs of grapes, total. Like anyone who just wants to experiment, I decided to try carbonic maceration. I dumped all the grapes into a keg, hit it with enough CO2 to seal, and left it.

And by left it, I mean I left it there for two months. Yesterday I decided I needed the keg and emptied it. When I opened it yesterday, the grapes were sizzling. 

Took the macerated grapes and pressed them to get whatever liquid I could. Ended up with 800mL of young wine, clocking in at 1.010. So I threw all the liquid in a 2000mL Erlenmeyer and let it chill overnight. Today I racked off the sediment into a lone 750mL bottle. 

This wine will either ferment all the way down and I'll end up with a 5 vol sparkling red or it'll stay around there with slight carbonation. I'll crack it sometime this winter and see how it is. It's a pinkish red hue and will probably lighten up a bit more.",winemaking
Topping up with an oxidized wine,"Topping up with an oxidized wine I had about 2.2 Litres of left over wine when I moved from my open ferment to my Demijohns.

No matter I have another 25L happily fermenting away. 

However, I was wondering if anyone thought there would be any problem with using this extra wine to top up vessels with later? or would the oxidization affect any wine that I blended it with? I can't see any reason why not - especially in small amounts but what do people think? 

Worse case scenario, I'll make 2L of vinegar - so its no loss all up really.",winemaking

Why does wine turn into vinegar? (Answer),"Why does wine turn into vinegar? (Answer) [copied from r/BrewingNewbies]

Most people know that vinegar is made from wine, but what makes wine into vinegar in the first place? Well, there are two answers, a long one, and a short one. The short answer is adding additional oxygen after the first week. The long answer is because of a bacteria called Acetobacter. It produces something called acetic acid, it basically makes vinegar, vinegar. Acetobacter uses alcohol and oxygen to produce acetic acid. That's why it's important to not put in any oxygen after the first week, maybe even sooner.
Now how can you prevent that? Well, you can use chemicals like Campden Tablets, Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite. But if you're like me and don't want to use added chemicals then there are a few steps you can take to make sure Acetobacter doesn't have the time or resources to turn your wine into vinegar. First fermenting, as I said above you should never add in more oxygen after the first week, you can keep it out by using an airlock, or by using a siphoning tube when racking or bottling. Second, you can sanitize everything before use. Yes, Acetobacter is on anything and everything but sanitizing will make it so there isn't as much of it when you're brewing. Lastly, you can pasteurize OR cold crash your brew when it's done fermenting (note: this only works if the Acetobacter hasn't already turned your wine into vinegar) this will help kill anything left alive if you're planning on leaving it in long turn storage.
I hope this helped clear up some confusion because I know some people want to hear details and explanations and not just ""don't put in oxygen"".",winemaking
"""Micro-oxygenation"" at home with a silicone bung?","""Micro-oxygenation"" at home with a silicone bung? Hey all,

I know micro-oxygenation is usually done with a special very-low-rate diffuser on a commercial scale, which is practically out of reach for the home winemaker

Could you mimic the process using a silicone bung?

According to this [study of bungs](http://www.better-bottle.com/pdf/ClosuresOxygenPassageStudy.pdf), the oxygen transfer rate of a silicone bung averaged at 19.6 cc / day. A little googling showed me that is approximately equal to 1.5 mg / L of oxygen per day for a 5 gallon enclosure (please feel free to check my working here) - in other words \~45 mg / L / month.

In ""Concepts in Wine Technology"", Yair Margalit suggests an oxygen dosage rate of between 20-60 mg / L / month for MO.

Does that mean I can effectively add a MO protocol to my home setup using a silicone bung and a 5 gallon enclosure? Or does the diffuser do something a bung cannot?",winemaking

Let me give you the numbers: 

Must at crush : 3.38 pH; TA - 7.9g/L
Day of MLF innoculation (post fermentation) - 3.30 pH; TA - 8.2 g/L
1 month into MLF: 3.31 pH 
Today (1.5 months after MLF start): 3.25 pH; TA - 7.7 g/L

I keep the barrel at a constant 22 degrees Celsius at a temp controlled underground cellar. The barrel has an airlock and I often top it up, but I try to introduce oxygen as little as possible. 

My understanding is that during MLF the pH is supposed to increase and the TA to decrease, yet my numbers are wild. Full disclosure - I use Vinmetrica SC300 for measurements and I make sure I make regular calibrations, and all my chemicals are new (this vintage). 

Also, as I am nearing the end of the MLF (I used Vinmetrica SC-55 to measure my malic acid), and it is pretty much there at 0.21kPA reading, would you guys recommend me deacidifying now with potassium bicarbonate, or age it this way and wait until bottling to do so?",winemaking
Siphon off Sediment,"Siphon off Sediment So I‚Äôm a home-brewer new to wine making. For my first time this year, I made about 2 gallons of wine from wild grapes and did natural fermentation. 

After primary fermentation, I pressed my wine‚Äîwhich was on October 8th. I meant to let the sediment settle, then siphon the wine off the sediment.

Well, I got lazy and forgot. Now it‚Äôs been a month and fermentation is definitely done. 

I‚Äôm a little wary to do it now, because I don‚Äôt want to introduce oxygen into the mix. I had filled my jugs up almost to the top, and there was enough C02 from the fermentation that was still happening to purge any remaining oxygen. 

Should I even bother to siphon it off the sediment at this point? Or should I just bottle? 

Also‚Äîwhen should I bottle? Lol it‚Äôs been a month since it went into secondary, is that long enough?",winemaking
flavoring help,"flavoring help i have a blueberry wine that finished not too long ago fermented to or below .990 final gravity at 13%. i back sweetened it to help with how dry it was. i don‚Äôt really taste a whole lot blueberry. the only thing is that it still has like a sourish, mouth puckery like note that‚Äôs still sweet, there is some berry notes there. what would this be from and is there something i can do? or is it something i should let age?",winemaking
Blending wine that completed MLF with one that did not,"Blending wine that completed MLF with one that did not I have 20 gallons of a co-fermented Leon Millot-Aurore wine that we subjected to semi-carbonic maceration for a week. The aroma is exactly where I want it, but the wine turned out almost as a ros√© in color and is quite high in acid and has a thin body. I want to mix in a wine we made last year to improve color and body (tasted great when we experimented). However, last year‚Äôs wine has gone through MLF completely and my new carbonic macerated wine has not (I want to release it now as a ‚Äúnouveau‚Äù). Would I have any trouble blending a MLF finished wine into it? Keep in mind the sulfite levels are checked and sufficient. Will K sorbate be necessary? Anyone have any resources or experience with this?",winemaking
Recommendations for books on commercial wine making,"Recommendations for books on commercial wine making I‚Äôve had a search though the sub and it mostly seems to be books on home winemaking. I‚Äôve been offered an ‚Äòapprenticeship‚Äô type role where I‚Äôll be doing 6 months with the viticulturalist and 6 months with the wine maker each year. The winery processes 5000-6000 tonnes of wine each year. Mostly sauv Blanc, a decent amount of Pinot Noir and a small amount of Pinot Gris which gets sent to another winery that deals with aromatics better anyway.

Having been a bartender for 10 years I really only have a theoretical view of what goes on, and there‚Äôs only so many YouTube videos out there about the running of the machinery. 

Wine science principals and applications gives me a lot to work with in terms of the viticulture side. But I‚Äôm wondering what I can read up on to learn more of the harvest/vintage side so I can get an in depth understanding of what I‚Äôll be doing during that time. (I imagine the first few years I‚Äôll basically just be a cellar hand attaching hoses, finding pumps, running the presses, doing punch downs, pump overs, cleaning etc). I guess machines vary somewhat from winery to winery so there‚Äôs no definitive guide, but if you know of anything feel free to send me in its direction.",winemaking

Is it normal that my wine is this 'muddy'? (First time Winemaking),"Is it normal that my wine is this 'muddy'? (First time Winemaking) Hey guys, just wondering if the color and cloudiness of this is of any concern? I have since bottled the wine after a secondary fermentation. Alcohol level is around 13%, its very sour but I like it. The color though  has turned most off that have seen it and there is a lot of sediment at the bottom of the bottles. All the grapes were thoroughly cleaned before being crushed, which I did through a cheese cloth bag, but the color was like this right from the beginning Thanks in advance!",winemaking
Question about the alcohol content,"Question about the alcohol content So this is my second year making wine from my natural growing concord vine in my back yard. Last year, the method was to let the must sit with the loose lid and agitating multiple times a day. This continued for the primary aerobic reaction. After about a week and most of the natural sugars had been consumed (but not sitting too long), I chaptized the batch to get the exact alcohol % I wanted (roughly 15%) and put the juice mixture into carboys for the anaerobic reaction. 3 months later, I had some delicious high proof concord wine with a final hydrometer reading exactly at 1.000. 

This worked great, and I still have some from that initial batch today. However, I'm now reading some websites (such as this one)[https://eckraus.com/wine-making-101/] saying that alcohol is produced during the aerobic stage? This doesn't make sense to me because everything I have read says that yeast when under aerobic conditions only multiplies but doesn't break down the proteins to actually make the alcohol, or at least very little by comparison to the secondary anaerobic stage. 

Can someone give me some clarity in this? I find it hard to believe considering the following.   

1) The sugar content of the grapes before hand would have put the wine at nearly 12% already without chaptizing it.   
2) There was no sugar left in the must after about a week of primary fermentation. So if there was alcohol, it would have been in the must.  
3) I put enough sugar to make the batch 15% alcohol for a finished product.  
4) The final reading was 1.000 meaning all sugar was consumed during the secondary fermentation.  
5) If there was alcohol produced in the first stage, the total alcohol would be WELL over 20% which the yeast is only rated to 15%.",winemaking

Ian Tattersall and Rob DeSalle Interview, Natural History of Wine 

American Museum of Natural History 

10 Scientific Discoveries of Wine and How They matter in Your Glass. 

A huge Punchdown shoutout to Ian Tattersall and Rob DeSalle, two men I‚Äôve spent dozens of hours with, but have never met.  I‚Äôm on my fourth read of their amazing book‚Äîwhich is far more narrative page turner than the title might imply.  The Natural History of Wine and Patrick McGovern‚Äôs ‚ÄòAncient Wine‚Äô influence my wine education beyond any two other works I‚Äôve consumed. 

Mr. Tattersall:  Give us a short introduction to your journey into science and what brought you to wine and the study of its natural history? 

Mr. DeSalle:  Tell us a bit about yourself, the American Museum of Natural History and why every American should visit your museum at least once in their lives. 

The focus of this interview is to connect the scientific understanding of wine to the daily enjoyment of it, which is also the focus of the first two chapters of your Book:  Vinous Roots and Why We Drink Wine. 

Ian:  Can you tell us a bit about the site, village and grape called ‚ÄòAreni‚Äô in Armenia?  There are older wine-production sites that have been confirmed, but are we just scratching the surface with Areni?

Rob:  An older site, Hajji Firuz Tepe, located in the West Azarbaijan province in north-western Iranand flanking the Zagros Mountains, believed to be the area where grapes were first domesticated (Patrick McGovern calls this the Noah Hypothesis) represents a mud-brick settlement from the late Neolithic, and is a village that would have been among the first settlements to use fired pottery. What is the significance of pottery/ceramic in the study of wine history, and are there ways to study the history of wine in a pre-ceramic Near-East/Transcaucasia? 

Follow up: Ceramic/Amphorae/Qvevri are all the rage in Italy, Napa Valley and even Santa Barbara in making traditional, rustic, and sometimes orange (macerated white). What do you believe connects the past with the present, and why are we going back to these ancient fermentation techniques when science and technology have given us jacketed, temperature controlled stainless steel? 

Ian: What aspects of classical Greco-Roman wine culture do you believe most impacts the way we drink and enjoy wine today? 

Rob: The ancient world always whispers to me: ‚ÄòYou are Lucky to Drink Modern Wine‚Äô. I have said in lectures that ancient wine would likely be oxidized and rustic to the point where most modern wine drinkers would have pause or reject it. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong. How do you think a modern wine drinker would react to the wines of ancient Areni, the Near East, Egypt, Greece or Rome? 

Enough with ancient wine history. Let‚Äôs talk monkeys and fermentation. 

Ian: When did fermentation of sugar via glycolysis (fermentation) first occur? Tell us a little about your view of how yeast evolved and why they produce the alcohol that we love so much? 

Rob: How are our fruit-eating primate ancestors responsible for human beings being able to drink fermented beverages relatively safely and commonly? Is our love of wine a reflection of an ancient ‚Äòmonkey mind‚Äô? 

Ian: In studying the chemical and atomic structure of wine and fermentation, what have you discovered that changes the way you look at and appreciate a glass of wine today? 

Rob: Tough question for a shorter interview, but can you lead us through a basic understanding of the evolution of vitis vinifera vinifera, the perfected, hermaphroditic vine that produces the greatest wines the world over? 

Ian: How do you imagine the earliest Chalcolithic vineyards were propagated and managed? Were they in the forests, were there trellised, layered from wild vines, created from cuttings, seeds? 

Rob: You mention in your book that biologists are most fascinated by sex and death. Even though I may favor thoughts of one over the other while I sip Champagne, how do sex and death impact the natural history of wine? 

Ian: I love how in Chapter Eight, the Reign of Terroir, you posit that the extremely violent birth and development of earth is responsible for many wine flavors that are born from place. How do we get from meteor menaces to mineral Montrachet? 

Rob: Choose one of the 5 senses and describe how your scientific knowledge of that sense changes the way you experience wine. 

Ian: Choose another sense and do the same! 

Rob: Urartu, Xenophon, Pliny, Democritus, Louis Pasteur, Emile Peynaud, Maynard Amerine have all described and changed the way the world sees wine. Wine technology, in this Brave New World, gives us massive stacks of research and science, mostly ignored by most makers of fine wine. Sure, we‚Äôre only 170 years past Pasteur‚Äôs first scientific understanding of germ theory and fermentation kinetics, but there seems to be a strong counter-enlightenment inherent in wine production, for the purpose of rusticity, authenticity or a reluctance to change ancient methods. What do you make of winemakers reluctant to heed research, and if you were a winemaker, what tact would you take? 

Ian: A climate-change denier might argue what we are seeing right now is a cyclical pattern‚Äîthe ancient Romans made wine in England, almost up to the Scottish border! But what we are seeing today is more rapid and measurable change as well as technology and vine varietals that can even the playing field and guarantee at least our generation, and perhaps a few more, will have beautiful expressive wine from the traditional viticultural areas we celebrate today. What might you expect from the wine industry in 2070, 50 years from now? 

Rob: Anything to add from your crystal ball of science, as to the future of vineyards and wines?

Did my plum wine oxidize?,"Did my plum wine oxidize? Last week I degassed my plum wine. I did this by shaking the fermentation bucket until the bubbling in the airlock stopped, then did a taste test to double check. 

The concept behind this way is that the fermentation has pushed out all of the oxygen through the airlock so no oxidization will occur as there's mostly CO2 left in the airspace. I've successfully done this before with a gooseberry wine, and this method was suggested by my father who used to make wine when he was younger.

However the morning after I noticed the color in the wine had changed from that peachy pink color to a brown-yellow color with only slight pale notes of pink left (like the color inside a plum). I decided to leave it for another week thinking it might need to settle after all the shaking. But today, one week later, the color is still the same. I did a taste test, and it does not taste particularly oxidized, but there has definately been a slight aromatic shift towards caramel instead of the mild floral notes from the K1-V1116 yeast (but maybe that might simply be because there is no CO2 affecting the flavour?).

I'm starting to seriously doubt my father's methods in winemaking by now (this is not the only time I've wondered if he used to do things properly back in the days).

Has the wine oxidized, or could it just have lost some of the color because of the clearing process?",winemaking

Possible unnoticed stuck fermentation?,"Possible unnoticed stuck fermentation? Hi all

So im making a batch of merlot, my first batch, and I wonder if I might have mistaken a stuck fermentation for the end of fermentation.  

The thing is that it was fairly warm for a few days when doing the ferment. Something like 75f/24c.  The fermentation was vigorous and I feel went quickly. Skins stopped rising and we decided to press and move it to a carboy 8 days after inoculating.  In the carboy it continued to produce gas for another week.  There were A LOT of lees so we racked it and moved on.  Then it seemed to taper off over another week and stop producing gas.   But at the same time the weather got a bit colder.   

&amp;#x200B;

So im looking back now and wondering... did it finish fermenting or did it actually stall?  its been about a month now and its no longer producing any gas and hasn't since after the second racking.   

&amp;#x200B;

What if it was just stalled?  Would I be able to add some starter and nutrients and see what happens?  Would that ruin the batch?  If its been stalled for a month is that going to ruin it?

Making Umeshu(Japanese Plum Wine) and having trouble sourcing ingredients this time of year,"Making Umeshu(Japanese Plum Wine) and having trouble sourcing ingredients this time of year Does this look too long and you don't want to read? Just read this: I'm trying to find green plums to make plum wine and I'd like some advice finding a source and/or opinions on the sources I have found in my rudimentary searches. Also, how high quality should plums for this project be? I've heard varying opinions.

Not sure if this is the right place since it isn't *exactly* fermented wine, but it is kept in a jar for an extended period of time to allow flavors to mingle, and it *is* called a wine in my language so I figure it might be worth making a post.

Basically, I'm trying to make some of this plum wine for my friend whose birthday will be in several months, as I know it's one of her favorite alchoholic drinks but she has trouble finding some at a decent price. So I think making a bottle or two of the stuff as a gift would be fairly thoughtful. I'm making it now and not in the season when the plums for this are typically available because A) the thought didn't occur to me until recently and B) if I were to wait, the wine probably wouldn't be done in time, as my understanding is it takes 6-12 months to do its thing properly.

The problem here is that the plums to make this are slightly unripe green plums, which I understand are available more in the range of may-july, not three months later in October. So I'm trying to see if I can find some out of season online. I've found a few sources that seem somewhat trustworthy on Etsy and Amazon, but I'd love feedback from other people who've done something similar on these sources so that I can try to find the best ones.

I'm also somewhat concerned as to whether or not this is even possible, as some sources tell me that the plums should be 100% free of blemishes, and others tell me it doesn't matter so long as the fruit isn't clearly rotting or severely over-ripe (which is my experience with other 'long-haul' projects like this).

[Amazon:](https://www.amazon.com/Tropical-Importers-Fresh-June-Plum/dp/B00APR2ZM4/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=fresh+green+plums&amp;qid=1602912869&amp;s=grocery&amp;sr=1-2) The most expensive of the bunch and also the most poorly reviewed.

Have I contaminated my batch?,"Have I contaminated my batch? To begin, this is my first batch. I'm using a concentrate wine kit, and at the time of incident I was adding the reserve and clearing agent before letting sit for 4 weeks. 

As I removed the airlock, I noticed the bung was stuck. No biggie I thought, it can't be that tight. So my dumb brain decides its an okay idea to use a plastic chopstick to wedge into the hole at an angle to pull it out. This chopstick had previously been washed with normal dish soap, but not sanitized.  (The only time I've slipped up on cleanliness). As you can imagine, it snapped a small piece into the wine. Feelsbadman. 

After freaking out, I use a cork opener to carefully insert at a straight angle, fitted it at a diagonal and pulled the bung out without any damage. After adding my reserve and clearing agent I refitted the gear (fully sanitized). 

My question is going to be a subjective one: am I fucked? What are the odds this plastic piece will ruin my batch? 

Not too concerned about flavor being ruined. Also should include that the SG was at 1.00 yesterday when I racked into the carboy. So If I'm not mistaken, there's still a wee bit of fermentation to take place.

Hi everyone! New to winemaking and have a question about sanitation,"Hi everyone! New to winemaking and have a question about sanitation 
What would be the general consensus on how sterile is sterile? I know that in the early stages of fermentation the wine is pretty protected by the yeast but when it comes to bottling how aseptic do I need to be?

Can I do it in my unfinished basement with the windows open? Or a clean room with an air filter and positive pressure?  Should I pressure cook my bottles? Do I need to dry the tubing and keep it in a sterile bag until I bottle or can I set it on my relatively clean workbench and not worry about particles in the air landing on it in the 10 minutes between sterilizing it and the actual bottling process?   Should I wear sterile gloves?

Finish red fermentation after pressing in carboys?,"Finish red fermentation after pressing in carboys? I started a red and ros√© fermentation right when the weather turned here in central Europe, so the fermentation has been extremely slow. After 2 weeks I‚Äôm currently around 50% sugar, and my target is 0. Last year I let it sit for 2.5 weeks and it turned out great... I was considering around 3 weeks this time.

The temperature of the facility (not heated) is around 10C these days. The guy running the facility is putting containers of hot water in the other‚Äôs fermentation tubs (once per day), and I reluctantly just started to as well. It did speed other people‚Äôs fermentations up, although since it‚Äôs not controlled, I wonder what the risks are of doing such? Anyone have experience with this method?

My main question is, should I just press after 3 weeks regardless of whether I reached my target sugar, and let it finish fermenting in the carboys? The ros√© is obviously doesn‚Äôt need pressing. Another issue is after 3 weeks, I won‚Äôt have daily access to the facility for punchdowns (more like every 3 days).

71B and H2S,"71B and H2S I recently used Lalvin 71b for the first time, in a strawberry wine (the berries were in the freezer since June).  I've read that 71B is a low sulfur producer, has low nutrient requirements, and generally is an easy-to-work-with yeast.  For me it's kicking out sulfur like it has Montrachet-envy.  I added ~1.5x the dose of nutrients (~1x+0.5x) and fermented in a pot covered with a loose-fitting lid (plenty of O2), so not sure what's the beef.  I didn't measure the pH for this one.  Fermentation was in the basement, which is ~19degC (66F) this time of year, so while I didn't track the temperature, I'd guess it was between 22 and 25 degC.

I sulfited the must, and waited 24h.  Then I sprinkled 1/3rd of the packet on top of the 6l of 19 Brix must and added 3.5g Tronozymol (manufacturer states 3g/5l).  Maybe skipping rehydration was a mistake, though usually a third of a packet sprinkled is plenty for small batches of medium-strength must.  It took over 24h to start, but 36h later it was kicking.  A day later I started smelling H2S, so I added a bit over a gram of Tronozymol.  That took care of the stink for maybe 6-12h, but it returned and I was reluctant to add more Tronozymol, since I don't know exactly what's in it and what's the safe limit.  I was out of DAP, so couldn't see if it would've helped.  Degassed normally (3x day) and let it go.  It got close to finishing in a few days, still stinking.  Now it's in a jug, pretty finished, and still stinking.  I'm planning to let the trub settle for a day or three and then rack and splash like crazy to try to get the stink out.

Anyway, has anyone else encountered lots of H2S with 71B, even when fermenting open and going well beyond the manufacturer's recommended nutrient dose?",winemaking

Question on flavour after fermenation has stopped,"Question on flavour after fermenation has stopped I picked and washed 12lbs of blackberries and started some blackberry wine about 6 weeks ago.  I moved it from primary fermentation (bucket) to secondary (3 gallon carbuoy), I was going to rack it again to clear it now that it seems fermentation has stopped.  I have a few questions/confirmations.

1) My hydrometer reading is basically at 0.99 (was hard to read but I assume that is correct?) I will measure again next week to confirm its the same, it was almost below the possible readings on the hydrometer.  Is that normal? I forgot to take an initial reading but I took one a week in and it was 1.04.

2) I have a full 3 gallon carbuoy and a 1 gallon filled 3 gallon carbuoy. Today I used the 1 gallon one to top up the 3 gallon one after fermentation as the neck went down a bit (first time I opened either one), and was going to just bottle the partially filled carbuoy to free up and clean the carbuoy tomorrow and rack the full one to remove sediment.  At this point I assume once racked, I just need to pop in a campden tablet and call it a day while it stores for 6 months with a sealed bung?

3) We tasted a bit from the 1/3 filled carbuoy and it was definitely alcohol but had a bit of a tart finish.  Is this tartness from the yeast/sediment, and will it dissipate after racking/ageing? I liked the dryness but was curious how to smooth it out a bit.

Elderberry Wine Recipe,"Elderberry Wine Recipe Long time lurker.  Looking to make another batch of wine (failed the first time).

I have been looking around at various recipes for elderberry wine and there seems to be a lot of variance on what to use to get the proper amount of sugar into the wine during the initial ferment.  I am trying to go for a full-bodied red that is a little on the dry side but has a little bit of sweetness, something like a cab maybe?  What I want most is for the elderberry to be distinguishable.

The other thing I have noticed is missing steps or duration for each step.

Is there anyone out there who can give me a recipe?

Grapefruit Wine Won't Ferment,"Grapefruit Wine Won't Ferment Looking for help / feedback. 

I'm making grapefruit wine according to some popular recipes on the internet. 6 grapefruits, gallon of water, 2.5lbs of sugar, etc. 

24 hours after putting in my campden tablets, and 12 hours after my depectenizer, I rehydrated K1-V116 exactly to the packets specifications. And then waited. No bubbles. After 24 hours of waiting I raised the heat in the house from 72 to 78, still nothing. 12 hours later I dumped in a packet of ICV-D47 hoping for something. It's about 6 hours later, and still have no movement. 

Before pitching more yeast I did another reading in the hydrometer. It had remained steady at about 1.088. I tasted it as well, and it didn't taste great. It tasted like grapefruit juice sitting on the counter for 3 days. It was delicious and refreshing when I first made the must, but now it's insipid and off. I know I added campden tablets, depectenizer, DAP, and yeast, so that may have affected the flavor? Still, I don't think it's going to make very good wine at this point. 

I'd like to throw it out and try again. But, I don't know where it went wrong. Here are my theories:

1. The yeast was bad? The yeast was not refrigerated. Maybe it got baked along the way? 
2. Too low pH. Grapefruit is very acidic. I don't have test strips so I can't tell, but I will be picking them up for the next batch. 
3. ???

Strawberry wine and back sweetening,"Strawberry wine and back sweetening Hi all,

My first 1 gallon batch of strawberry wine has just finished going through secondary. However, when I came to try it it's turned out a little too dry and tart for me, so I did some research online and found that I can back sweeten it with concentrated grape juice to help sweeten and bring out the taste of the strawberry without having them be swamped by another taste.

I've never back sweetened with concentrate before and was wondering if anyone could give me any tips on how much I'm likely to need, or if it is a case of adding for personal preference?

Also, this is probably a dumb question, but I couldn't see anywhere any indication of whether I need to dilute the concentrate or if I just add it as is to the wine.

That said, even if k-sorbate did have some bacteria or wild yeast on it, wouldn't those micro-organisms be prevented from reproducing at the recommended concentration of k-sorbate (roughly 100 ppm)?

Wine is oily during MLF,"Wine is oily during MLF Hi guys, 

A long time lurker, but this is my first post. I am making my first batch of Merlot from fresh grapes this year, and I came across a strange problem during MLF. The wine in barrel (225L Bordeaux French oak) stays a little oily and kind of ""dirty"". If I was to apply a tissue the wine clears, same if I pour it into glass. The barrel drunk 2 litres of wine and I topped it off. I wonder if it was oxygen that caused this? As part of my routine the first few days I stirred the wine every day for a minute. 

The wine itself looks dirty and a bit oily, rather than a white film on top. 

I have only added 10ppm of SO2 before the MLF, and the wine appears to be very vulnerable. pH is 3.38 (before MLF kicked in it was 3.31), and TA is 8.2 g/L. The Merlot must was 24.1 brix before primary. 

What I did is to top off the barrel fully (even some of the wine entered the airlock. Apart from that, is there anything I can do before MLF is complete, or should I wait for MLF, rack off, add Kmeta and hope for the best?

It is a large batch and I hope I get to rescue it.

Now I understand that this is definitely not ideal, but the real question is, could this be detrimental to the wine?

I'm London based and we get the occasional day of sun, however should I expect to leave these grapes untill 22+ Brix or is that unrealistic and I'll need to chaptalise to help reach a reasonable starting gravity. I don't mind adding a bit but to go from 14 Brix to a final alcohol of 12%-ish is going to be quite a lot of sugar added.

Has anyone else UK based started harvesting yet? And should I be leaving these alone for another few weeks?

Thanks!",winemaking

Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This year i went with 1,5t of Merlot in five different barrels, two black barrels i used **Fruit** enzyme and in the other three, i used **He Grand Cru**. At this moment i am on the 8th day of fermentation, and it started to slow down a bit, the smell is great and the color. I added 690g of yeast nutrition, half of it at the start and half of it after 5th day, and i added 20-25g per 100kg of Yeast.

*My question is: When should i Filter it from the must?*

I plan to leave it till the 11th day, and maybe 2 more days after the fermentation stops, but i heard several colleague winemakers from my city, they keep it 21 days (10 days while it ferments and 10-11 days when it stops).

But i am afraid that the ""dead"" yeast will f\*ck something up.

*What should i watch for? How long should i keep it with the must?*

I prepared inox barrels one 560l, other 200l, and one more 260l, i also have the Rover pump, so basically, i am ready, but i would like to keep it a bit more, so it gets all those juicy thingies from the must as much as it can.

Has anyone ever tried pressing grapes with a dutch cheese press?,Has anyone ever tried pressing grapes with a dutch cheese press? I am curious if anyone has tried it and how well it works if anyone has. I built a dutch cheese press and would hope it works instead of having to buy or build a standard fruit press. Mostly because of space and why would I want two things when when one can do the job for both things. For anyone who isn't familiar a dutch cheese press looks like this: [dutch cheese press](https://imgur.com/a/7zaRZ4u). In theory it seems like with the right amount of weight it should work and since the way the dutch cheese press works you can add a lot of weight along the lever. Any thoughts?,winemaking
Plum wine fermentation,"Plum wine fermentation Hello Winemakers.

This is my second year of making victoria plum wine from the produce of my tree in the back garden. This time, I fermented (2 vats as pictured) on the fruit for 4 days, then seived out and added extra sugar and it fermented quite nicely with the vats placed near the back of the fridge. After 10 days Vat ""Roy"" (white wine yeast) had stopped bubbling, and after 21 days (yesterday) Vat ""Moss"" (Active yeast) had ceased.

So, I have a question for you. How long can I leave them like this, if I were to move them somewhere cool like the garage? The reason I ask is that I can't get access to some of my carboys etc. for a while and I'm reluctant to buy some more if I don't have to.

I've started consulting for a few wineries and vineyards, and I've been surprised at the lack of knowledge regarding NEVER using chlorinated cleaners in production facilities and tasting rooms. It has made its way to the first question on my list when providing clients a free hour consultation.

Does anyone here have horror stories that they care to share in anticipation of COVID era Halloween?

When I was a young winemaker, I walked into the cellar of my employer, and got punched in the face with the smell of bleach. Active ferments, empty barrels, and palletized cases ready for cellaring were completely engulfed in a monstrous ball of chlorine gas. Following Toucan Sam's advice, I followed my nose to where I found a tasting room employee pouring a third bottle of drano into a clogged drain. I lost my shit on the poor, ignorant minion who was just following orders from an ignorant tastingroom manager; who was following orders from the owner of the winery. HR manager came to check out the commotion and found me mid-tirade and tried to yell me into submission. That didn't work because they learned quickly that the practice that they had been using to unclog drains was leading to the slow cancerous death sentence of their winery. I was a swearing wreckingball and no-one was safe. I got in contact with the owners, cursed them up and down for ruining the wines, and their business and promptly quit on the spot. 

A few years later, I found out from a friend that they hired a bunch of consultants to fix the mistake. Last I heard, the owners ended up building a separate production facility because 3 vintages of wine were suffering from TCA. They thought I had been a crazy exaggerating asshole, but it goes to show that you can't politely tell someone to not use Chlorine in their production facilities. I'd estimate hundreds of thousands of dollars in product, about 150 barrels, and an extra half million in new production area and wood. Next time you see chlorine; get angry.",winemaking

Diam corks for the win! The only issues I found, were cork related. Wines with natural cork, definitely were dried out more than anything else. Natural corks were the only ones that had a little bit of bleed. A few natural wines were the worrisome lots, as they seemed to push the corks a bit, but upon tasting, no issues were observed. Diam corks stayed in place, only dried a little bit, and were the first to stabilize once the temperature and humidity was corrected. In total, I only lost two bottles. They were from the same lot, and was a no sulfite natural white wine. 

Only more time will tell, but in the meantime, we'll keep drinking.

Requesting thoughts on Skeeter Pee early sample taste,"Requesting thoughts on Skeeter Pee early sample taste Is anyone familiar with how skeeter pee tastes right after fermentation completes? Please share your thoughts if you have tried this.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is some background to my question and by all means please ignore this if you want. I have for the most part followed the recipe at the end of this post with some variation, and now I realize there is an original recipe which varies from the one below. I started with 5.5 gallons in a primary bucket and Lalvin-ec1118 yeast and no fermentation happened initially. If I had to guess this was because of the k-metabisulfite in the lemon juice. After 5 days of no activity, I created another yeast starter and was able to get the fermentation going with no problem. I had the juice kept around 80-81 degrees Fahrenheit throughout fermentation. After 7 days of fermenting gravity is at .998 from the original 1.09. The starting ph was 2.95. Since fermentation seems to be complete or just about I racked into a carboy. I had extra for sampling and it seems to taste a bit like how nail polish smells. My plan is to let it clear and continue the recipe, but I'm curious what others with more experience may think. This is my third batch of wine and it has been a fun batch either way! I'm hoping this is not an acetic acid fault, but if I have to dump the batch at least it was cheap! Thanks in advance!!

The day after sealing it up and leaving it to ferment I could hear it bubbling away, the water in the airlock moved to one side and the lid started to protrude (dome over due to pressure if that makes sense!) But no actual bubbles in the airlock that I could see. 

Then the next day when I went to check it, it felt colder, the lid was back to normal and no sound of bubbles. 

It's been in our airing cupboard as I'm in the cold and wet UK so its the warmest place in the house. 

Any ideas whats happened? I'm thinking of checking it with a hydrometer but wanted to check first.

Advice needed :) - Four Week 5 Gal wine kit all in one bucket :s,"Advice needed :) - Four Week 5 Gal wine kit all in one bucket :s Kind of hoping this where some people sort of start off, so any experiences shared are appreciated!


What i know so far is my fermentation has gone fantastic, 5 gal wine kit in a brew-bucket, air lock etc etc 10 days in and starting to slow down.... once it hits the target SG im lost.


On purchase i was sold just one brew bucket with the wine kit, degassing and finings would all take place in the same bucket with no need to rack. 
Would take longer to clear due to sedement, but i have a filter so go straight from bucket to bottle in around 5-6 weeks. 


Youtube and instructions tell me not to clear wine in a bucket due to oxidation, glass or PET demijohn is needed, but dont specifically refer to shorter length wine kits. 

Long winded for a relatively short answer i know....

Do i risk ruining the wine by using one bucket, for the whole process over say 5-6 weeks including the clearing?

Is it worth racking a wine kit from one bucket to another just to get it off the sedement as next cheapest option?

If needed i was thinking a 5gal PET demijohn, its nearly the price of a 5gal wine kit round here and was never factored in, hence im after some suggestions :)",winemaking

I started fermenting my first-ever wine today. I am using three 64-oz growlers with rubber bungs and S-shaped airlocks. I did not use sulfites; instead I pasteurized the must and added the yeast after it had cooled down. The airlocks are already bubbling after half an hour which seems like a good sign. 


I'm just wondering what my next steps are. Can someone advise me on how long I should ferment? Should I be adding sugar or sulfites going forward?

Now I'm working with fruit meads using Lalvin 71B and what I'm reading online is that this *should* be racked a few days after fermentation starts to get it off the initial lees and avoid off flavors that 71B is known for.

Yeast Amount for Recipe in Blackberry Wine,"Yeast Amount for Recipe in Blackberry Wine First time making wine but we moved on to a property with a lot of fruit trees so here goes nothing.  Started a batch of blackberry wine following this recipe.  

[https://homebrewanswers.com/blackberry-wine-recipe/](https://homebrewanswers.com/blackberry-wine-recipe/)

This recipe is for 1 gallon, and I am making 3 gallons.  So I went through and tripled everything (12lbs of blackberries, 3 gallons of water, 3kg of sugar, 6tsp acid blend, 3tsp yeast nutrient, 3 campden tabs, 1.5tsp of pectic enzyme).  Hopefully that is all correct...

&amp;#x200B;

So far so good, will be adding the pectic enzyme today.  (So please stop me if a made some egregious mistake :) 

My question:  

The recipe calls for 1 sachet of Wine Yeast.  I have a 5g packet of Lalvin 71B which my local supplier recommended.  It says is is for 4.5L to 23L. 1-6 Gallon.  Do I still only need 1 sachet then?  Does the rest of the yeast just fail to make it?

Thanks in advance!  If you have any other tips and tricks about this recipe in particular would love to hear it.  The aim is for a dry wine in \~2 years time :)",winemaking

Decided to go for my first white ...,"Decided to go for my first white ... I've made many, many reds. For fun, I thought I'd get a white going this round ... in this case, a Riesling. I didn't realize it would require such a different setup!

First, I removed the inner panel/shelving from a dorm fridge door so I can fit a 6 gallon carboy inside. Alone, that was fine ... with an airlock, no so much. So I improvised a flexible airlock which is working out well!

Second, with a fridge like that, there is absolutely no way

1. To keep fairly tight temp tolerances
2. To keep temps up in the 50¬∞-59¬∞ F range.

So, I used a smart plug and smart thermometer to handle that! I started at 59¬∞F and I'll be getting it down to 51¬∞F slowly over the next few days. I mention in the vid that it's right around 60¬∞ ... but my viewing angle was bad ... the vid shows it's actually 58¬∞F.

I thought that there is definately a business here, as he has at least 1,000 true fans who would buy anything we sell.

He has an amazing story of overcoming near death experiences and helping people with vitiligo, which I believe would make a great wine backstory.

First timer here: My secondary fermentation is going really really slow,"First timer here: My secondary fermentation is going really really slow Used concord grapes. The recipe called for 1/2lb sugar per gallon and 1/2 juice + 1/2 water. Then another 1/2lb sugar at 2ndary fermentation.

\-12% initial (week 1)   
\-10% at start of secondary (week 2) \*after  sugar added  
\-7% week  3

We've made cider before, but we're going to attempt making wine for the first time. The concord grapes in the backyard are just about ready to harvest (planning on doing so on Thursday). However, the plant is fairly small. **If we end up getting a silly amount of fruit, can we top up the batch with grape juice and/or concentrate?** 

Nearly every concord grape thread I found on this subreddit linked to Jack Keller's recipes. Unfortunately, [the links](http://winemaking.jackkeller.net) don't work anymore. With some digging, I was able to find [this page](https://www.homebrewit.com/pages/concord-grape-wine-recipes), which is what I plan on following.

Second, I was able to acquire an insane amount of winemaking equipment through a friendly neighbor on a neighborhood forum (think $75 for $500 worth of carboys, a bottle tree, a crusher, a corker, etc.). **All of the stuff is super old‚Äîmeaning at least 20 years old. Am I correct in thinking I should just chuck out the campden tablets, acid mix, bentonite, etc.?** Or do those not expire? I've heard campden tablets are supposed to be pungent; these ones smell like the musty, old plastic bag they're in. I've also chucked out the bags of corks. I'm thinking they'll just crumble if we try to use them.

**Finally, please chuck any useful newbie-oriented resources my way.** The aforementioned winemaking equipment includes several older recipe and info books, and I've been looking through this forum, but I still feel a bit lost.

Experiences with Pet Nat,"Experiences with Pet Nat Has anyone experimented with pet nat? What did you do? How did it turn out? 

Background on this is that my family picked up a bit of chardonnay last weekend as a side project to our other winemaking. It was supposed to be at 23 brix, but it came in at 19.5. Our operation is pretty sophisticated as home wine making goes, but not enough that we have the set up for actual champagne, which would be the ideal lemonade to make from these particular lemons. 

 It's also interesting because we had some accidental pet nat this summer thanks to a stuck fermentation that stubbornly stayed right at just under 1% RS and then decided to restart after bottling, leading us to have to decant 14 cases of chardonnay and then rebottle. (gah. If we'd intended it, it would have been perfect, we had amazingly well entrained bubbles). Might as well try to do it on purpose this time, with the right bottles. 

However, there doesn't seem to be a lot out there on the internet on it from a home wine making perspective, so I'd love to hear about other's experiences.

* once done with step feeding, sum all the differences and

"apple wine ended quite dry, then spoiled when I tried to add spices (xpost to /r/homebrewing)","apple wine ended quite dry, then spoiled when I tried to add spices (xpost to /r/homebrewing) So I finally broke my cherry and had a brew go so bad that I ended up tossing the batch. It was a dead simple apple wine (literally just juice, sugar, premier cuvee yeast). It was salvageable at first, just way too dry. Then I decided to add some spices (vanilla extract, half a cinnamon stick and 2 whole cloves) during secondary. The brew developed some really off flavors and bitterness. So I'm wondering what I could do differently when I try again in order to prevent this. My first thought was to cook the cinnamon and clove into the simple syrup I made with the apple juice and sugar, then pull the whole spices out and just let primary fermentation take its course. I'm thinking that the actual pieces of cinnamon and clove started breaking down and adding a bitterness to my brew. As far as being too dry, I don't wanna campden tab it then backsweeten because my original intention was to prime it in the bottle and serve it sparkling, but a friend who brews for a living suggested nonfermentable sweeteners right in the primary, particularly brown sugar. He also suggested switching from premier cuvee yeast to US-05 Chico yeast. Does anyone have any experience with trying to sweeten sparkling wine or beer with nonfermentable sugars and/or brewing with spices? If so, does this seem like a reasonable plan? Would that yeast swap lower my ABV considerably (came it at 10.24% last time)?",winemaking
Newbie wine-making questions.,"Newbie wine-making questions. I'm new to making wine and I make small batches at home. With the amount of resources available online, I'm very confused at the moment. Here are some of my questions:


1. From what I understand, primary fermentation is the part where the yeast multiply and to be able to do this properly they need air. So we're not supposed to completely seal the container with an airlock (one-way air valve). But then again, without the seal and airlock, the wine is left open to contamination. How should I approach this?



2. Is yeast nutrient absolutely necessary?..even when I'm adding sugar to the mix?



3. What alternatives to commercially available yeast nutrient can I make myself at home?



4. I read online that one of the reasons we leave out the lees/sediments when racking into secondary is because the dead yeast can degrade and give an off-flavour to the wine. But yeast nutrient contains dead yeast. So... isn't the same as keeping the lees while transferring to secondary?",winemaking

[Fruit Wine] First time wannabee with a ton of questions,"[Fruit Wine] First time wannabee with a ton of questions Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've picked a bunch of raspberries and plums in my neighborhood and soon a ton of apples will also be available. I'd like to get started making fruit wine but after spending tens of hours researching, I still have A LOT OF (well 10) questions. I hope you guys can help me with a few of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if some of these have already been answered. If this is the case and you can provide me a link, I would be very grateful!

&amp;#x200B;

1) Is there a ""fruit wine bible""? 

\- Is anyone aware of a comprehensive book that will teach me everything?

&amp;#x200B;

2) How much fruit for how much water?

\- I have seen wild differences across recipes. My understanding is that the more fruit the better and if possible I should even not add any water at all. Is there anything I need to look out for or is more always better?

3) What's the deal with acid?

\- So say I've submerged my fruit in a minimal amount a water with Campden for 24h.

\- Next step I would check for acidity using a pH testing strip (not the most precise but more affordable). I would aim to be between 3.8 and 3.4. I can higher the acidity with wine acid or lemon juice and lower acidity with water.

\- Which acid should I choose (citric, lactic, tartic, a mix) and why does it matter? Also, what difference does it make if I'm at 3.4 or 3.8 (or even 3 vs 4)?

4) How much sugar and when?

\- Next I can take a gravity reading of the liquid and add the called-for sugar.

\- However, since I would also add pectic enzymes at that moment, my fruit will ""liquidate"" more. Is my initial gravity still accurate (or close enough that it doesn't matter)?

\- Second, say I've chosen a yeast with an alcohol tolerance of 14%. If I add the required amount of sugar, the fermentation will be complete and I will have a dry wine. I've read that fruit wine are recommended to be made sweet and not dry. Will I need to add sugar once fermentation is over or should I add more sugar to begin with? Does it matter?

5) Do I need tannins?

\- I have seen recipes calling for store-bought wine tannins, a big mug of very dark tea or nothing. I've read that tannins are important for the wine flavour but require longer aging. What do I need to know to figure out the kind and quantity of tannins I want to add?

6) How many times should I rack?

\- I've seen recipes with a single rack while others rack every 30 days for 6 months+. What do I need to understand to make my own decision?

7) Is bentonite useful?

\- I saw that it is use to ""clarify"" the wine. It's really not expensive so I figure I would use it. However, I don't see it mentioned very often in recipes. Does it actually bring any value?

8) What is sorbistat?

\- I know it is used to stabilize the wine when bottling and needs to be used in conjunction with Campden tablets. However, most recipes ignore this and just use Campden. Can sorbistat just be disregarded?

9) Can I age my wine in a carboy?

\- Most recipes just rack the wine from 1 carboy to another while fermentation is happening. Once fermentation has finished (verified by a gravity reading), they bottle the wine for aging. Can I age my wine directly in a carboy? It just seems to be a more practical storage vessel.

10) How long do I need to age the wine for?

\- Again, some recipes have the wine ready to drink in about 40 days while others recommend to wait 2 years. What does aging do? How do I know if the wine is ready? What should I expect?",winemaking

Finishing sweet?,"Finishing sweet? I understand backsweetening seems ro be the go-to option for end sweetness. But it seems like the easy way out. 

If you were to finish sweet, how would you go about it? What are the pros and cons?

I imagine you would want to ensure you use a low alcohol tolerance yeast and then ensure you add more sugar than they would be able to convert to alcohol. 

So say you had a start SG of 1.115 (for a potential abv of 15.6) and yeast that could survive say 12%, you would have some sugar left over after reaching 12% abv when the yeast would die off. 

This i think should leave about 238g of sugar in a 1 gallon batch. Thats aabout 17g per glass. Should be pretty sweet.",winemaking

&gt;-12oz sugar 

&gt;-about a liter of spring water

&gt;-1/4tsp tannins

Specific gravity was 1.06 qand ph 3.28. So took 12 grams of sugar and a little more honey and simmered with water before adding to the must. This gave me a sg of 1.94

So then checked the ph again and used potassium bicarb to bring it to 3.52. 

Then i topl 125ml water and warmed it up  and added 6g of Goferm and the yeast, let it mellow a few minutes and pitched it.

I'm an experienced home brewer and know that pulling green beer isn't always the best but there's something it can tell you.

The peach wine I pulled is kinda funky. Borderline offensive. SO says it smells like a Creamsicle that got left out in the sun... I'm hoping it's just off gassing something. I'll let it sit for a minute and see if that goes away.

The taste is VERY DRY and VERY LIGHT. It doesn't taste sour at all, good thing right. Despite there being like 50 Peaches in the 5 gallons. I also threw a mango and a kiwi in there... Because I had them. 

It also did not look odd in the primary. 

I made a smaller batch first. Let it ferment. Racked it 2 weeks later and decided to rack that onto fresh must, with the potassium metabisulfate and yeast nutrient mix plus another champagne yeast packet.

It fermented like crazy. Left it for 2 weeks. Just racked it again a bit ago into a clean carboy.

A warning: Butterfly pea blossom tea,"A warning: Butterfly pea blossom tea So I've brewed a lot of wine in my time, and the standard fruit wine has become boring, so I decided to experiment with butterfly pea blossom tea as a way of both colouring the wine and giving it some body.

For those of you who aren't aware of this, it's a flower that is bright blue when brewed with pH neutral water, but turns purple when an acid is added to it. I was trying to make a bright purple berry wine.

I have just come round to the idea of boiling fruits rather than mashing them, as I still don't have a fruit press.

So I decided to boil up these fruits with some butterfly pea blossom tea. The colour was amazing, it was like crystal royal purple! Very happy. I did my brew, put it down to ferment and washed my equipment.

7 days later someone offered me nearly 3kg of banana. Perfect for a 5 litre batch of banana wine, and although plain at this point, 5 litre is 5 litre. Grabbed my brewing kettle and started boiling the banana and noticed something weird. The water was turning grey, almost like aluminium.

I decided to ignore this and put the boiled fruit and juice in a bucket overnight with some pectic enzymes and some campden tablets. I'm sure after boiling for 30 minutes, I'd kill any extra bacteria or yeast but better safe than sorry.

The next day, the banana water mixture was still gray but no off flavours at all, pure banana water. The OG was far to low so I decided to add some sugar and boil it again. This time there was this weird flouting matter at the top that was the same colour as the water. I started skimming it off and suddenly the water underneath was a darkish yellow, much as you'd expect from banana wine!

Turns out that the pectic enzymes and the boiling bought all the loose butterfly pea blossom particulates to the top! Guess I didn't wash it out as well as I had thought.

Tldr; if you use butterfly pea blossom in your boiled brew, make sure to thoroughly wash the pot, and boil a full pot of water before your next brew, or you could end up with some very bad colourations.",winemaking

1. How easy/difficult/messy is the process of disgorging?

2. How necessary is disgorging? I know that, historically, champagne actually used to be served a bit cloudy, and some producers of p√©tillant naturel don‚Äôt bother with this, but will leaving the lees have any detrimental effects over time? Is there a way to leave yeast in the bottle but reduce the amount of lees produced?

3. The methods I‚Äôve read about for making sparkling wine at home consist of either fermenting in the bottle or forcing carbonation like soda; are there other methods out there?

"Help with cranberry wine, repeated stuck fermentation","Help with cranberry wine, repeated stuck fermentation Good afternoon all,

I started with a preservative free 100% cranberry juice. I used 2 qts of juice and 2 qts of water plus a couple lbs of dextrose (corn sugar) and 2 tsp DAP/Urea. Very vigorous fermentation for 4 days as you would expect of a primary. SG was around 1.092. Tasted after a week...very very sweet. I don't have the gravity written down but I think it was maybe 1.078-ish. Tons of sugar left. I waited 2 more weeks...very little bubbling and not appreciable change in sg. I added more DAP/Urea and got very vigorous fermentation for a week and then just a trickle. I left it for 6-weeks. It is still sweet and very very yeasty/rotten fruit tasting. SG is lower...less sugar, but it is stuck again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something about cranberry that it needs so much DAP? I don't mind adding more, but I have already used 4 tsp in a 1-gallon batch which is almost what I would usually use for a 5-gallon batch of something like blackberry. Please advise.

There are no signs of infection.

Do you use airlocks when bulk aging?,"Do you use airlocks when bulk aging? Hi!

I have had my wine in primary and secondary already and as I have multiple fruit wines getting ready at different times, I want to bulk age them a few months in glass carboys and then blend and backsweeten etc.
But when I clear it and add potassium sorbate before racking the wine into the carboy, the wine is already ready for bottling. 
If the wine is not doing anything, can I just keep it in a closed vessel, either a carboy, plastic canister or even those bag-in-boxes and when I want to bottle, just transfer from those to the wine bottle?

And also, other topic, but if I want to try to make some of those into sparkling wines, should I add the sorbate at all?
I bought a separate champagne yeast for that so maybe it‚Äôs safer to stabilize all the wine?

But when should I bottle this? Right now or is it okay to bottle sparkling wine with new yeast and sugar also after 3-4 months of bulk aging?",winemaking

I'd appreciate some insight from anyone with the patience to help a total newbie! I've never looked into making wine before. I have very little basis of knowledge beyond the basic wine classes I took as a server. My husband bought way more peaches than we could use, so on a whim I looked up a peach brandy recipe (that is, of course, actually just a peach wine since there's no distilling involved) and bought a few gallon fermenting jars.

I made it last night. I peeked at it a few times today and realized I have no idea what I'm looking for, so it could be going great or horribly wrong and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I figured I should probably find the winemaking sub and look around. Holy crap. Skimming a few posts, I am so lost. I don't have any tools beyond my fermenting jars. I didn't use any special wine-making ingredients or additives. I used about 3 quarts of peaches cut into probably 8-10 wedges each, skin on, pits included per the recipe. 4lbs of sugar, tap water, and dry active yeast that I keep for bread making. The recipe said to layer the ingredients and didn't mention stirring in the first stage. It said to check on it after a week, stir, and repeat for four weeks, and then it's done. 

Okay, well, I do have some slow bubbling (a blub every 30 seconds or so) and obvious foaming, but everything is separated into layers. Should I intervene and stir it in until the sugar dissolves? I've looked around at a few works-in-progress and none of them look like mine.

Popping my Homebrew cherry,"Popping my Homebrew cherry Popping my Homebrew cherry

Hey reddit, posting my first two attempts at home brewing here. 


1) Blackberry and Muscadine Wine....
Okay I know this is an odd mixture but I had my first year of harvest from my blackberries, and still needed some weight in fruit for a one gallon batch. My brother just moved into a house in which the previous owner was growing muscadine grapes so I thought ‚ÄúPerfect, more home grown fruit for free.‚Äù Purely an experiment and using it as my first try to get down the basics
I did the standard must with fruit, sugar, water, and I even made a trip down to my local brew shop and bought some pectic enzyme because I was feeling spunky.
It is currently in its first few hours of primary fermentation, more to come.

2) Clover Honey Mead
I had an extra carboy and airlock from my original equipment order so I decided why not. I got some pretty standard honey from the market and mixed it with the water at about 3lbs to the gallon. My plan is to do a mocha mead later on in secondary fermentation by adding whole beans and cocoa nibs. 
This is my total mess-around-and-see-what-happens jug of mead

Notes:
Yeast: Lalvin Bourgovin RC-212
I did use Starsan to sterilize all my equipment since that is what most information sources stressed the most.

I will be posting updates so you can either join in my celebration or laugh at my jugs of vinegar. Take care, and good luck in whatever brews you have going.",winemaking

Carbonating and canning Ros√©,"Carbonating and canning Ros√© TLDR: should I add sulfites and force carbonate or skip them and re-ferment with priming sugar in the can?

Long version: I‚Äôve been making beer for about 15 years, but recently I decided to try my first wine. I bought a Winexpert Grenache Ros√© kit (I only got an OG of 1.060‚Ä¶no idea why, seems way too low‚Ä¶ and the Lalvin 71B packet was old and hard‚Ä¶so I saw no signs of fermentation for over 2 days and ended up buying a fresh packet from the homebrew store‚Ä¶I probably will never buy a kit from this company in the future but‚Ä¶I digress..) and it‚Äôs now, finally bubbling away.

I‚Äôm making this because I enjoy drinking a canned sparkling Ros√© (Underwood is the brand) on mountain climbing trips up here in Alaska. I recently bought a can seamer from my beer, and thought I‚Äôd try to do it with a wine.

I‚Äôve been using priming sugar with my beers and re-fermenting in the can.

However, the late dosing of sulfites in wine gives me pause. What would be the best way to do this? A) Add the sulfites, condition, then re-add more yeast at canning along with priming sugar or B) don‚Äôt add the sulfites at all and prime in the can with sugar just like a beer.

Or, should I just rack the wine into a keg, force carbonate, then can from the keg and be done with it?

Does this recipe sound relatively ok?,"Does this recipe sound relatively ok? First time making wine. Planning on a 1 gallon batch of blackberry-raspberry wine. Heres what i'm planning on using:

-3 lb blackberries/2lb raspberries (total 5lb fruit)

-sugar as needed for a starting specific gravity around 1.95

-pectic enzyme the break down fruit, acid blend to bring to ph to 3.2 to 3.5, metabisulphate to clean fruit and equitment; bentonite to clear

I'll mash the fruit with pectic enzyme and let rest for 12 hours. 

Add fruit/sugar/water/metabisulfate to the primary fermenter and rest for 24 hours to kill bacteria/wild yeast. 

Add the yeast after the 24 hours and let it do its thing for around 5 days till specific gravity is 1.03. 

Transfer to secondary fermentor and ferment for about 3 weeks till 1.00 sg. 

When its 1.00sg, i'll rehydrate bentonite and add about 2 tbsp and rest for around 4 days and then rack into bottles. 

Does this sound ok? Am I missing anything or is there something I could do better?

"Used too much water in plum wine must. Can I use jam to ""thicken'"" it up?","Used too much water in plum wine must. Can I use jam to ""thicken'"" it up? So long story short, I made 2 batches of plum wine: one with wild yeast, one with cultured red wine yeast.

For the first one, I barely used any water, SG was around 1.040 before I added some honey.

However, for the 2nd one, I wasn't thinking straight, and I added some warm water to thaw the plums, then I added some more water with the pectic enzyme, then even more water with the yeast starter. So much so, that the SG here was only 1.020 before the honey. This 2nd batch even had less plum (per weight) as the 1st one. So I'm kinda worried that I diluted it too much.

On the bright side, we have some homemade plum jam from the same trees, so I'd be able to use the same plums; question is, is it okay to use jam for this? Or did, let's say, the boiling of the jam added something to it that wouldn't be pleasant for a wine? Or will it actually make it less diluted? Thanks!",winemaking

Mixing wild yeast with cultured yeast in plum wine?,"Mixing wild yeast with cultured yeast in plum wine? Might be a stupid question, but it's the first time I'm making wine.

Wild yeast wasn't a choice here, but the must tasted really good so I kept going with that, hoping the yeast would die off at around 4-5% alcohol. I  kept adding honey, and now, if my calculations are right, it's around 8.5% and the wild yeast is still vigorous, and eats up everything **rapidly**... it might even be able to go up to 14%. However, I still want to use the cultured yeast, as I know  for sure that it would help with malolactic fermentation, which I  desperately need (my plums has 3x more malic acid than regular plums...  pH was close to 2... but now it's better, thanks to calcium carbonate).  

So, if I made another batch (with cultured yeast), could I just siphon this somewhat-fermented must (with the wild yeast) into my new batch? Like 25% every third day. 

My cultured yeast is a ""killer yeast"", but the wild yeast could also be just beer yeast (US-05, which is kind of a beast) that got stuck on the wall from my previous batches. That would also explain why it's it's so vigorous and rapid with the honey I've added to it. Anyway, it (apparently) has a high alcohol tolerance, and I definitely would not want to go as high where I could risk the health of my cultured yeast. Any ideas? Thanks!",winemaking

dealing with oak chips,"dealing with oak chips So, i want to oak in my carboy because it is way easier to get all the air out with the narrow neck compared to the wide mouth of my primary fermenter.  the problem is, to get the chips out i would like to be able to scoop them off the top before racking once it is done.  however, with the narrow opening that isnt really practical.

This is my first time oaking with chips, so there are a few ways i imagine this going down, and i do not know which is true:

1) no problem at all.  the chips just float and do not get in the way of racking.

2) make some kind of tube to hold the chips in, with little holes drilled.

3) make an oaked concentrate by pulling a gallon out and super oaking the gallon, then adding it back in to the 6 gallon bulk. (this i could easily pour through a colander at the end)

I've also purchased a bunch of different wine kits. RJ spagnols, and Eclipse kits mostly. I've liked everything I've made so far, except the red wines. I've made some pretty good white wines from kits, but the red usually either taste bland or they smell a bit off.

The last two kits I made were the eclipse stag's leap merlot, and the Lodi Cab. Both of them had a faint to mild ester smell. The wrong kind of fruity smelly. Not all together off putting, but nothing something I would want to produce again. Generally the red I've made from kits taste like really cheap, slightly sweet (FG was at 1) 5-6 dollar value wines at the liquor store. 

I've generally used the provided yeast, EC1118, and follow the kit instructions. They ferment in the basement, it is usually in the mid 60's for temp. They all get bulk aged, and I've waited at least a year to drink any of them. I have one near year 4 that is still pretty meh tasting. 

So, is this how all the red kits turn out? Or am I a failure? Anyone have any tips to get better?

I have another unused red kit I received as a gift to give this one more shot. There is really only so many bottles of cooking wine I can make before throwing in the towel.",winemaking

My wine stopped at 1.003g/L and not at the expected 0.990g/L that I've learned is the rough common ending point for wine fermentations. At first I thought the fermentation had gone stuck because of too little nutrients left or something, but then me and my dad did a taste test, and it tasted dry, like a fully fermented wine would. My OG was 1.085g/L, and seems to have settled at 1.003g/L as if there is no sugar left to ferment, which I find confusing.

Winemaking techniques for sweetening,"Winemaking techniques for sweetening Hi everyone

I personally like to make my wine on the dryer side but I do recognize that people have different tastes and may desire a sweeter wine.  My question is more to gauge how to do this without adding straight sugar. 

I‚Äôve heard of backsweetening with wine conditioner or simple syrups but I was hoping there was more of a ‚Äònatural‚Äô technique towards doing so? Stopping fermentation early was always a thought to preserve more taste and sweetness but then you‚Äôre left with a lower alcohol content.  Maybe what I‚Äôm asking isn‚Äôt really possible but I was hoping to gain some other experiences if people had any.

Kit with grape skins ABV question,"Kit with grape skins ABV question Starting off a WE Eclipse Cab/Zin blend with grape skins, and as I tested the initial SG per the instructions, I had a question: is there a better time to test for initial SG than immediately after adding the skins? I would think that the bag of skins adds quite a bit of fermentable sugars, but they wouldn‚Äôt be immediately added to the must and so wouldn‚Äôt be measured when you take that first SG reading (kit instructions have you add the skins, take SG reading, and then immediately pitch the yeast). 

My thinking is that by doing exactly as the instructions say, you will end up with a lower ABV calculation than is actually present in the wine because of the additional sugars from the skins; I don‚Äôt know how big a difference that would actually make, since the bag of skins is about 1L volume compared to 16 or 17 for the juice bag, but it‚Äôs gotta make some difference, yeah?",winemaking

Wine stopped at 1.003g/L but I want to go further,"Wine stopped at 1.003g/L but I want to go further I aimed for my wine to ferment out all the sugar all the way down to roughly 0.990g/L like you normally reach by the end of second fermentation.

The wine has been sitting at 16C in a dark cellar, with the proper amount of sulfites and the needed nutrients added at the start of the fermentation, sitting at pH 3.8 just a few days prior.

Should I grab a packet of EC-1118 yeast to finish off the rest, or is there something else that I can try first?

Question on land for vinyard/orchard,"Question on land for vinyard/orchard Hi folks.  For many years I've been dreaming about moving out of the neighborhood we currently live in and out to a decent size chunk of land that we could plant a vineyard and an orchard on.  I realize that doing both of these will be costly ventures and that they will take time to start producing usable fruit.  One of the things Im concerned about is property taxes on the land.  I live in MN and the property taxes are rather high.  I currently pay almost 8k a year just for the half acre house and lot we live in which is in a pretty rural area.  That said, I've been looking into the agricultural homestead tax break that's available and that farmers typically use.  I imagine that an orchard or a vineyard would fall into the bucket of what's considered agricultural, but when I called the assessor he told me that for the ag homestead you need to have 10 acres of land that was ""producing"".  My concern is that the land we're looking at currently is just a field (they are leasing it currently to some government CRP program so the property is already ag homesteaded but we would cancel that if we bought it).  For us to be able to plant 10 acres will take Im guessing a least a year or two.  And even after that, we wont be ""producing"" fruit for quite awhile.

Does anyone have experience with how this might work?  I have another call with the assessor next week where Im going to ask some more questions.  For instance, Im not sure if we need to be producing a product and selling it (we wanted to start small and likely not go commercial right away even once we were making fruit) to qualify for ag homestead.  And if so - do they expect us to show receipts or something each year to keep the classification?

If anyone has dealt with this and has an insight I'd appreciate it.  The property Im looking at currently has very reasonable property taxes because of ag homestead but if we bought it and lost that classification I think it would be extremely expensive.",winemaking

I might have messed my very first wine... could use some help...,"I might have messed my very first wine... could use some help... So, this is my first time ever making a wine. We have about 970 plum trees, so I decided to make plum wine from the ""leftovers"" we kept for personal use. For my batch I used about 20Kg (44 lbs) of absolutely beautiful, ripe, perfect plums (ƒçaƒçanska lepotica).

First day, I took them out from the freezer, put them in my fermenter bucket, and added some luke warm water and campden tablets. Second day I added pectic enzyme, but instructions said 'wait 24hrs before pitching yeast'. At that time I already aerated the must because I wanted to pitch my yeast, but I thought, whatever I will pitch tomorrow... 

Today, when I went out to check the bucket, I saw it fermenting VIGOROUSLY. Or at least that's what I think. I cannot imagine pectic enzyme being this vigorous after 20-22hrs... When I aerated it, I probably 'helped' it get some wild yeast infection.

Being in panic, I immediately dropped in some more campden tablets. I could have pitched my yeast, as it is supposed to kill wild yeast, but it was bubbling and foaming so wildly, that I was afraid that my packed yeasty couldn't kill that much wild ones (or let alone get acclimated and start multiplying...) 

I brewed quite a few beers before, and never had any problems. But boiling and the hops also help to disinfection, so...  
Was that the right decision to add campden now? Or should've I added my yeast on top of the wild yeast?  
I'd appreciate any inputs.... cheers",winemaking

Wine left sitting because of Covid19 lockdown. Best way to check current dissolved SO2 levels?,"Wine left sitting because of Covid19 lockdown. Best way to check current dissolved SO2 levels? I made 60 litres of wine and was a week a way from bottling when Ireland went into full lockdown. So instead of aging in glass bottles, it sat in plastic bottling buckets for what's been now a few months.

I had put in the recommended level of sulfides just before the lockdown began but on account of the plastic being somewhat permeable I'm concerned that some of the free SO2 has been used up.

The wine is a big Malbec so I had intended to let it sit in bottles for possibly 1-3 years. From what I've read, I believe the wine should last in a bottle for about a year with the amount of sulfides I had already applied, but I'd like to be on the safe side and confirm it in a somewhat scientific manner.

I've seen instruments listed online for about 20 euro that say they can measure the dissolved SO2, but I've always seen paper strips as well. What's the recommended tool? I'm happy enough to spend 20-30 euro, but not interested in say a 100 euro instrument (unless it can do more than just SO2).

Just used a fruit press for the first time,"Just used a fruit press for the first time I just wanted to share my recent experience. 

I have a batch of cherry wine that I started  on the 18th, and I needed to move out of primary into secondary. just as a little bit of background. my process is normally to start the ferment in a bucket, then after 7-10 days transfer it to a 6.5 gal carboy for 1-2 weeks, then rack into a 6 gal. carboy to let it age. 

Now, I've had a run of bad luck with transferring from the bucket to the carboy, as the fruit seems to clog the siphon and I need to keep cleaning it out, or that I have to strain the leftover pulp to get the last bit of juice. Now I've spent more then a few hours with fruit in a metal strainer and a spoon mashing the last few drops of wine I could from the mash, and I swear I'm never making another batch of fruit wine every time I do it. However recently I got a 5 gal fruit press in that I was going to use to make cider. I wasn't going to use it at first, as i thought it was going to be overkill, and cherry wine shouldn't clog the siphon to much right...

Well after 20 minutes and 2 gallons of wine siphoned out, I decided to give it a shot. I cleaned the press with some one step and starsan, slowly poured the wine/must into the press (making sure to overload the sides only once), and started tightening down. 

Y'all, I love this fruit press so much. I was able to press out a full 6 gallons of wine from the fruit, and normally I'd be scooping the must and mashing it in a strainer for an hour to get what I got in 15 minutes. That and cleaning it up was a breeze. 

I don't know why I didn't order one sooner (well I do know, it was a little over $100 to get, that's why), but it's a game changer. It's one of those quality of life upgrades that will make my life a lot easier.

Some finer points of bottling from portless stainless fermenter ...,"Some finer points of bottling from portless stainless fermenter ... So ... I have a 12 gallon portless, stainless fermenter filled with Pinot Noir.  I am going to attempt bottling.

In short, I am sanitizing the bottles, and then using a bottle filler and a racking cane (and some tubing) and siphoning the wine  into the bottles, then corking.

Seems simple enough ... some random questions, though ...

\- Do I do a final sulfuring before bottling ?  Or put any sulfur into the bottle itself ?

\- Does anyone sanitize bottles with boiling water instead of starsan, etc. ?  Seems like a lot of work to fill and then properly rinse all the bottles - if I boiled water, I just do the rinsing step ...

\- Are there measuring bottle fillers ... like, they let 750ml pass and they auto stop ?  Or do I just need to eyeball the neck of the bottle and try to get the level right ?

\- Does anyone dump CO2 into the bottles prior to filling to avoid air contact while filling and to make the tiny headspace in the bottle oxygen free ?

Finally ... I am not going to bottle all of it - I am going to bottle half (unoaked) and then throw some oak cubes into the remaining wine and age it with the cubes for another month or three ... and then bottle it  Just for comparison.

"Peach wine stopped fermenting after 5 days, any advise?","Peach wine stopped fermenting after 5 days, any advise? Here is a [photo](https://i.imgur.com/0RffnlL.jpg).

Hi there! I've been lurking on this sub since I started making my own wine about 3 months ago. Last week I started my new project, a peach wine, but now after five days the fermentation seems to have gotten stuck. I'm hoping anyone on here might know what went wrong or how I can try to fix it.

This is the recipe I used and the steps I followed. Last week Thursday I started with 3 kg of peaches. I mashed them up, added 1 liter water, pecto enzymes and a little snuff of sulfite (about 0.1 g). I let the mixture sit in a fermentation bucket overnight, covered by a cheesecloth. Next day I squeezed out the juice and ended up with 3 liters of peach juice. I did my measurements and found out the juice had a sugar level of 1040 (84 g per liter). I decided I wanted an alcohol level of 11% in my wine, and I wanted to make 5 liter, so calculated that I needed 5x11x18 = 990 g sugar in my wine. I already had 3 x 84 = 252 grams of sugar present from the 3 liter peach juice. I also already had 262 from the yeast starter I made that day (the yeast dissolved in white grape juice with some added sugar to get it started). So I calculated that I still needed to add 990 - (262+252) = 476 g sugar. I already had 1 liter of fluid from the yeast starter, so I heated an extra 0.75 liter water and dissolved the 476 g of sugar in the water. Once it cooled down I added 5 grams of yeast nutrient and mixed. I added the sugar water to the peach juice and mixed. Then I added the liter of yeast starter to the juice and mixed. I put it all in a demijohn bottle and sealed it with a waterlock. It started fermenting already within a couple of hours and the next morning it had gone absolutely berzerk! The wine (to be) was squirting out of the waterlock sometimes against the ceiling even! I moved the demijohn to a saver place where it wouldn't stain the ceiling and left it there. After two days of this extreme fermenting it calmed down to a normal (from what I've seen so far) level. However it kept slowing bit by bit from then on and this morning there were no more bubbles coming through the waterlock and fermentation seems to have stopped almost fully... 

I guess it's good to mention that I did clean all my equipment thoroughly with a sulfite/acid mixture and then rinsed with water after cleaning.

This is the first wine I'm making where I've done all the measurements myself in stead of relying on someone's recipe telling me how much sugar to add, so I'm kind of worried I messed up there somehow. Also I'm thinking I may have added too much yeast. I used a full package which said it would be enough for 10-20 liter wine, but I used it to make only 5 liter. However I tried googling this and found that it shouldn't be a problem most times. 

I'm really hoping anyone on here has a clue of what might've happened and how I could try to fix it. Any advise would be appreciated so much! Thank you in advance.

DB oxidized in primary?,"DB oxidized in primary? Hey y‚Äôall I‚Äôm making this:

As a 5 gallon batch. Today my SG is down to 0.990 and my temp is at 73.0. I‚Äôve been consistently losing about 0.010 SG/day and the color has been gorgeous. 

Today, however, it looked ruddy and sad. Not the beautiful ruby I had been seeing. 

I‚Äôll admit yesterday I didn‚Äôt end up stirring or temp checking because I had a run in with a wild cat and ended up in the ER for rabies shots and wound care! (Whoops, but life happens).

Should I dump it? Oaked on peg board,"Should I dump it? Oaked on peg board TL;DR: wine got peg board pulp in it. Should I dump?

So I just went to filter my wine with my buon vino when I noticed something in the top of the carboy. My wife had been doing a job in my tool room / winery a 4-5 weeks back and had cut a whole in the peg board I have on the wall. Looks like some of the peg board pulp somehow ended up in the top of the carboy. She said the airlock had fallen off but she put it back on right away. Maybe, maybe not. Regardless, there was a layer of pulp in the very top of the neck of the carboy. 

I had already prepared my clean carboy and wine filter so I filtered from under the pulp. No noticeable smell. The peg board basically looks like cardboard but I am concerned about the glue that could have been in it. 

According to wikipedia peg board article, ""Standard perforated hardboard is made of wood fibers, usually with the addition of resin, and tempered by coating with a thin layer of linseed oil and baking at a high temperature to polymerize the oil"". My concern would mainly be with whatever is in the resin.",winemaking
Flowers of wine troubleshooting,"Flowers of wine troubleshooting I'm making peach country wine and noticed some white ""snowflake"" bits on the surface of some of the peaches at the top. Through research, I've realized these are flowers of wine. Because I'm not using anything but fruit, sugar and water to make wine ([here's the recipe](https://www.milkwood.net/2014/03/24/how-to-make-wild-fermented-young-country-wine-its-easy/)), how should I go about removing the flora? Do I need to remove it?

Here's the process I used for this wine:

1. Sanitized the container and utensils with white vinegar and warm water
2. Dissolved sugar into warm water and poured into gallon sized wide mouth mason jar
3. Topped with sliced fruit
4. Covered jar with cheesecloth for 2 days (until bubbles were actively forming). Agitated jar \~3x/day to prevent fruit at the top from drying out
5. Replaced cheesecloth with airlock lid on day 3. Still agitated 3x/day
6. Plan to bottle when desired dryness is achieved

After day 4, I noticed white specks on the top fruit.

Calculating ABV when adding sugar and water,"Calculating ABV when adding sugar and water Hi all,

I know this topic has been touched here before but most posts what I found were talking about adding sugar but not water.

So I started making wine from fruits/berries from a recipe which tells me to add 2kg of sugar to berries, top it off with water until 25L, pitch the yeast and let it ferment for 5 days.

Then rack the wine from the solids and add more sugar and water. Amount of sugar here depends on the specific recipes for specific berries/fruit, anywhere from 2 to 4kg.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I did with my strawberry wine, was I added 4kg of sugar to \~10kg of berries and topped it off with water. OG was 1.110. So now I've let it ferment for more than 5 days, it's still bubbling strong, and yesterday the SG was 1.007 which makes about 13.5%. It tasted still very sweet and quite strong, almost like a strawberry liqueur. 

So now I'm planning to rack the wine off the berries, but then I need to add more water to get back to 25L and I probably need to add more sugar so it wouldn't be diluted very much. 

But how could I calculate how much sugar I need? If I dilute it with water, the SG goes down right, but not past 1.000. So if I add sugar and it goes over 1.007 again, does that mean that my ABV will rise over 13.5%? I actually thought about targeting 11.5% so is this viable still? May it mean that I only have to add water and no sugar, depending on the amount of wine I'm left after racking?

&amp;#x200B;

And also, another way around, I am also planning on pitching yeast to my rhubarb wine today (I cut up 7kg of rhubarb, added 4kg of sugar, topped it off with water to 25L (\~6.5 gal) and added potassium carbonate to neutralise the oxalic acid and added potassium metabisulfite to kill the wild yeast and bacteria). But the OG was only 1.057, which would result in 7.5%-8.8% depending on which dryness I want. But I want this to also end up near 11.5%, so I thought about also adding sugar after \~1-2 weeks of fermentation and racking. But the problem is the same, how much sugar?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I measure the SG before racking, then rack and add the water and then measure the SG again? But I don't know what to do with that then. I do know that \~16-20g of sugar per 1 litre will add about 1% of ABV but I don't know how much water dilutes it. 

&amp;#x200B;

One way I thought how to do this was to add water to plain fruit, measure OG and then calculate how much sugar I need in total.. but that probably doesn't help because the amount of water I need to reach 25L is different if I need to add 3kg of sugar or 6kg of sugar. So 5L water on berries gives a different result than 10L water on berries. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I don't know what's the best way to plan for this and eventually calculate it.",winemaking

Question about sugar.,"Question about sugar. Normally when I make a batch, I will use table sugar to bump my starting specific gravity. However last semester I learned that yeast can really only eat glucose efficiently and has a hard time eating fructose. This would explain some issues with over sweetness in past batches since table sugar(sucrose) is glucose and fructose bonded together. So I'm curious what would be the best solution for this. Should I just source my sugar strictly from the fruit, is there pure glucose options, and/or should I do what beer makers do and break down starches (barley, oat, ect) with amylase via sprouting? Additionally, what are some methods that you all employ to raise your specific gravity?",winemaking

I do have someone who can deliver the wine (bottled) to me by car, about Labor Day. So what‚Äôs the best thing to do to save this wine? My options are:

Transfer the wine as-is in carboys, and wait a few months after the move to bottle (i.e. let it ‚Äúrecover‚Äù from all the motion)
Bottle it now and transport it that way, and hope it recovers from all the motion
Bottle it now and have my person deliver it to me on Labor Day, when it may have had enough time to rest in the bottle before moving.

Please accept my invitation to a non-commercial presentation of a pre-harvest check-in and Q&amp;A with two veteran winemakers with more than 60 harvests between them.

Here's some questions I plan to pose to David, and if you have others, please post them in comments:

Welcome, David! Let‚Äôs put something in our glass and have a chat! 

The focus of this show will be mostly Q&amp;A for beginning and small production winemakers, but first let‚Äôs understand your history. Give us a bit of background on your journey into wine.

First question that came in: How important is it for a home winemaker to plant, grow and harvest their own grapes?

Commercial Vineyards are an amazing source of value fruit right now, fruit has never been cheaper. When you go into a vineyard to check vines and fruit, what‚Äôs your protocol from when you get out of your car until you leave the vineyard? Take notes? Photos? Testing?

If you were talking to your vineyard manager, where you purchase fruit, and are describing picking, sorting and delivery protocol, what would you request/demand.

What has your experience taught you about pulling the trigger on a vineyard for harvest.

You‚Äôre making 1000 lb lot of Pinot Noir from Sierra Madre Vineyard in Santa Maria‚Äîlooking to get a barrel and some topping wine. The fruit comes in on a warm day, fruit temp is 85 degrees, and otherwise pretty sound with a small amount of bird damage, less than 2%. Pop quiz hotshot‚Ä¶..take us through how you make this wine, and for fun, let‚Äôs assume you only have advanced home winemaking equipment.

How should a small production winemaker keep their barrels, carboys and other containers of aging wine safe and sound?

Measured the SG and it was 1.100. 24 hours for the campden to dissipate, then added the yeast. Within a day it was fermenting rapidly, went for a couple of days, and then seemed to stop. I planned to let it go for 2 weeks in primary, but since I didn‚Äôt see any activity I though fermentation must have stopped and would need to be restarted, but I checked the SG and it measured at 0.994. Total fermentation time was about 5 days to reach that point, which shocked me based on every kit I‚Äôve ever done. Does this seem normal/acceptable? It‚Äôs hard for me to judge if anything is off based on the smell since I‚Äôve never done peach before, but it smells basically like peaches and yeast to me.",winemaking
A little help with my cherry wine please,"A little help with my cherry wine please Hi all

This has been my first time making wine, so I‚Äôm very new to the process. Please excuse me if I sound like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing, because I basically don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve passed the point of pouring my wine through a cheese cloth and discarded the fruit. My wine is now in another container with an one way valve on the top, but I‚Äôm not seeing any bubbles like I‚Äôm expecting. 

My method has been to add about 5 punnets of cherries, sugar and boiling water. Waited for it to cool and added pectolace followed by campden tablets a few hours later. After a couple of days I added my yeast and yeast nutrient. Then let that sit for a week, then stained out the fruit and sealed it up. Everything I‚Äôve read says I should be seeing it bubble away, but I‚Äôm not doing. My initial gravity reading was 1.100, but I‚Äôve not done any more since.

My only thought, other than doing something wrong, is that there‚Äôs only a small amount of wine in quite a large container. So I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm not seeing anything because of the massive air space maybe?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any help or ideas, thank you!",winemaking

False Bottom(ish) for Marchisio 200 L Variable Capacity Tank,"False Bottom(ish) for Marchisio 200 L Variable Capacity Tank Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone would have a suggestion for something similar to a false bottom for a Marchisio 200 L variable fermenter. I planned on putting my grapes in the fermenter and allowing them to ferment on the skins initially. My hope was to then allow free flowing fermented juice to come out the spigot at the bottom with the hope of it being fairly clean. Then I could press the rest. I typically just ferment in a large plastic barrel, strain out the juice, and then press the skins for more. 

I thought about posting in the Homebrewing  sub for this, but since it‚Äôs technically a wine fermenter and it will be for wine I figured I‚Äôd throw my question here.

Wine tasting a bit acidic,"Wine tasting a bit acidic Hi! I have a question. I have tried to make wine twice and both times the wine has tasted a bit acidic, almost vinegar. The first time I understand it because I tried to do it without the minimum equipment required. but this second time I did it in a much more controlled environment. The process was as follows: I crushed the grapes by hand, I left them for a week with the must and stirred it twice daily. Then, filtered and put in a carboy with a balloon as an airlock (bought a real one airlock but it's on transit). It started to ferment and make some bubbles, that's how it was for one more week (I didn't make that much wine, a liter) and yesterday I saw that it no longer bubbled, so I decided to transfer it to a bottle but not before drinking a little to taste it and it has an acid taste.

Learned a really cool trick this weekend...,"Learned a really cool trick this weekend... Three weeks ago, when my buddy and me moved our blueberry wine out of primary fermentation into secondary, we wound up with an ""extra"" gallon that didn't fit into our 5 gallon carboy.  

We racked off the extra gallon into a single gallon jug and decided to ""experiment"".  Turns out my buddy had some lightly toasted oak cubes and a vanilla bean left over from a previous project.  

Fast forward two weeks (last weekend), when we went to bottle the wine, we tested the ""control"" (5 gallon) and compared it to the ""experiment"" (1 gallon)--night and day difference!  The change was so drastic we decided to alter the 5 gallons to the same flavor of the one gallon jug.  

While it might have set us back bottling by two-three weeks, I am ALWAYS going to pull off a gallon in the future to experiment with ""tweaks"" to the flavor!",winemaking

Oh boy... I may have gone and f@&amp;$%d up.,"Oh boy... I may have gone and f@&amp;$%d up. Long story short, I may have ruined my first attempt at making wine this afternoon. I was transferring out of primary, into a 5 gal carboy for secondary. Everything went smooth, more or less. Until it came time to stopper it up. The bung wouldn't stay in the mouth, with or without the airlock in it. No matter what, it just kept sliding up and breaking the seal. I tried maybe a little too hard once without the airlock in, and, well..... the bung sorta pushed through the mouth and fell down in. Like, all the way in. 

Obviously I've bought the wrong bungs. I did, fortunately by two of them. I've temporarily duct taped (Merikuh!) the second bung in place and installed the airlock. I'm fairly sure every surface of the bung was sterile, as my hands were still sterile.

My questions are:

1. Will this ruin the wine if the bung is left in? Its black raspberry, and nearly finished fermenting, so it will only be there for a few days (hopefully)

And

2. How the hell do I even go about retrieving the damned thing? Empty or full, I'm struggling to think of a way to get it out.

Orange cranberry wine got a fly in side the fermenter.,"Orange cranberry wine got a fly in side the fermenter. I made 2 gallons of 14% abv Orange cranberry wine using store bought juices. (Grape juice, orange juice, and cranberry juice). It took about 2 and a half weeks to finish fermenting.

 I decided to rack the product from the 2 gallon fermentation bucket over to 1 gallon carboy today. 

But unfortunately I've had an terrible fly issue in the house lately and haven't been able to get rid of all of them yet. So when I check my airlock after fermentation is over I see there are quite a few flies in there.

I got worried so I changed out the airlock and opened the bucket to make sure no flies got into the wine and at the time I didn't see any. It smelled pretty normal (like a young wine should, slightly fruity with sharp young wine smells and a strong sent of alcohol).

After I finished racking the wine I was left with about 1 and a half gallons. Unfortunately I saw 1 fly in the carboy that somehow managed to get in and i have no idea if it was during fermentation or while racking earlier today. 

So I followed by tasting the wine to make sure it was ok and it tasted pretty normal. (I've made this wine before).

But just to be sure I added a campden tablet to the carboys and started seconday fermentation as normal.

Do you think the wine will be ok? I really dont want this to start turning into vinegar or something.

Sourcing grapes/Labrusca varietals,"Sourcing grapes/Labrusca varietals I'm relatively new to brewing and winemaking (started earlier this year), and up to this point I've made mostly meads and just recently got the musts for some fruit wines started. I've thought about trying my hand with actual winemaking grapes, and I'm particularly interested in making wine from grapes native to the Americas - mainly Catawba but also other Labrusca varieties like Traminette, Concord, and Niagara, possibly even muscadine grapes if they're available. What I've seen online so far is really only relevant for obtaining European varietals in quantities that I would never be able to practically work with. Has anybody had luck getting these types, or does anyone have advice on how to search for them?

Fruit Wine Questions,"Fruit Wine Questions So, after working with meads and an experiment with coffee wine, I started to try my hand with fruit wines today ‚Äì and realized I don‚Äôt really know my stuff. I prepped two gallons tonight, one with 4lbs (U.S.) of black cherries and the other with about 4lbs of blueberries. I mashed each batch of fruit (and pitted the cherries) to get the juices and pulp, added a bit of water to get to about 3 quarts (that meant adding maybe one quart to each), and then added syrup to bring the gravity of each to 1.090.

For the first (possible) issue, the blueberry must wound up fairly viscous; there‚Äôs definitely liquid juice, but there‚Äôs also a decent amount of pulp and the liquid itself seems almost syrupy. Is this normal for blueberry must, or did I use too much fruit for a one-gallon batch?

Then, for both wines, I put the musts into glass carboys which were all I had on hand, along with the pulp and skins. Should I be expecting any issues to result from this other than that the carboys will be difficult to clean out? At the moment there‚Äôs fruit in each in contact with the surface which I figured would settle to the bottom, but if it doesn‚Äôt then would this be at risk for developing mold or infections? It also occurred to me that part of the space within the carboys is taken up by solids that obviously won‚Äôt get into the final bottles, and lo and behold at least one source online told me to use primary fermenters slightly larger than my intended batch size to account for that; should I be expecting a significant difference, would it be worth it to buy 2-gallon buckets and transfer the contents from the carboys into those, or is this a trivial issue?

And finally, if you have any advice for a hapless vintner feel free to leave it. I went into this particular project fairly confidently and have left it feeling like I know less than when I started.",winemaking

Ingredients order question,"Ingredients order question Hello.

I was gifted one of those DIY brew-in-abag wine boxes from a friend.  The instructions seem fairly straight forward, nevertheless I still managed to make an error.  After 11 days of fermentation it said to do the following:

1) Add the packet of Sulfate/Sorbate, tighten the cap, shake the bag, loosen the cap to let the air escape, repeat 5 times.

2) Add the packet of Kieselsol.  Tighten the cap, shake it, loosen the cap.  Wait one hour.  

3) Add the packet of Chitosan, tighten the cap, shake, loosen cap.  Re-tighten cap and leave undisturbed for 5 days.

Well, I went and added the Chitosan first before the other 2 steps.  So I decided to just throw all of the other packs in ( sulfate and kieselsol) and did the 5-times shake/losen routine.

Will this turn out fine or was that hour long rest supposed to do something mega-important? 

Also, I make beer from grain regularly in which fermentation temperatures are quite important. Is there an ideal temperature range for fermenting red wine?  The instructions on this didn‚Äôt indicate, but I have another box if this to do later.

How critical is full sanitization of equipment in winemaking?,"How critical is full sanitization of equipment in winemaking? Coming from the world of beermaking, sanitizing equipment and sterilizing the wort is of paramount importance, and everything needs to be maintained sterile, and the only microbiology should be the one you deliberately add yourself as the fermentation agent.

Going to winemaking however, I feel for me it all gets a little blurry. Sure you should keep the equipment clean, but you are still adding a bunch of fruits/berries containing the natural microbial flora(/fauna?) and mashing them up and then keeping them at bay with the proper concentration of sulfites, therefore focusing activity on the added yeast. With that in mind, do you really need to use foodgrade sanitizers on everything, or is it enough to quickly clean the equipment? I'm thinking that if the sulfite concentration can prevent an infection from the fruits/berries, it should then be pretty good too at preventing an infection from a cleaned but not sterilized spatula for instance.

Will this ruin my wine as is or will I be fine? If not, when should I pitch the yeast, as my wine making book told me to add my pectic enzyme, yeast nutrient, and sugar when I added my k meta. Would agitating the liquid help, as in stirring it with a wooden spoon to get rid of the free sulfur help, or no?

Edit: used a sanitized turkey baster to soak up the juice and then i squeezed it back out on the wall of the buceket a hundred fifty times to release any unbound sulfur, and stirred for around thirty minutes. Nonetheless, I will be reconsidering pitching the yeast in twenty four hours in favor of around thirty hours. I also did not smell or taste any significant sulfur in the juice before or after, which I think means it wasn't as bad as I thought.",winemaking

Woods for aging,"Woods for aging Hi all,

I have unlimited free access to silver maple, hard maple, red oak, poplar, live oak, and cedar. I have very little access to white oak...the one most frequently use when aging wine and spirits. 

Can you share resources, experiences, and thoughts on the use of these alternative woods in wine aging? I believe cedar to be both too aromatic and slightly toxic, but what about the maples and the red oak? Poplar? Live oak?

If no one has experimented with these...something I find a little hard to believe, then I can do experiments and post here about it. But if would be great if someone has an article or blog post about doing the experiment and could share it. 

I suspect live oak has way way way too much tannin for aging wine. I wonder if the same is true for the red oak. I think poplar and hard maple might be too low in tannin and sugar and that poplar will have a tendency to disintegrate in the wine. Silver maple probably has a poor flavor profile, low sugar, low tannin, and also disintegrates. 

Please share whatever thoughts and resources. 

Thanks all

How to try before I buy?,"How to try before I buy? Hi all, I've been following this subreddit for a while now and am very intrigued.  I'd really like to get into winemaking.   I love learning and creating and the satisfaction of mastering new skills and reaping the rewards.  Beekeeping, gardening, making Kombucha, woodworking, electronics, etc.  I think making my own wine and also cheese are on the shortlist of next challenges.

But getting started with winemaking seems like it comes with a fair amount of risk.  I love a nice Cabernet but my tastes for wine are really rather diverse.  That said I've never had a home made wine.  And frankly I have had some fruit wines from a local orchard which really did not float my boat.    I would hate to launch myself into this and not appreciate the end product.

How can I sample some home made wines that I could reasonably expect to recreate myself?  Both grapes and other fruit wines that a beginner could master with some effort.  I'd like to know that the rewards of my next adventure will be worth the time and money.

Any suggestions?

Dandelion Wine questions - flavor before secondary/bottling,"Dandelion Wine questions - flavor before secondary/bottling I've done beer in the past, not much for wine.  I'm trying a dandelion wine and a lilac wine right now.

-Dandelion Wine:

OG: 1.116 (I did a bad job of temp correcting, I thought it was 1.1 originally)

Gravity where it seems finished, 3 weeks in: 1.01

-Lilac wine:

OG: 1.096

Gravity now, 2 weeks in: 1.01 also.  Still fermenting more.

Lalvin 1116 yeast in both (I'm recalling that off the top of my head... It's that really common one people like)

---

So the dandelion wine is still a bit sweet.  I think I got up towards the max alcohol of this yeast.  It's in a secondary now, I hear I should leave it there for 2-3 months before bottling.  That sweetness seems good and fine to me, I don't mind that.  

But I'm wondering - how ""good"" should dandelion wine taste at this stage?  I'm tasting the bit from the hydrometer tube, and while there's a good aspect to it I also sense some sour, some kind of vapory aspect.  How do I know if I've kept it sanitized properly?  

And honestly, I used a ton of petals but I can't say I taste a lot of difference between the dandelion and lilac wines.  I don't feel super confident I've created flavor beyond the raisins and bit of citrus.  

I guess I don't perfectly know what my questions are, I just wonder how normal any of this sounds to you.  Thanks.",winemaking

So you'd want your storage container to be a similar material, obviously.  But what about the hose leading to the spray nozzle?  Usually that's a much different plastic.  And the sprayer nozzle itself maybe.

Now they are in the corner with a terrible odor and probably bugs. 

Is there a way to completely wash and sanitize the buckets and maybe save them? I'm almost convinced that even bleach wont even kill the bacteria that accumulated in the buckets for this much time and I don't want to do another fermentation unless I can find something to ultra sanitise them.

"Seeking technical and prescriptive books/articles on the roles and use of tannins, sorbates, and other additives.","Seeking technical and prescriptive books/articles on the roles and use of tannins, sorbates, and other additives. I have been making homemade wine from kits for a long time &gt;10 years. Sometimes I make wine from fruit concentrates too, but I have never made a true ""from scratch"" wine. I have always been intimidated by things like Ph, tannins, additives, sulfites, sorbates and the like. I usually just do what the kit says and roll with it. 

That said, I really want to get comfortable with experimenting and making some from-scratch wine, but most of the guides I have found so far just say ""add this much of this thing"" with no explanation beyond ""it brings out more blah blah flavors"". I want to understand what is actually happening with the different yeasts, the effect of PH, how long metabisulfites last/persist in the wine, how sorbate works and how important is it really, and what are tannins actually doing to create flavor. In short, I want not just a recipe but an understanding of the chemical and physical changes that each step makes to create flavors.

My guess is I need a book, or a collection of books. I would rather not seek a Ph.D in chemistry to learn this stuff. I also guess that ""Winemaking for Dummies"" isn't the best go-to source of technical and prescriptive information. 

What have you read that was technical in nature but also accessible enough to drive decision making when creating homemade wines? Academic articles would be great if there is such a thing for winemaking. Well-respected books are, of course, appreciated.

FYI, I have family members who claim to react poorly to both sulfites and sorbates, so how necessary they are and what they do (in detail) is important to me. I take great steps to avoid their use.

Elderflower wine tasteless?,"Elderflower wine tasteless? A couple of weeks ago I followed a basic elderflower wine / sparkling wine recipe which I planned to ferment in PET bottles. (First brewing I've ever done).

I ended up adding a proper yeast and nutrient, and they're now in demijohns/carboys with airlocks and I've got some basic equipment. (7 litres of wine in two 4.5 litre demijohns.)

They're more or less finished fermenting now, I measured the specific gravity today at 0.996 and took the opportunity to do a quick taste test.

Fair to say it doesn't taste of much, presumably because the original recipe didn't include grape juice, raisins, or tannins so it's purely relying on the elderflower.

Old Muscadine Grapevine Just Trimmed by Landscaping Crew - Is there anything I should do? [Texas],"Old Muscadine Grapevine Just Trimmed by Landscaping Crew - Is there anything I should do? [Texas] tl;dr I inherited a neglected wild grape vine that grew into/through my back fence (chainlink). The neighboring property became a huge construction site, and a crew came in and cut most of what was hanging on the opposite side. Is there anything I should do to help the chances of it surviving the Texas summer? Is it doomed regardless? Will it survive regardless?

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

Recently purchased a house in the fall of last year and it turns out that all the dead vines on the back fence are Muscadine grapes! I got really excited to try to tame it at the end of the season and to try to make wine for the first time. I have no pretensions about the wine probably turning out bad, but I was excited just to try. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a few months ago, the forest behind my house gets demolished to make way for a neighborhood. Fast forward to today, the sound of chainsaws startles me out of my bed, and I run out just in time to save all the half-ripe grapes from the other side of the fence and beg the crew not to cut through anything that looks especially thick.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the deed is done what can I do (if anything) to help the vine survive until next year? And while I'm here, any tips for handling the purple but not-quite-ready grapes as far as wine making? I realize everything about this post is probably a shitshow, but don't roast me too hard. Thanks!

Removing yeast from homemade wine.,"Removing yeast from homemade wine. Hello everyone, 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I recently got into making homemade wine and have currently made 15 gallons of wine.  We absolutely love it!  There is one issue though.  We are finding that after 4 weeks we are happy with the turn out of the wine's sweetness and flavor, however, we are still making alcohol.  I am not sure the alcohol content due to never using a hydrometer, however, I do know it is much more potent than what we normally purchase at the store (11%).  I am not shooting to make a 20 percent wine, I am completely fine with it after one month and we have repeated this process 3 times now with all great results.  After one month the wine is still making alcohol and I have no idea how to stop this.  I am currently trying the chill method and then racking the wine without pulling up the yeast from the bottom, however, I am concerned that I may still pull some residual out and the wine will continue to produce alcohol.  So far from the research that I have done the only true way to ensure that no more alcohol will be made would be to remove the yeast.  I can not find a fairly priced filtering system for home made wine making and I would like to know if anyone has any suggestions, have ever had my same problem and came up with another solution?

First time making berry wine - how do I make it round and smooth?,"First time making berry wine - how do I make it round and smooth? Me and my dad are going to make some sweet wine with fruits and berries from the garden. He's a seasoned home-winemaker and have made plentiful of sweet berry wines. They're very good and flavourful, though I've always found them a little unpleasant too since they never turn out very round and smooth, and I often get a headache from them (sometimes even an unexpected hangover). For me this is my first time. I have experience in brewing other drinks like Kvass and Tepache, but no experience in winemaking - so my plan is to make good use of my dad's knowledge, but I also turn to you people to hopefully learn something from here so I can make some wines that are also smooth.

One wine will be 90% gooseberry, 10% plum (for extra depth), and spiced with elderflowers. Another one will be 100% blackcurrant. I have no problem in waiting for the wines to age, wether it being a few months in a vessel and/or a few years in the bottle. So far my method to make it a tad smoother is to aim for a slightly lower ABV (12% instead of 13.5-14%) and also pay close attention to what gravity tastes the best when sweetening the wine before bottling, and then age first for a few months in a fermentation bucket, and then in the bottle for maybe 2-3 years.

I have used bentonite to clarify wine in the past but only after completion of both primary and secondary fermentation...about 2 weeks of each. I add the bentonite when I rack the 3rd time for aging and by the time I bottle it is clear...even polished. I have always been happy with the bentonite's performance but now I want to try something different and get your input.

I don't want to bother aging this fruit wine. I didn't add oak or anything and this is a first foray into fruit wines for me...everything else has been grapes or honey.

Like I said, usually I would wait until I rack the wine the 3rd time to add bentonite and more or less forget about it for a couple months. What do you think?

I know some people add bentonite at the start of primary fermentation but I have never tried it, does this method for clarifying work OK? In case you ware wondering about isinglass or gelatin, there are people in my family with dietary restrictions so I don't use those.

Thanks for your input, I really appreciate it.

Fruit wine sweetness,"Fruit wine sweetness Hi guys,

Kit wine: what does bottle sediment taste like?,"Kit wine: what does bottle sediment taste like? What does super fine sediment in the bottle taste like? This is a sauvignon blanc.

Made a WinExpert kit a few months ago and just tried a glass after sitting in bottle for 2 months. Bottle is perfectly clear with super find sediment at bottle (didn't filter). The first glass poured completely clear and tasted very good, exactly as I would expect based on a sample from the bottling bucket.

An hour later I poured another glass and the taste seemed completely different. There was a slightly harsh almost alkaline, slightly bitter taste at the finish that wasn't there in the first glass. It poured clear and there was barely any perceptible sediment stirred up in the bottle after the first glass. 

What might cause this difference between the first and second glass? Does the sediment have a flavor and will even trace amounts be noticeable? I added sulfites before bottling but the solution was completely diluted before mixing so I wouldn't expect the sediment to contain any solid bits of that. The sediment appears to be yeast and a marginal amount of fining sediment.

The berries were mashed with a potato masher and have risen up into a thick cake above the liquid. It looks ok (no apparent mold/bacterial growth) but I'm concerned about this batch. Last year I used essentially the same recipe but with only pureed strawberries. Last year, it fermented vigorously in primary for 2 to 3 weeks and for about a month at least in secondary). This year, it seems to be fermenting slowly but perhaps I just can't hear the vigorous bubbling below the fruit layer on top. What do you think I should do? If the specific gravity is similar to the original sg (1.058 i think) should I repitch and keep in primary?

Also, i had 15 lbs of frozen pureed peaches and am making dessert wine out of that too. The start sg rated off the scale (1.062 i think) to result in a very sweet wine (very similar to my strawberry wine last year) and it is fermenting just like the pureed strawberry must from last year.

Need help figuring out if I did anything wrong with peach wine,"Need help figuring out if I did anything wrong with peach wine 	I recently racked my peach wine I have had from primary to secondary and tried a taste of it. To me, it tastes off in a way I can't quite put my finger on  (though I'm not sure what a peach wine is supposed to taste like). It definitely tastes like it has alcohol in it, kind of peachy I guess but it doesn't taste like wine. My girlfriend says its kind of like a cider and my brother says it tastes like yeast and peaches. It's smelled real good this whole time and fermented fine so I really suprised how peculiar it tastes. Anyway, here's my recipe if any of you can find anything that would be wrong. This is my third time fermenting and my first time with using fruit pulp.
- 5 lbs of peaches (4 lbs after pairing)
- 28 cups water
 - 4 lbs of sugar (+added 2 cups to get must to 1.1 specific grav)
- boiled dead baking yeast (for yeast nutrient)
- 1.5 tbsp of lemon juice
- 1 pack Lavlin ICV-D47 yeast
Making must:
	clean and pare away pits and bruises from peaches. Mash peaches in a bowl. dissolve sugar in water and add the lemon juice and peach mash (pulp tied up in a cheese cloth). Place the mixture the basement to covered in a brew bucket overnight. Next evening, prepare the D47 yeast and boil a pack of baking yeast for 15 minutes. Add both to the mixture and stir well. Add in sugar in quarter cups until must is at 1.1 specific gravity (~13% potential) (ended up being 2 cups). 
Primary fermentation:
	Stir the must once a day for 5 or so minutes. sits at about 65-66oF. Sits in a modified 5 gallon water jug (cut the top off so its more of a bucket now) and is covered with a cheese cloth. Let it sit in primary until 1.02 specific grav (took about 9 days or so). 
Remarks:
	The must seemed to ferment just fine. It didn't seem too weak or too aggressive. Bubbling was really steady. It started to bubble the next day just like my other wines with D47 have done. I was scared that I added too much sugar initially, but the yeast seemed to be pretty happy the whole time and didn't act sluggish. before racking day, I measured 1.021 sp.gr. I waited until the next day where its about 1.011 sp.gr. This is my first time brewing by sp. gr. so I don't know if I let that get too low or not. Currently the wine is sitting in my secondary fermentation bottles and are happily and steadily bubbling away. Oh and any tips on how to easily separate the must from the pulp when you rack would be appreciated. That was a bear. 
	Any help anyone can offer would be much appreciated. I think winemaking is really satisfying and I'm always proud to drink and show off the wines I make to people.",winemaking

I have been racking it about once every two weeks in the hopes that removing the wine off of the film (lees?) at the bottom will lessen the yeast smell. Is this the right approach? Is that too often for racking?

Should I try that aeration racking (sorry, I don‚Äôt remember the proper name) to remove the smell? That seems counterintuitive to everything else I have read about preventing aeration as much as possible while racking.

How long should I age in the carboy before bottling? The instructions in the kit say to bottle right away, but just about everyone here and in other sources say to age for 6 months or more.

What do you do if bentonite does not clear your wine?,"What do you do if bentonite does not clear your wine? I made a gallon of tripple berry wine and it has just finished secondary fermentation. 

It was time to clear the wine so I added about 1tsp of bentonite to 1 cup of warm water and mixed everything together. I waited about an hour for the bentonite to rehydrate and then I pitched it into my wine.

The wine still had sediment at the bottom after secondary fermentation was finished but I didn't think much of it and just proceeded to add the bentonite mixture.

After adding the mixture I shook the wine vessel as best as I could to incorporate everything and waited 24 hours. 

After 24 hours the wine is still hazy and now I have even more sediment at the bottom!

What can I do to fix this issue. I would hate to waste the wine. The fruit was very expensive!",winemaking

Can you mess up secondary by adding to much additional wine and water?,"Can you mess up secondary by adding to much additional wine and water? Hey guys, first time wine maker here and I have a possible novice question.

I am making a gallon blackberry, raspberry, blueberry wine. I just transferred to secondary earlier today and looking back I might have messed up. I guess I miscalculated how much juice would be extracted from the berries because I ended with a little over a gallon and a half of wine to transfer into secondary. 

I wasn't prepared for this so I didn't have anything to put a half gallon of wine into so I put it in my other gallon carboy. Since it didn't fill it up I added a bottle of white wine I had in the fridge (which brought it to under 3/4 full) then topped it off with cold water. Checking in on them now. The original gallon is showing fermentation action and the other isn't.

Did I completely ruin that second gallon? Should I give it more time to try and recover on it's own? Should/can I add a bit more yeast and sugar to kick start everything again?

Pineapple beer (wine?),"Pineapple beer (wine?) Hello everybody!

I know the title consists of the word ""beer"" but I believe this fermentation process is something wine makers could relate better with.

Due to COVID-19, the sales of alcohol have been banned in South Africa. Therefore people are purchasing bakers yeast and pineapple to make there own.
 https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-to-make-your-own-homebrew-2020-4

This is being labeled as a beer, however I think the process may be more similiar to wine.

Regardless, I am not posting for an intense debate of what its classified as, but I am curious about the safety relating to the fermentation of fruits. I figured who better to ask than wine makers?

With everyone's experience in the fermentation of fruits, at what point should I be concerned with botulism and methanol? What other hazards should I be concerned with.

My fermentation process consisted of the following.

10 cups of boiled water
2.5 cups of granulated sugar
1 cup of raisins from box
2 tsp of dry active yeast
1 cleaned, chopped up pineapple with skin on (removed leaves)

Added sugar, pineapple, raisins to food grade container, poured hot water over them and stirred. Added the yeast after hot water has cooked.

I covered the container with a lid, similar to a Tupper ware lid. It was not completely air tight, however the pressure from gas was enough to keep the lid ""puffed up"", but not enough to pop off the container.

I sterilized all my equipment in each step. 

I have let the mixture ferment for 3 days. I would like to place them in glass containers to drink them but I have never fermented fruit like this before. I have experience in beer making but would like to hear from people who ferment fruits.


Hopefully I am posting in the correct place! Thanks for the help.",winemaking

Instead of using white sugar, I used what I had which was golden caster, meaning my brew was a little on the brown side. Who cares, right? Yeah so my dumb ass thought I might add in some dried wildflowers and butterfly peas for a more interesting colour. Great, I thought. Cute. 3 Days later I wake up to this monstrosity in my jar. It's not the usual mould you get with the odd brew. It's fluffy, very spore-y.  
Smells INCREDIBLE though.

What determines when grapes will appear?,"What determines when grapes will appear? Hello r/winemaking. I've observed something quite odd and thought I'd ask about it. Maybe even upload a picture for reference.

I planted a Canadice grape to the east side of my garden last year because a groundhog dug up my Pinot Gris the year before which killed it. There was decent growth in the year I planted it. In the same year I planted a Concord grape which had about the same growth.

 At the same time I planted the Pinot Gris I planted a Flame Seedless on the west side of my garden which grew really well but seems to not do too well when it comes to winter injury (a lot of the buds didn't sprout this year or last year. 

I know table grapes aren't ideal for making wine but I thought that this year I'd have more than what I wanted to eat so I thought I'd give it a try. However, once again, the Flame Seedless is struggling with only the first two buds sprouting and one at the top (I'm using the kniffin system). The Canadice grapes sprouted faster but are showing two clusters of grapes. This isn't the first time I've had a cluster of grapes in the year after I've planted a grape; the same thing happened last year with my Niagara grapes which I decided to keep because I've never tried them before.

My question, therefore, is what determines whether or not grapes will form on the vine? I'm wondering because there is a small chance that the Flame Seedless might not show any but for the second year in a row a smaller grape has. I've been interested in this for a while and I'm hoping to figure it out before next year where I'll hopefully get Concord grapes to make a sweet wine.",winemaking

When I racked my dandelion wine out of the primary fermenter and into a new demijohn, I did it over 15oz of golden raisins.

Before I racked it today, all of the raisins had settled to the bottom and the wine was a beautiful clear amber color. Unfortunately when I racked it, the raisins began to clog my autosiphon.

I had to leave all of the wine below the level of the raisins in the old demijohn, so my new jug is only about halfway full. There are also some small raisin bits and some dead yeast that made their way into the new jug, and the liquid is once again cloudy and unappealing to look at.

I'm incredibly frustrated. Although I did end up straining what was left in the old jug through some cheesecloth, and it tastes pretty good (I'm assuming it's safe to drink?).

At this point, it is noticeably weak on alcohol and sweet.  I am pretty confident that the fermentation is stuck.  I racked it off to a secondary and am not sure what to do.  My first thought was to try and restart it with some fresh yeast, but since this thing is so experimental for me i don't want to waste material on a lost cause.  my other thought was to just clarify and stabilize it.  the taste is pleasant, but too weak for my liking.  I'm also toying with the idea of fortifying it.

**Ingredients used:**

1. 16#‚Äôs Kirkland‚Äôs Mixed Berry Blend ($10/ea) - Blueberry, Blackberry, Raspberry
2. Granulated Sugar, 20 cups
3. Lallzyme EX (.6g), Cellar Science
4. Italian Volcano 100% Organic Lemon Juice (50 oz), from Costco
5. FT Rouge (7.8g), Cellar Science
6. EC1118 Yeast (5g), Lalvin
7. Go-Ferm Protect Evolution (7.5g), Cellar Science
8. FermFed (DAP Free) (9g), Cellar Science
9. Fermaid K (6g), Cellar Science
10. Super-Kleer K.C. (2.2 oz), Liquor Quik (Kieselsol and Chitosan for fining)
11. Potassium Metabisulfite (.5 tsp), Cellar Science
12. Granulated Sugar (6#) boiled in 2 cups water until clear to make Simple Sugar

**Notes:**

1. Started on Saturday evening, April 25th;
2. Ready to begin enjoying on May 16th (4 weeks after start); it was really good at this point after back-sweetening, but I‚Äôm sure it will get even better over the next few months as everyone says (and ‚Äúregular‚Äù wines do)
3. All additions were based on starting w/6 gals of juice; ended up with a little over 4.5 gals of wine
4. I decided NOT to add Potassium Sorbate to sterilize any potentially remaining yeast before back-sweetening. My primary reasoning was that I filtered using a sterile filter so assuming that will eliminate the remaining yeast. I also didn‚Äôt want to do this because K-Sorbate actually starts to add vegetative flavors as the wine ages. Also, I plan to keg mine for easier access by the glass, so if it does start to ferment more then I‚Äôll be fine with a little ‚ÄúSparkling Dragons Blood‚Äù.   
 That said, if you plan to drink all your wine within a year then I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about that, and rather lean more toward short-term protection with K-Sorbate regardless of filtration.
5. Left lid sitting loosely on top of fermenter (not snapped down) and no airlock/bubbler in the lid grommet during active fermentation.

**4/25 - Sat. Evening:**

* Mixed all these ingredients together in 7 gal fermenting bucket to start

1. (A.) 16# frozen fruit in a mesh bag
2. Water to about 4.5 gals
3. (B.) Sugar, (C.) Enzyme, (D.) Lemon Juice

* Measured starting Specific Gravity (B-SG) @ 1.090
* Notes:
   * did NOT add K-Meta at this point;
   * did NOT add tannin or yeast nutrients at this point as called for in original DD recipe; rather, added those with yeast a day later

**4/26 - Sun. Morning**

* Added the following, stirring well

1. (E.) Tannin powder, (F.) Yeast, (G.) Yeast Nutrient

‚Ä¶ stirred twice a day until‚Ä¶  


**4/29 - Thur. Evening**

* Measured SG and noticed I was about halfway through ferment and it seemed to be slowing. So I added the following:

1. (H.) and (I.) Yeast Nutrients (note these are additional yeast nutrients at about 1/3 to 1/2 through ferment that are not called for in original DD recipe)

... nutrients obviously helped kick up the ferment and ensure completion!  
‚Ä¶ continued stirring twice a day until‚Ä¶  


**5/6 - Wed. Evening**

* Noticed that ferment was pretty much done w/SG @ 1.000
* Removed fruit bag ‚Äî it was TINY! Clearly the enzymes had helped to extract all the fruit we were going to get in this batch. 
* Added (K.) K-Meta to help protect since ferment was done (and yeast no longer providing CO2 blanket to protect from oxidizing)
* Snapped down fermenting bucket lid and added Bubbler
* Stopped stirring to let it settle so I could rack to carboy on Saturday

**5/9 - Sat. Evening**

* Measured finishing SG (F-SG) @ 0.990 ‚Äî ferment is done!
* Racked off of gross lees to carboy
* Added (J.) fining agents, stirring the heck out of it to help degas
* Let sit and clear for a week

**5/16 - Afternoon**

* Nice, small layer of fine lees at bottom of carboy; wine looking very nice and clear already!
* Filtered with .5 Micron filter using small Buon Vino filter
* Performed tests for:
   * pH (3.01) @ 71.8F;
   * TA @ .62% tartaric;
   * SO2 @ 3.2ppm;
   * F-SG @ 0.990 so ABV = \~13.5% (Whew! That‚Äôs hot!)
* Added (L.) 6# Simple Sugar to back-sweeten

The resulting wine is a beautiful, clear and brilliant ruby red. (My wife said it looks like a beautiful ruby jewel!) We enjoyed a couple glasses on ice and it‚Äôs yuuuumy already!   


**Closing thoughts and observations:**  
It‚Äôs obviously very young as I‚Äôm making these observations, but the week I was letting it clear I was tasting it along the way, adding granulated sugar to a glass to test how the sugar might offset the tartness (which was, WOW, super-tart!) It had a VERY pungent/funky nose! So much so that, after sweetening the glass with some sugar, I actually asked my wife and my cousin to NOT smell it before they each tasted it. They loved the taste! Then I asked them to nose it and they both were like, ‚ÄúOh my gosh! What is that?!‚Äù Needless to say, the nose and the taste experiences weren‚Äôt lining up well. After filtering and sweeting with the simple sugar that small has definitely waned quite a bit, so I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôll continue to blow off whatever that funky odor is. One thought I have about the odor is that it‚Äôs so strong because I added so much fruit ‚Äî notice almost 3x what DD‚Äôs recipe calls for. But, I also think that the reason it‚Äôs such a deep ruby color is exactly because I added so much fruit as well. It really does taste great.

About the amount of fruit: when I make regular wine from fresh fruit (vitis vinifera ‚Äî my daughter likes to call them ‚Äúwine berries‚Äù &lt;grin&gt;), I use 100# to make about the same six gallons of wine but I obviously don‚Äôt add the water. This was curious to me so it just seemed like I ‚Äúneeded more fruit‚Äù in this wine.  I‚Äôm wondering, however, if this almost 3x more fruit than DD‚Äôs recipe called for isn‚Äôt the reason for the strong pungent (raw berry?) smell at this young age of the wine? I‚Äôm optimistic that this smell will ‚Äúblow off‚Äù with age, as it certainly mellows as the wine opens up. Meaning, as I decant this wine now for about 30 minutes that smell is almost gone. I also think one positive benefit from using 16# of fruit (vs 6#) was to give the wine more body, making it less ‚Äúwatery‚Äù. So, the mouthfeel of this one is akin a little more to a Pino Noir rather than a Rose or blush wine. Maybe that‚Äôs good for some folks, or maybe that‚Äôs bad ‚Äî just depends on your individual preferences and goals with the type of target wine you‚Äôre trying to make. That‚Äôs one of the many beauty‚Äôs of this art we call winemaking! 

Cost: The wine berries I buy from the Grand Valley AVA here in Colorado cost \~$1/lb. Whereas, the Costco Mixed Berries on a $/lb basis come out to about $2.50/lb! So, one might think it would be cheaper to make vinifera wine (I typically make Merlot, Cab Sauv, Cab Franc and Riesling); but since the original DD recipe calls for only 6#‚Äôs of Mixed Berries, the total fruit cost is \~$10 (or free if you have it in your back yard!) vs $100 to make the same volume of wine (# bottles).

About taste and that 6# of simple sugar for back-sweetening‚Ä¶  That certainly is a lot of sugar to add, but this wine is actually not a viscous as an dessert/ice wine, as you might imagine adding that much sugar. It is sweet, for sure, but I did a number of taste tests (with my wife is the primary ‚Äúapprover‚Äù, of course ‚Äî how else do you think I get to keep spending money on this hobby! LOL ) using varying amounts of sugar from 5g sugar/50ml of wine to 15g sugar/50ml of wine and it really needed a bit more sugar to balance both the tartness and the alcohol level (‚Äùhotness‚Äù). So, I ended up at about 8g/50ml (or 15-16% RS) which is around a German Auslese style Riesling level of sweetness. It currently has a very nice sweet/acid/alcohol balance, with a nice, soft mouthfeel and a little longer finish. It definitely hits the tongue sweet at first, with very noticeable fruit in the mid-palate, and the slightest ‚Äúzing‚Äù due to the high alcohol has you breath in after swallowing. It‚Äôs definitely not your normal one-dimensional blush/fruit wine! One final interesting note on taste here is that I get no hint of bitter tannin at all. So, I‚Äôm confident the FT Rouge contributed to the mouthfeel, but there‚Äôs definitely no ‚Äúrip your teeth off tannin‚Äôs‚Äù if you‚Äôre worried about that at all. I think you‚Äôd have to add a lot more tannin powder before you‚Äôd feel that‚Ä¶which, you may if that‚Äôs your thing! 

About the amount of sulfite: I prefer a lower sulfite wine in general and this wine ended up at about 3.5 ppm. I think this will be fine and provide enough protection due to a few factors: lower pH @ 3.01 (see graph), higher ABV of 13.5% and an on-point TA at \~ .62% tartaric.

Rhubarb Wine,"Rhubarb Wine My buddy and I are about to put up a batch of rhubarb wine.

Some fruits losing all taste after fermenting.,"Some fruits losing all taste after fermenting. Hey everyone!

I'm new to the wine scene. Last year my dad pretty much dumped about 100 pounds or apples and peaches. (We have quite a few trees)

The apple wine was made with many varieties and so was the peach. Both have a great color but both are borderline flavorless.

I've made a pineapple and a cranberry pineapple (fresh fruit) and that came out pretty bland too.

However, I've made mead, cranberry, black cherry, and sweet tea wines that were phenomenal.

I've purchased natural fruit flavoring in an attempt to not lose 8 gallons of salvageable wine.

In stores peach wine is commonly white grape with peach added. Should that be the approach? Should I stop the fermentation to leave flavor for these fruits? Make cider? Any advice is appreciated.

The problem is, that during that week, it heated up the entire space from 59¬∞F up to 113¬∞F and brought the humidity down to 16%, from 60%.

Immediately upon discovery, I moved every case out into the garage to let it cool down overnight. This morning, the bottle temperature was 56¬∞F, and humidity was 65%.

No corks popped, and no sparkling wines lost crown caps, either.

I'm too afraid to open bottles to find out. 

What should I expect? On the bright side, I paid for none of this wine; it was all a gift. So, there would be a $0 monetary loss.

Lockup Wine Kit ABV Help,"Lockup Wine Kit ABV Help Hi all. 
During lockdown I have had my first go at winemaking. Bought a Cellar 7 kit. Followed instructions and produced a ‚Äòdrinkable‚Äô red wine. All well and good but according to my (cheap) hydrometer it‚Äôs approx 10-11%. 
I would prefer my wine a bit more boozy. I understand the kit is made in a way to make the optimum bottle of wine out of the ingredients supplied. Also grasp that certain yeasts don‚Äôt perform well at higher ABV. 

All things considered I don‚Äôt expect the wine from a ¬£35 kit to be great (perhaps if I left it for a while to age in the bottle it would get better, but being my first attempt I can‚Äôt wait and have guzzled quite a bit of it already ü•≥) 
By my reckoning if it ain‚Äôt great, then it would be better being a bit more boozy than less so. 

So my question is. 
Is it as simple as adding more sugar to my primary fermentation brew?
Or simply adding less water?

Pros/cons of each?

I started two new kits this afternoon 

Solomon Grundy Shiraz ¬£36 
5 Ltr grape juice ADDED ONLY 16Ltr water(Recommended 18ltrs). Supposed to be bottle able/drinkable in 7 days. Just over 20 ltrs brew to hopefully make 24/25 bottles wine. Initial hydro reading 1.078

Kenridge Cabernet Merlot ¬£50
10 Ltr grape juice. Added 13 Ltr water. 23 ltrs brew. 4 week til ready to bottle. Hydro reading 1.080. 30 bottles

I think the Kenridge will be good as more grape juice, and should get probably 28/29 bottles hopefully around 12-13%

The Solomon Grundy I added less water than instructions dictated. So I will have a stronger wine hopefully around 12-13%, just less of it. 


I think I will just leave them and see what happens. But for arguments sake could I boil up 2 ltr sugary water and add it to the Solomon Grundy to up the ABV and get a couple extra bottles. Started fermentation approx 10hrs ago. 
And just out of interest...
How much theoretical sugar should be added to the 2 ltrs ...

How long from fermentation to bottling for white wines? reds? (This is a 6 gallon kit),"How long from fermentation to bottling for white wines? reds? (This is a 6 gallon kit) I have a chardonnay kit which I have improved on to attempt to make a much better tasting wine. I added a pound of grape skins/seeds I got from a friend with a small personal vineyard which I fermented on for two weeks before racking to a new carboy as well as some oak chips. It‚Äôs now mostly cleared in that second carboy and it‚Äôs been a month.

I know red wines benefit from a year in the carboy before bottling, or at least that‚Äôs what I hear. This all leads me to two questions:

1: How long is normal aging period in carboys for white wines before bottling? A year for reds seems reasonable but seems like too long for white which don‚Äôt age as gracefully. (If you also happen to agree that reds don‚Äôt need a full year, how long do you age them?)

2: This chardonnay is in a secondary and has cleared entirely to the naked eye (though I know there‚Äôs more I can‚Äôt see). It is does not seem to have any residual carbonation as per my taste test and I assume this is because of when I racked it. Is a tertiary carboy beneficial before bottling?

"Small Wineries and Consumers: struggles, desired outcomes, strategies and support...","Small Wineries and Consumers: struggles, desired outcomes, strategies and support... Hi everyone, 

this community is very interesting and inspiring. As being a wine enthusiast and lover myself, I am very motivated when I see so many people trying to master the craft of wine making. I wish you all a great success.

As loving the wine so much, it is only natural for me to have this great vision of making my own wine, vineyard and winery. But before I leap into it I want to do some research and see what the points I should be aware of are. I want to understand the problems that small wineries are facing, as well as people who like and prefer to buy and drink wine from small wineries, homemade wine makers and similar. I find that this community, all together has a lots of experience and I hope you can help me.

By having this input I would be able to focus on certain problems and struggles and see how I could improve it or even fix it. 

1. If some of you already have a small winery or are familiar with some, I am interested to know more about the struggles of making one happen and keeping it afloat. In the sea of winemakers and well established brands, what **can**, **should** and **shouldn‚Äôt** you do in order to put your name and wine out there and make your passion of wine making also profitable for the benefit of your consumers, staff and family. My guess is that distribution, competition, brand building and strategies are some of the areas you are struggling with, but I would like to learn more.
2. On the other hand, I would like to learn more about the consumers (such as myself ‚Äì until I become a wine maker one day ;) )  that like to experiment with wine, try as much as they can  and give a chance and support to not so known names in wine making, to smaller wineries and to be authentic in their palate, wine collection and taste in general, not just go for the mainstream. 

If some of you would like to help me and you prefer to talk instead of write you can book an appointment with me at:

The wine has been maturing in a plastic container for seven months in the cool/dark cellar.

Today I did my first taste test a couple of days ago and... I was pleasantly surprised, It looks clear and nice. It tastes OK for being my first try ever. **I would describe it as; Light, not sweet, some acidity.**I have a alcohol measuring stick in glass that shows 10% alcohol volume but I don't know if its accurate.

**I would like it to be a bit heavier and a bit sweeter. How do I achieve this?**

Glycerine 250ml  
Gelatine (small plastic bag, jello consistency)   
Kieselsol (small plastic bag, this is for clearing the wine)

Should I use all this or none of it? As I understand it the Gelatine and Kieselsol is for making it clear but it already is.

I've opened a bottle or two recently and it's not really wine anymore. It's not infected with bacteria or anything like that. It's not offensive in any way, it's just not wine really.

Re-bottling questions,"Re-bottling questions Hey everyone!  


I work for a WSET course provider, and we are looking at adapting to this changing situation and focusing on online courses mainly. The main issue with this is being able to provide the students with the wine samples they will need, so we have decided to re-bottle the wines, transferring them from the classic 750ml to small 50ml containers that we can post to the students.

 What would be the best method to re-bottle, maintaining the quality and allowing the wine to be ok for at least a month after the re-rebottling? We imagine that we would have to sparge/blanket with argon or nitrogen, but we don't know if there is a simpler method that won't require us to buy and install an incredibly expensive bespoke bottling line. 

Is there another method to transfer the wine anaerobically or adding gas? Could this job be outsourced to a bottling company? Would they be ok adapting to such small containers?

It was very good but after seeing her recipe i figured if we did some research and get some better supplies we could really improve upon it.  OK so here is the part i don't understand.  In her recipe which i have no idea where she got it and i haven't seen anything similar it calls for  1 gallon of muscadines, 9 pounds of sugar, 3 gallons of water and 1 pkg of bread yeast.  She mixes the ingredients all together lets it sits for a day then she puts it 1 gallon jugs with latex balloons as airlocks.   We have since done 3 or 4 batches of the typical type recipes you would get online.  Ex. wine yeast, nutrient, etc we even have a hydrometer and have been keeping notes of our process.   We mix all the ingredients including campden tablets  together then add the yeast the next day.   We stir it daily for about 5-6 days then bottle it into 1 gallon jugs with regular airlocks.  The confusing part is that her recipe has repeatedly turned out better and i have no idea why, even more frustrating it doesn't even seem like her recipe should work at all.

"First time making wine, looking for some advice","First time making wine, looking for some advice Hello all! I just stumbled upon this subreddit at the best time. 

With this lockdown, I took it upon myself to give home wine making a shot. A friend got me wilkos express wine yeast compound. So I got some 100% organic juice. This is a very basic and amateur approach to making wine at home, but the point is to just dip my toe first before jumping right in.

So what i am doing is making the wine in the same bottle the juice came in, it's a 1 liter bottle. Since it's already sterilized it would make this an easy start. I poured out a bit of the juice, heated it up and dissolved a 1/4 of a cup of sugar in it. Which was I added back to the bottle and shook it. Then I added a bit of the wilkos yeast.

Everything is going splendidly so far! A few days later the bubbles started to really ramp up, as I do not have an airlock I am using the condom method. Again please bare with me, its a VERY amateur approach I know. 

So far things are looking beautifully, but I have a question. It's seems there's a build up on the top of the bottle. Similar to fruit pulp and what not. The smell is perfectly fine and sweet still. So no issues there. My main concern, once this finishes fermenting, how should I go about pouring it out? I certainly don't want to mix it all up and have a cloudy thick final result. But I also don't know whether this is actually a BAD sign in the wine fermenting process. From my research, it seems most things should be settling at the bottom and the top should be clear. I have the opposite so far, the top is thick pulpy mess, strange since its from juice not actual fruits. Can someone advise on what this build is exactly? And should he concerned? Once the fermentation is finished, as in when the bubbles stop, how do I go about transferring it to another container?


All advice is highly appreciated and thank you for your time.

Much love",winemaking

Reducing acidity of cold climate wines,"Reducing acidity of cold climate wines I am brewery owner, and my love of wine has been growing over the years. Using local ingredients in the beers is something important to me, and making wine from locally-grown grapes is also something I value.

Personally, I am a red wine lover. I am spoiled by the big, tannic, fruity wines of the West Coast and Italy. Here on the East Coast (Pennsylvania) we have a number of producers making really excellent white wines, but the red wines (both vinifera and hybrid varieties) tend to be quite acidic.  I have been doing research for the past week to learn about why, and it seems to do with the amount of ripening growers are able to achieve in a season. Is this correct?

I am curious if there has been progress in producing colder climate red wines that have more balance? Are there tricks or methods to reduce the acidity in the final product? It seems that wineries focus on single varietals; am I wrong to think that blends would help create more balanced and expressive wines?

To any east coast growers/vintners here, I mean no insult or offense. It's genuine curiosity on my part.",winemaking

Fermenting Pinot Noir got a little too hot while I wasn't watching.,"Fermenting Pinot Noir got a little too hot while I wasn't watching. First time winemaker, doing 6 gallons of Pinot Noir. 

Long story short, everything has been going well bubbling away, but the primary was getting a little cooler than I had hoped (~62F) and the bubbling started to slow, so I employed a fermwrap to raise it a few degrees (was hoping 80F). Came back to check on it a few hours later and it was at 97F(!). I didn't even think the fermwrap could raise temps that much, so I removed the fermwrap and put a fan on it to help passively cool it while I'm actively monitoring the temp. 


I've read this can result in undesirable flavors in the wine. Anyone have this happen, and have an idea of what I should expect in terms what impact this will have on the flavor? I feel like putting wine yeast on a rollercoaster of temperatures is going to result in some weird flavors?",winemaking
First attempt - please comment on my method.,"First attempt - please comment on my method. Covid19 lockdown boredom and the fact that our alcohol sales have been banned during this time got me interested in home wine making as a hobby :)

I started my very first experimental batch 5 days ago from info I could gather online. Would really appreciate some input and things I might be doing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Note:

\- I am stuck with what I had at home and mostly only consumable items are allowed for sale.  This means no hydrometer, anchor instant bakers dry yeast and plastic containers.  
\- I am aiming to create a **dry red wine**.  
\- With this substandard type of yeast I hope to reach 10% ABV which influenced my guess of how many sugar I needed to add.  
\- The ambient temperature where fermentation is happening so far ranged from 19 - 21 deg C (66 - 70 F).  We are going into winter and this was the warmest place I could find and it is bound to go down a few degrees more as time progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Method so far:

Day 1: bought 19kg black, seedless, sweet tasting, bulk/discounted grapes.  After removing stems and bad grapes I ended up with **15kg (33 pounds) of grapes**. I washed and crushed these by hand and added them to a sanitised, open, plastic container.  Added **10 liters (2.6 gal) of spring water.** Added an **7 cups of sugar** (I added 7 cups more on day 3). **Added 20 grams (0.7 ounce) of yeast**. Mixed well trying to aerate with oxygen.  The total mix resulted in about 25 - 27 litres (\~7 gal) volume.  Covered with cloth.  The next day it was properly bubbling.

Day 2 - 5:  Pushed down rising grapes 3 times a day - initially more vigorous to incorporate O2 and less (only pushing down) as time progressed to avoid too much O2.  On day 3 I added **7 more cups  of sugar** in a small amount of liquid comprising of water, strong tea and fresh lemon juice (heard tea + lemon can be a homemade yeast nutrient).  Adding this extra sugar mix \`re-ignited\` the bubbling within a few hours which were waning a bit since observing the first reaction.  On day 5 it was still bubbling at - which I would guess - a sufficient rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Intention going forward:

Day 6 - 9: Keep pushing grapes down once or twice daily

Day 10: Siphon off the liquid into new seal-able 4 liter (1 gal) plastic containers.  My airlock will consist of a plastic sandwich bag cable tied close around the openings with a small hole to release pressure when needed.  If I can find balloons by then I will use those instead.  I am not really sure what to do with the leftover grapes/must at this stage.  Thinking of throwing them in a cloth and lightly squeezing out the liquid and distribute equally among the containers?

Day 20: Siphon again into similar clean containers to get rid of sediment.  I am considering adding a small amount of **store bought gelatin** to aid in the clearing process?

Day 30 - 40: Siphon in to glass bottles (which I hope to find by then) and seal for long term aging. I probably **won't have sulfates** to add at this stage.  Is there alternative I can buy in a basic grocery store that would act as preservative?

Day 50: Start tasting a the first bottle (maybe 1 a week) if our alcohol sales are still banned :)

An Island Nation of Redditors with legalized drugs,"An Island Nation of Redditors with legalized drugs  

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE‚Äôs and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

What does unoaked red wine taste like ? Evaluating my Pinot Noir at 7 months ...,"What does unoaked red wine taste like ? Evaluating my Pinot Noir at 7 months ... First time making wine of any kind.  Pinot Noir from our very small (300 vine) vineyard harvested October 5 and pitched yeast on October 7.

Entire process has been in a 14gal. stainless pot.

I cannot think of any parts of the process that have gone wrong or that were done poorly - everything has gone very well except, possibly, we did let it sit in tank for a LONG time before doing the first racking ... we pressed off the skins on Oct. 25 and it sat, undisturbed (decent acidity and 14+ alcohol) for ... 3 months ?  It was a while.

Other than that, it's all been very by the book.

So now we are tasting it and I don't exactly know what I am tasting.

On the one hand, I am quite certain it is not ""bad"" as in spoiled.  On the other hand, it's definitely not great.  My hope is that I simply have totally un-oaked Pinot that has lived its entire life in stainless and that I can improve and polish it with oak (or other treatments ?)

I don't have a highly educated or sophisticated pallet, so bear with me while I try to describe ...

In the front of the mouth and held in the mouth it's quite good, but then as you swallow, you get an ... almost numbing in the back-top of the mouth and there is a very dulling aftertaste to it ...

When I think of oaking, I think of very tannic wine that gets softened by the oak, but I don't feel like this wine is very tannic at all ... 

It's almost like you have Pinot Noir in your mouth and it turns to chardonnay as you swallow it :)

Any thoughts ?",winemaking

Winemaking licenses,"Winemaking licenses Good afternoon (or morning),  


I have scoured the internet for this answer and I can't seem to find it. I am applying to the TTB right now to become a bonded winery. Once that gets approved, then the ABC application gets submitted. Does anyone know if it is possible to begin fermentations while the winegrower license is being approved?  


The reason I ask is because the TTB should get through the application in 60ish days. The ABC will probably take another 3 months. That would be put at the end of September for getting approved and harvest begins in the middle to late August. Does the ABC let people make wine for the winery if the person has TTB approval but the ABC winegrower license is in process of being approved? I tried to begin working with the landlord of the warehouse my parents rent from for their business back in January. He has literally taken a month and a half to get back to us with each question. So now it is May and things are finally moving along but I am afraid I lost my chance for this year if the ABC license needs to be approved as well before any winemaking begins.  


Any insights?

Industry folks - I have $2M-$3M in liquid capital to spend starting a world class winery or lose it trying.

I'm leaning towards Willamette AVA and looking for actionable advice moving forward! I'm not currently involved with the winemaking industry, so please let me know where any of this sounds insane. (Warning: all of it may sound insane).

**Who am I:** My formal education is in graduate level quantitative science and I founded a technology startup (not software) several years ago which recently closed an acquisition deal. This has brought in a significant windfall of cash. I've enjoyed the process of taking this startup from concept stage to market but I am looking for a major life change. I want to start on a creative endeavor where I work with my hands and the earth. I love wine and see it as a form of artistic expression. No doubt Burgundy pinot is a phenomenal creation of humankind. I've brewed beer at home for several years (mostly aged sours) and roasted coffee commercially on a very small scale.

**My Goal:** I'm in my early thirties and looking to do 2 years of preparation before I make any kind of commitment. My goal is to focus on creating a world class wine first and foremost without being burdened by cash flow strain. I'm not looking to speed towards break-even by hiring a crack marketing team to push distributions, tastings, events, etc. I don't want to pay a winery to print me a few cases of my ""private label"" (oh my God is that embarrassing). What I aim to do is get online as quickly as possible with a decent product that has potential and start adjusting variables from there. I'm very much leaning towards cool-climate Pinot Noir, Gamay, and Chardonnay, such as grown in Willamette and Burgundy. But open to other ideas...

**My Thoughts on First Steps:** As I said before, I want to limit prep time to 2 years. My first inclination is to rent a house near Napa, attend viticulture/oenology classes at UC Davis, and participate in a local harvest. I would also be interested in working for a custom crush facility to see how they operate. Concurrent with that I'd do an in-depth tour of the Willamette valley, and compare grapes from different sub AVAs while keeping an eye on the property market. Once ready, I would probably purchase a 20-30 acre vineyard with producing vines that either has wine-making onsite or uses custom crush facility. I recognize I will need to hire an experienced vineyard manager and cellar master before I can take this on myself.

**Questions so many questions:** What is the most expeditious way to get educated? Are UCD classes worth it - should I look into the full 2 year program or do a shorter online version? Should I do harvest or just look for work at a custom crush? I prefer west coast- is Willamette the right area or is this already too saturated (CA seems extremely saturated)? How much capital would I be expected to put up vs how much I can get from bank/SBA/etc. Assuming rule of thumb 20% down, would $1M be enough to get me a $5M property? How do you even go about looking for property (i.e. local real estate agent? Winegrowers association? Internet?). What are the best books I can buy? Should I buy producing vines or grow from seedling? What clones should I look for? Should I live on the vineyard property or off-site? Who is the first person I should talk to about this plan besides random strangers on the internet? (consultant? networking event? another winemaker?). Thanks guys!

is it worth it to get new corks, add K Meta and bottle again?     Honestly it wouldn‚Äôt bother me Much because I tried the Leftover amount and it had a slight mount of gas in it.

Would degas Again, add K Meta then bottle again.

"I finished a few batches of my first ""juice wine"". I made some mistakes and here's what I learned.","I finished a few batches of my first ""juice wine"". I made some mistakes and here's what I learned. As easy as it is to buy a half-gallon of juice from the store, empty a cup or two out, add in a cup or two of sugar and a teaspoon of yeast, shake well and let sit (with the cap slightly open to allow CO2 out), I messed it up a little. Here's what I learned: 

\*I introduced air accidentally when tasting/smelling during fermentation:

Do not open the cap and smell it or taste it until your ready to ""rack"" it or drink it. I made this mistake on my first batch. I smelled it a few times a few days into it. I tasted it at about 10 days in. I tasted it again like 14 days in (very tiny taste tests). And I finally decided to enjoy it at about 20 days in. On that day I noticed that there was white mold looking stuff growing on the plastic where there was room for foam. Unsure, I opened it to smell it, and it made me gag. It was way sour. I am pretty certain that with all my fidgeting/smelling/tasting, I must have kept letting air in and  CO2 out. I discarded it. It made me gag!

On the other two batches, I had going at around the same time, I was a little better at letting them be. Although I did open, and smell one of them a handful of times, and tasted it 1 time at about 14 days in. It tasted good, but I didn't end up drinking it until a few days later. I noticed it too ended up smelling sour but not nearly as bad as that discarded batch. Unsure of how these batches are supposed to turn out, I thought that's how it is supposed to be. I went ahead and shared some and we just added sugar to each glass. It was ok but I was disappointed. 

On the last batch of apple wine I had going, I left it alone entirely until I decided to enjoy it. This was a few days ago. I assumed it would be just as sour as that last batch, but to my surprise, it was pretty delicious. It smelled mostly of apples and had a bit of a alcohol smell, but nothing bad at all - it was expected and hoped for. Tasted great. Actually, it tasted pretty amazing considering how cheap/simple it was to make. Exactly what I had initially hoped for! 

So lesson learned: don't touch your juice wine until your ready to rack it or drink it! Apparently, oxygen is the enemy (and I'm all the other microbes I unintentionally let in while handling it during fermentation).

I'm glad I didn't give up.",winemaking
Can a high pH stop fermentation or is it lack of nutrients?,"Can a high pH stop fermentation or is it lack of nutrients? I made a mead 2 months ago, it's not the first time using this recipe only difference is I used a different yeast and added the juice and zest of 2-3 oranges. The recipe called for only the zest. It started at 1.100 and 2 months in its at 1.010 so I figured it was not going to go any further and added sodium metabisulphite and I going to let it age.

So my question is is it the high pH because I added the orange juice or lack of nutrients (for the nutrients I only use Young's yeast nutrient witch contains Diammonium Phosphate, Ammonium Sulphate)...

The funny thing is that it tastes amazing even though it's only 2 months old. I put oak chips and it lifted up the flavour...

Modified 19th Century Dandelion Wine Recipe w/Photos.,"Modified 19th Century Dandelion Wine Recipe w/Photos. ###Modified 19th Century Dandelion Wine 1 Gallon Batch

##Preparing for Primary Fermentation 

Ingredients for Primary Fermentation:

- 450 grams/1 lb. [Dandelion petals](https://imgur.com/a/Csd2TR6) without no green plant material
- 1.4 kilogram/3 lb. sugar
- 1 orange
- 2 lemons
- 142 grams/ 5 oz. raisins 
- 4 grams/ 1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (DAP)
- 1 gram wine yeast
- 1 campden tablet
- 1 gal. spring water

S.G.: 1.130   F.G.: 1.022

1. Begin by stripping the dandelions of all green plant materiel.

2. Carefully zest or peel the citrus taking care not to get any of the pith (white layer between peel and fruit). Save the remainder of the fruit.

3. In a clean &amp; sanitized fermenter, crush the campden tablet and put into bottom of fermenter. Also add the raisins and nutrients (DAP). Juice the citrus and add. 

4. In large stock pot: add water, sugar, citrus peels/zest and dandelion petals. Stirring until sugar dissolves, bring to a boil. * I used a extra fine reusable nylon brew bag for the flower petals *

5. Once boiling reduce heat to slow boil. While stirring/steeping petals continue to boil for 60 minutes.

6. Remove stock pot from heat to cool.

7. Strain and add must from stock pot when it is still slightly warm into fermenter. Add an airlock without any liquid/sanitizer in it. Allow to sit at room temperature a full 24 hours for the campden to sanitize the must.

8. Rehydrate wine yeast according to package instructions.

9. Pitch yeast into must and mix well. Fill the airlock and place onto the fermenter.

10. Stir for the first 3 days to aerate the [must](https://imgur.com/a/1U9R975).


##Preparing for Secondary Fermenter

Ingredients for Secondary Fermentor:

- 80 grams/ 2.8 oz. [dandelion petals](https://imgur.com/a/6VCh2cE) without any green plant material.

- .10 grams potassium metabisulfate  

- 12 fl. oz. spring water

- 15ml. glycerin 

1. Bring spring water to boil.

2. Place dandelion petals in sanitized &amp; clean jar (w/ lid) with the potassium metabisulfate.

3. Pour 12 fl. oz. of hot spring water into the jar over the petals. Close the lid and shake well. Set aside until completely cool. If prepared before time of racking into secondary, place jar into freezer.

4. When ready to use the dandelion petals in secondary (remove them from freezer if you chose to freeze them) and loosen lid on jar to where it‚Äôs barely on and let sit a full 24 hours.

5. Racked day 5 from primary fermenter to secondary leaving behind raisins/lees.

6. Add the 80 grams of [dandelion petals](https://imgur.com/a/i2Ku3Mq) and spring water into secondary.

7. Degas daily and punch down cap formed of petals.

8. After 5 days [racked](https://imgur.com/a/sbD3Cxr) again into clean sanitized carboy adding the 15ml. glycerin and removing petals from secondary.

9. A week and a half later it cleared. I added campden tablet and bottled. Original recipe said to cellar for at least 6 months. Note: the wine appearance will be slightly hazy, light golden color and not completely crystal clear. 



**How it was modified:**
- * Originally the recipe called for 1lb. of raisins, I reduced that to 5oz.*
- *The recipe called for 1/4 of a yeast cake in which I am certain meant bread yeast. I chose to use CDB wine yeast.*
- *I used yeast nutrient (DAP).*
- *I used campden/metabisulfate.*
- *For the orange I used a blood orange peel and juice.*
- *Added 15ml. glycerin for extra body and mouthfeel.*

Notes: I debated how much to modify the recipe. I considered using SNA with GoFerm, Fermaid O, Fermaid K. 
   I grew up listening to the older generation talking about dandelion wine. My dad use to talk about how his brother and him use to be sent out to pick the dandelions by his dad. I know my great grandfather and grandfather both use to make this wine. However my dad had no interest in making it. Dad use to say that the older generation believed that the dandelion wine possessed medicinal properties, but I honestly don‚Äôt know how accurate that is. My dad passed a few years ago and I wish I would‚Äôve asked him more about his memories concerning making the wine. I do believe that the original recipe probably evolved slowly over time and I hope to produce something similar to what my elders consumed. I thought others may like to try making it for themselves. 
   Considering it‚Äôs made with a weed that most people seem to despise it‚Äôs easy to harvest enough flowers, though my neighbor looked at me like I was slightly mentally impaired when I asked if I could pick his dandelions.
   I chose to add the additional petals to secondary in an attempt to obtain some more of the natural floral notes and flavors. By following the recipes requirement of boiling for 60 minutes I wondered how much of the delicate floral notes may have been lost. Also, during the boil it develops a sweet and starchy aroma similar to the smell of sweet corn on the cob being boiled. I tasted the must before pitching the yeast and it had a pleasant flavor although obviously sweet. At bottling it tasted young but had pleasant, warm floral notes and finished sweet at a little over 14%ABV. I‚Äôm currently on the hardest phase of winemaking.... the waiting period for aging.",winemaking
How long for primary fermentation,"How long for primary fermentation I am new to home brewing, I made my first gallon of concord grape juice, sugar, and a whole packet of champaign yeast from red star. I used a 1-gallon jar with 2.5 cups of sugar and about 0.75-0.80 gallons of concord grape juice.
My two-chamber airlock activity has slowed down significantly, but still releases a CO2 bubble, and there is still positive pressure. There are also small bubbles rising to the top of the wine as well. There has been a color change as well, turning from dark purple to a more burgundy red. There is some sediment on the bottom as well. 

I have been watching a lot of CS Brews, and they said the best way to know is to get a gravity reading, but I did not have a hydrometer at the time. My brew is about 9 days old.

1. I want to do the whole process myself; is plastic worse than glass? What's the reusability of plastic containers? 

2. Are wine kits the way to go for a first time, or should I get fresh? If kits, is there a specific wine kit that worked well for anyone? I tend to prefer low tannin reds, but I'm very open to trying new things. 

3. I live in a very hot place; how critical is temperature control? Does it vary from stage to stage? Should I store my finished product inside at all times? 

4. Is there a recommended equipment set that's best for purchase? I'd like to do 5 gallons or more at a time. 

5. I love the idea of making new flavors or combinations of odd but tasty wines; are there any fruits (aside from durian) or spices that are a definite no-go? Has anyone had success with things like a√ßa√≠ or kumquat or kiwi?

I last made wine years ago, in a drunken haze. We ended up not doing secondary fermentation and just racking it all after waiting too long. It still turned out decent every time.


I was looking at some PDFs of kit instructions and primary fermentation generally wants altogether 23 liters of liquid, which is pretty much the brim. If I measured the volume right they is,¬†and I'm about 75% sure I did.


I'm wondering if it's a good or bad idea to do primary fermentation in the 54 liter demijohn and then secondary fermentation in the 23 liter carboy. The guy included an airlock for the carboy but not the demijohn.


Alternatively, I'm thinking I could use a bit less water and just do the one fermentation before bottling. Might be the lazy reintroduction.

The color is a bit skinny for Merlot, and i am afraid if i filter it that it will go away totally.

I've wanted to make my own wine for ages, and finally got a kit (Northern Brewer's basic winemaking kit) to do so. It came with everything but the fruit, basically. So I got some frozen raspberries (since that's a lot easier to get my hands on right now than wine grapes) with the intention of making that my first wine.

However, I was pleasantly surprised by the greenspace behind my house this week - turns out we have TONS of honeysuckle that I didn't know about. It's beautiful and chemical-free, so it feels like a waste not to do something with it.

I did some googling and discovered I could make wine out of it. However, I'm anxious, since I've never made any wine before, and now I'm wondering if it's worth it to try or if it's wiser to pass it by and stick to the raspberries. But the raspberries can keep forever in the freezer, while the honeysuckle won't. Decisions, decisions.

About a month ago I started a batch of blueberry wine. As I‚Äôm on quarantine and really was just bored, I used bread yeast (pls do not come after me for this, I know it‚Äôs bad). It‚Äôs been happily bubbling along. I racked it a couple days ago as I had a heavy amount of sediment on the bottom and fermentation seemed to be slowing. I did notice lots of floaty bits once it was bumped around a bit which I deduced were yeast. 

However, since the racking I‚Äôve noticed some sediment type stuff clinging to the sides of my bottle and a ton of sediment on the bottom. I gently tipped the bottle and noticed quite a bit of suspended cloudy stuff that I disturbed during tipping. 

So, my questions:
Is this cloudy stuff bad? It was staying at the bottom until I disturbed it.
How soon is too soon to rack again?
Should I add a campden Tablet?
At this point would it be stupid to add actual wine yeast in a few days if I ordered some?
Also any other advice is welcome!

Well that was today and wow I was not expecting the smell that came with it. It almost has a sour pungent smell but it is quite hard to explain the smell. The color of it was surprisingly clearer than I imagined. The taste was ok but at best a little on the bland dry side to my unprofessional pallet. I sweetened the test sample and it mad the taste a little better but it still felt like was something missing, and the smell was so off putting that I cannot tell if I should keep it or discard it.

Secondary fermenter headspace,"Secondary fermenter headspace First time trying my hand at wine. Just realised I may have a problem on my hands.

Have 13l of peach wine currently fermenting in a 25l glass carboy. No problem as the fermentation is going strong so there's plenty of CO2 around.

My problem comes up when I have to transfer to secondary. As a beer brewer I've always just bottled straight from primary after cold crashing so I've never had to consider secondary before.

I only have 25l or large vessels that are suitable for secondary. Two 25l glass carboys, a 25l plastic bucket, and a 30l plastic tank fermenter (which currently has an IPA in it, almost time to bottle). So I will have a major issue with too much headspace and I'm worried about oxidisation and spoiling. 

Luckily primary has only just kicked off so I have a little time on my hands to think this through.

Ideally I'd like to rush off and buy myself a smaller vessel, but sadly we're in lockdown so that ain't gonna happen.

I think my options are:
1. Rack it to the other glass carboy after 7-10 days and hope for the best.
2. Rack it slightly earlier so that there is a bit more fermentation going on and hope it fills the headspace with CO2. 
3. Rack it after 7 - 10 days and chuck a little more sugar in to kick off another mini fermentation and hope it fills the headspace with CO2.
4. Add a load more sugar and water to it now so that the headspace is less of an issue and then do any of 1 - 3 above to deal with the (greatly reduced) headspace issue when I do rack.
5. Just chuck in lots more sugar now to make the ABV higher than I'd like and then dilute with water when I rack to fill up the headspace.
6. Do a little bit of 4 &amp; 5.
7. Bottle the IPA in the larger fermenter a bit earlier than I'd like and then transfer the 13l that's currently fermenting to it and add enough sugar and water so as to make enough to fill the headspace when I rack to secondary.

Help! Are there any hacks that I'm not aware of as a noob?

Any Italian winemakers care to throw some advice my way?,"Any Italian winemakers care to throw some advice my way? So here goes!  This year I was able to get my hands on 5 gallons each of some Italian varietals for the first time, Montepulciano and Aglianico.  I did some homework on these and found the basics: Monte is a table red similar to a Sangiovese, and Aglianico is a big red that does well with long aging (5+ years in the barrel).

Both were picked &amp; pressed in September and have been sitting happily in a pair of 5gal Hungarian oak barrels I have.  I racked them once each in around Nov/Dec, and used the Monte to top off the Aglianico.  I topped the Monte off with some Cab that I had from the previous year.  Both taste fine, but both (expectedly) are a bit green.  But their flavor profiles have switched.  The Monte is still a brighter red to look at, and the Aglianico a deep blood-red, but I'm liking the taste of the Monte better right now.

Back-story time.  When I got the grapes, my name was called for the Monte when the bin was nearly empty.  My grapes were very sludgy and I had a metric fuck-ton of seeds to deal with. Racking this wine caused my pump's in-line filter to clog 4 times just with 5 gallons.  The taste was very sharp and gritty initially, with little complexity or finish.  Contrast that with the Aglianico which tasted like it could go straight from the press to the bottle.  Even the juice from the grape off the vine had complexity front and back and a bright taste all the way thru.  My name was called first for these so I had nothing but perfect bunches of grapes off the top of the bin, no sludge at all.

So I guess my question is should I keep doing what I've been doing and let these wines sit or should I give in to my urge to tinker with them because I have too much time on my hands thanks to quarantine?

TLDR: I have 2 wines that have swapped palette profiles in the 7 months since they were pressed, should I do anything about that?",winemaking

My intent is to keep the scale small enough so that I'm not spending all my damn time working. I want to invest time into my family and community.

* What size vineyard is needed to make a living and support a family? Do we need to plant 5 acres? 10?
* Is it possible to sell locally only, and not worry about contracts with large liquor and wine companies to get my product distributed all over the country?
* Is there a major difference in profit in selling grapes vs selling wine I've made myself?
* Is there a major difference in profit between having a tasting room and not having one? Considering fixed operational costs and employee wages/salaries, I felt like this could be a major time and money hole, but I could also see it being very profitable. I guess there are a lot of variables.
* If it's not possible, would it be feasible to supplement income with some other type of agricultural product (apples, milk from cows, crops, honey, or mead made from honey, etc) on a manageable scale?

The sugar definitely went in, so it isn't a case of forgetting to chaptalise, and the ferment never ran any hotter than 25¬∞C. We've also tested the ebulliometer against a standard and that

"First wine batch (at home, 4wk kit), a couple questions","First wine batch (at home, 4wk kit), a couple questions First I'm moderately experienced working with beer (concentrate kit and whole grain) and Cider, but am new to wine making.

I started this batch of wine 13 days ago.  The directions say it should be ready for secondary tomorrow and at/below 0.997g. One is supposed to add a stabilizer at this point. However, it's still bubbling every 20 seconds or so thru the airlock.   The fermenting area sits around 17 or 18c temperature (63-65f), so I expect it's just being slower than normal.   


A few kit details:

* 4wk kit, Reisling style, I'll likely back sweeten it a bit.
* bentonite clay goes in with the must
* Starting gravity was 1.100 (does the bentonite raise the specific gravity enough to matter?)
* Yeast is Lalvin EC-1118, fermentation was vigorous for the first week and a bit, now it's slowing.

Three questions:

1. How much longer do you think it'll need due to the lower fermentation temp (It's well within EC-1118's preferred range, so I'm not overly worried)
2. How much (if it's even measurable) does the Bentonite clay affect the SG reading?
3. If the hole size is about right, can one cork a screw top bottle?  My LHBS is closed and I cannot buy bottles as planned.  I have a big corker meant to screw onto the workbench (Hey, I got it for free)

Blackberry wine not fermenting - help?,"Blackberry wine not fermenting - help? Hi all!

So I've pitched my yeast into my must a couple of days ago and it doesn't look like anything is happening - I was hoping that the brains trust here can help me troubleshoot and save this wine.

Here's the process I've followed so far:

1. Cleaned out my [fermenting pail](https://www.grainandgrape.com.au/products/category/search/7PAIL%2025L%20WITH%20LID--pail-white-plastic-25-litre-with-lid),
2. Emptied my frozen bwild blackberries into the pail, along with approximately 3-5 litres of water (to assist in thawing).
3. Added three crushed campden tablets, along with approximately one teaspoon of [Pectinase](https://www.grainandgrape.com.au/products/category/search/8ENZYME%20PECTINASE%2050G--enzyme-novoclair-speed-pectinase-50g).
4. Waited approximately 24 hours, then sprayed some sanitiser around the inside walls of the pail.
5. Rehydrated Lalvin EC-1118 as per packet instructions, then pitched yeast, mixed it up, and sealed with an airlock.

I pitched the yeast about 3 days ago, and have seen no bubbling since. It's been a bit cold here in Melbourne recently, so I've had the heater on as much as possible - internal air temps have been around 18-23 degrees celcius since pitching the years, though today has been much warmer (around 27).

I'm still very much a beginner, so I don't really have any fancy gear, and the pail has just been sitting out in the laundry where it's fairly dark.

Wine Making Advice.,"Wine Making Advice.  So I started homebrewing about a year ago. (Mostly Wine) and most of my attempts have done ok. But I would like to do better. 75% to 80% of my fermentations go alright. But sometimes they seem to stall. My last 2 brews turned out alright. I usually don't use heating pads or belts because fermenting at room temperature usually worked well for me. It sometimes took a couple of weeks maybe longer but it worked. So recently I heard a roomer that if you do use a heating pad and/or belt that the fermentation will go faster so I bought one.

I usually use distillers yeast to make my wine because the manufacturer says it can get up to 22% alcohol content and I like that because I prefer a high alcohol wine. So about a week ago I started a blueberry wine fermentation. I decide to use the heating pad I bought this time because I heard I could fully ferment my wine in 4-5 days. (Not counting Secondary Fermentation).

The only issue is when I tried to ferment the product with the distiller's yeast it stopped creating alcohol after about 5 days at around 13% when the target was set for 18%.

Now it has been 3 days later and fermentation has completely stopped.

I was hoping someone could read the fermentation procedure that I use all the time with fruit wines and maybe help me figure out what is going on with my blueberry wine fermentation and how to fix it.

I would also like the help of perfecting my wine fermentation procedure so 90% of my brewing will go right instead of just 75% to 80% of them.

Here is my usual winemaking procedure as follows: (I use this procedure with (Most) other fruits).

1. I sanitized EVERYTHING that was going to touch the mixture with Star San.
2. I added 8lbs of wild blueberries to a 2-gallon sanitized fermentation bucket, crushed them up with a potato masher and sterilized them with a Camden tablet for 24 hours.
3. The next day I filtered about 20 cups of tap water through a Brita filter to remove as much chlorine as I could.
4. I poured 15 cups of the filtered water in with the crushed blueberries then added enough sugar to give me about a 13% Potential alcohol reading on my hydrometer.
5. 13% was my usual fermentation target so I added just enough sugar to pump it up to 18% potential alcohol just for the hell of it and stirred the living crap out of it.
6. I weighed out about 6 to 8 grams of yeast (Give or take) (I always do double what is recommended by the manufacturer to try and overpopulate bacteria that (may) have a chance of getting in the fermenter for any reason).
7. Then I add about 3 teaspoons of Fermax Yeast Nutrient along with 1 teaspoon of Yeast Energizer.
8. I fit the airlock onto the gasket on the lid followed by adding the sanitizer water and close everything up and wait for fermentation to start.

After about 5 days on the heating pad at a temperature of about 85-90 F (The entire 5 days) (Controlled with a thermostat), I got an abv of 13% but by this time the bubbles were starting to fade.

Now it's 3 or 4 days later and the fermentation has come to a halt and the hydrometer is reading the same 13% reading. I pitched more yeast along with yeast nutrient but I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do.

It had started fermenting again earlier today but I have no clue if I lowered the quality of my wine or not by re-pitching yeast and nutrients.

So if anyone could give me some advice to help me find out why the fermentation is stalling that would be appreciated. Also, some advice on improving my fermentation method would help as well.",winemaking
Wine flavor problem.,"Wine flavor problem.  Hi, everyone. I am having a little trouble with the flavor profile of the wine I make at home. I have been homebrewing for about a year now and still haven't gotten quite what I like yet. I've made some decent wine but I've been trying to figure out why I'm lacking flavor in each one.

When I make (fruit wine) I will usually use frozen fruit that I unthaw from the grocery store. I usually make around a 2-gallon batch so I use 4lbs per gallon and that usually adds up to about 8lbs of frozen fruit. I also shoot for an alcohol content of around 12% to 13% most times.

I do the usual procedures... Sanitise all the equipment that touches the wine mixture, use Camden tablets, etc... wait 24 hours then add sugar and the chemicals (Wine Yeast, Yeast Nutrient, Yeast Energizer, and Tannins) Then I add just a tiny bit of citric acid.

After the fermentation is over I get a very musty co2 smell along with a strong alcoholic wine-like smell but that's all I get. It's like the flavor of the fruit was either hidden or destroyed and this happens almost every time. I don't usually age my wine very long only a couple of weeks. I'm sure it would help if I aged it longer.

When I taste the wines I make it's usually very harsh with an alcoholic bite. You taste (some) fruit but more wine flavor than anything.

How do I fix this? Is my procedure off? Or do I just need to age longer or something?

Is there any advice anyone can give me to make the wine taste like the fruit and not just wine?",winemaking

Can someone explain what ultimately happens to yeast after wine making?,"Can someone explain what ultimately happens to yeast after wine making? I understand that when the alcohol content gets too high, there is no sugar left, or certain chemicals are added, alcohol production ceases because the yeast can no longer ferment, but what actually happens to the yeast? Are they killed? Do they just go dormant? Are they sterilized and the last generation dies off naturally? Or something else?

Whether alive or dead, are the yeast filtered out at some point? Or are they still in the bottle when you buy it?

My understanding is that in beer making, the yeast mostly survives, and can be filtered out and repitched to start the next batch. Is there an equivalent for winemaking?

Thanks in advance. There seems to be a lot of easy to find information about how to make wine, and about how the fermentation process works, but it's a lot harder to find anything about the actual biology going on at the end of the process.

DM me ur Concord vines,"DM me ur Concord vines Hi there r/winemaking, we recently released Episode 1 of our webseries about American wine history, [Driven To Drink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOGI6D5DjA). We're trying to encourage people to think outside the tasting note, and connect with the stories and sacrifices that are behind their bottles.

We're working on an episode about the really amazing story behind the Concord grape. I work in a European-focused wine shop myself, and can say that unfortunately a lot of the people who would most appreciate the story are also the most closed off to it. So we gotta make a clear case to these folks early on for why they should care.

I believe there are many reasons to care about miraculous little Concord, and nobody says you have to drink and like a bottle of Manishewitz to appreciate its importance. Among these reasons is its importance to the American home grapegrower and home winemaker, who do all sorts of creative things with the grape with no expectation of commercial reward. So if you have a Concord vine in your backyard that you love, we want to use you as a visual while we make that case! DM me a photo of you standing next to your vine, and we'll give you a shoutout in the credits. We'd love to show your vine off!

managing the tasting room during coronavirus,"managing the tasting room during coronavirus I had the protocol of one local winery dropped in my inbox this morning, and there's some good tips here.  One tasting room in my area has closed down until this all blows over.  Disclaimer, I'm not responsible for any other business, you have to do what works for you and use your best judgment, etc.

Here's something that was dropped in my inbox this morning:

1.  Each patron, or pair of patrons, gets their own menu.  We encourage them to take it with t hem or we throw it away after they have touched it.  We don't reuse them; ink is cheap.

2.  We h ave done away with having crackers on the counter, as well as leaving pens/pencils out.  They are available if patrons ask for them.

3.  Hand sanitizer dispensers and facial tissue are readily accessible to patrons and staff.

4.  As frequently as possible, staff are asked to wipe down the counter top, door handles, and other touch points.

5.  Staff are asked to wash their hands after handling credit cards and particularly after handling cash.

6.  Hand washing the glasses of a sick person could expose staff.  Staff are asked to use latex gloves during the hand washing process, then throwing the gloves away.

7.  The tablet screens we use as our POS are recognized as a potential point of contagion since so many people handle them.  Excessively disinfecting them may ultimately damage the surface.  Customers and staff are encouraged to sanitize before and after using them.

8.  Staff are encouraged to stand toward the back of the work space behind the counter as much as possible.",winemaking

Long time homebrew.. wine making racking?,Long time homebrew.. wine making racking? I've brewed beer for about 10 years and want to get my brother a wine making set up for his 30th birthday. I have some things I don't use much including and 6.5 and 5 gallon carboy that I would add to what I buy. I'm trying to research the process so I can set him up for success. Is it standard process to rack 4+ times with wine making? Would having only one  5 gallon carboy make things obnoxious? I assume once primary was done in the 6.5 then transferred to the 5 gallon you wouldn't want to transfer back to the 6.5 because of head space. Secondary fermentation is rarely done with beer making but I know wine making is not apples to apples and having an extra 5 gallon carboy may be more important.,winemaking

Does this look infected?,"Does this look infected? Hi all,  

So I've recently pulled out a couple of leftover [bottles of liquorice wine I made last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/akgnub/liquorice_wine_update/) and they're looking a bit funky. I'm not sure if this just needs a much better racking procedure next time or if I'm harboring some new life forms I shouldn't be.  

The bottles have been corked and in a wine rack for a while, unopened, but the corks are pushed in by hand rather than machine so I'm not sure how tight they really are. They used to be all-brown but this one now has a weird black line running through it. One of the bottles actually had a bit of fur on the outside, but I couldn't see if it'd wormed its way in!  

The worrying part is the hefty amount of blackish brown crud that's taken residence. When I originally racked this wine it was only a standard affair of light brownish dusty stuff. As the bottles have been laying down rather than stood upright, I put this one upright to see if the crud would settle.  

What d'you reckon? Safe to drink still? I've got lots of spare bottles I can siphon it into but I'll gain some headspace, or I've got a spare mini-keg I can dump them all into if needed!

I have a few questions about first-time winemaking,"I have a few questions about first-time winemaking My house has a few grape vines growing in the backyard and I was able to harvest a small amount of purple wine grapes (2-3 shopping bags) and a larger amount of table grapes (white and purple). 
I'm not able to process them further for a while so I've put them all in the freezer. 

My questions are:

1. How scrupulous do I need to clean/pick through them? I've already gone over them fairly well, picking out any old/dried grapes, but have left them on the stems for now. I have campden tablets but I didn't know if I had to be utterly scrupulous in picking out bad grapes or just do it fairly well.

2.  I plan to make grappa from the table grapes, so from reading I thought I would make a small batch of wine with the wine grapes, mash and press, and then mash the table grapes and ferment them with the pressed material from the wine grapes and then distill. Is that correct?

3. Finally how long does it take for grape vines to become fruit bearing? I have been able to grow cuttings by submerging vine runners in soil to grow roots and then transplanting them - how long will they take to bear fruit, and is there any way I can help speed their growth?",winemaking
Questions about bottling cold crashing and pasteurization.,"Questions about bottling cold crashing and pasteurization. So I just finished bottling a wine I had cold crashed for a week to get all the sediment at the bottom. However I realized after I finished corking them that there might be some problems storing the bottles at room temperature because I bottled while it was still cold. It's only the second wine I have made and I made some begginer mistakes that lead to it being very sweet (1.08 FG) and low ABV. (More info at the end)

My question is:
Is it safe to store these bottles at room temperature? I bottled straight out of the fridge and while I'm sure I kept the majority of the yeast out, I'm unsure whether or not it is safe to leave the wine at room temperature in case any yeast warm up and become active again. I only left about half an inch between the bottom of the cork and the wine when I bottled so I'm not exactly sure how much the yeast could actually start to ferment again with that little oxygen.

On another note, could I kill the yeast by pasteurizing the bottles in hot water (150 degrees for 10 minutes) safely due to the difference in temperature (the wine was racked straight out of cold crashing so it is fairly cold)?

I'm not exactly sure where to go from here or how to ensure the yeast don't start fermenting again without storing in the fridge. I would like to age at room temperature if possible. Is it safe to do either of the things I mentioned about without a risk of exploding bottles?

Some other information:
The yeast I used was fleischmann's dry yeast
OG was 1.134
FG was 1.08 for 2 consecutive weeks before bottling",winemaking

MALOLACTIC FERMENTATION - is it to late after few months,"MALOLACTIC FERMENTATION - is it to late after few months Hello,  
I'm making my first wine from polish grapes after really hot summer. Those grapes were industrial and had a big seed and thick skin. Fruits were pretty sour but judging by polish standards not too much.   
For fermentation I used S.cerevisiae bayanus 7 grams yeast. Sanitized everything with potassium sulfate and added about 1.5 grams of it to my 15 liter grape jucie. I've left skins and seeds to ferment in my plastic fermentor box for about 1.5 weeks. After that I've strained my juice out of seed and skins added about 2 kilograms of sugar (I don't trust polish grapes in terms of sugar) for higher alcohol content and left it to finish fermentation. I kind of forgot about it and here I am after about 4/5 months later.  
My wine is pretty sour and has strong alcoholic smell. It's pretty good tho after transferring wine must from plastic container to glass balloon. I guess it just needed to oxidize and vaporize alcohol but still I wonder if I should add a little bit of  calcium carbonate to  precipitate some of acidic taste or maybe add some of the lactic acid bacteria for malolactic fermentation.

"Questions regarding a wine made from syrup, possible pectin and splenda in it?","Questions regarding a wine made from syrup, possible pectin and splenda in it? The story:  
I'm a relatively new brewer,  and I largely make ciders and soda by the gallon, with my eye on moving into mead making. Soon I plan on moving up to a 8 gallon conical set up, but for now I just use glass carboys.  I have rarely made wines or beers, as I find pleasure in a dry, still apple cider.  Nothing complicated.   
I  had an empty 1 gal carboy after racking my cider and instead of using it to make a ginger ale or  'rude' beer like I usually do, I decided to make a wine . This was not a planned brew, just sort of an impulse on the day I racked the cider. My  base for the brew was a pint of chokecherry syrup that my grandma had made +  enough sugar to bring the OG up to 1.135, as well as just a tsp of almond extract for a light nutty note. The wort was, quite frankly, delicious.  I pitched a slightly expired champagne yeast, which went into action quickly and happily.  I did not take into consideration that my grandma may put pectin and artificial sweetener (almost certainly splenda, knowing my Gma) into her syrups, though I suspect that might be the case now.   


I pitched on Jan 28, its now March 2... so  tomorrow will be 5 weeks in primary fermentation. The shelf it ferments on sits at a fairly stable 70 degrees F, though it does get about 2 hours of sun exposure in the aftrernoon if I accidentally leave the curtains open in my brew room. There is still action going on and carbonation happening, and my gravity is down to 1.060, and the wine is still very sweet, cloudy and has a thick mouth feel.  I had been waiting to see action stop before taking a gravity reading, so this reading of 1.060 is my first reading.  It has a strange, rather chemically note to the nose but not of sulphur or like any spoilage. Not chlorine like, or acetone like, or vinegar like. I'm trying to put my finger on it, but I'm not sure what it is exactly. It could, in my mind, simply be a mash up of the almond, ethanol and artificial sweetners in a boquet I am just simply unaccostomed to.  
I haven't been able to get ahold of grandma for her syrup recipe yet, but once I do, it will shed some light on this for me.  I'm almost certain, though, that she has added pectin to the syrup as a thickener (Jelly and syrup get made on the same day in her kitchen.  I don't add pectin to my syrups, personally.)   


I've been doing some reading and have determined that adding pectin enzyme at this point would be BAD because it would drop all the pectin out into methanol and \*potentially\*  making it poisonous, while leaving the pectin in suspension will just keep it cloudy and thick to the mouth., but not poisonous.  My reading on artificial sweeteners added to wine has led me to a bit of a dead end, however, as most of what I have read refers to adding it as a back-sweetener.  I am concerned that there may be unwanted byproducts from fermenting on the artificial sweeteners.   


so my questions:  
1) Should I continue this wine, or pitch it  to the  gutter as a failed experiment with no real lessons learned?   
2) What do we know about fermenting on top of artificial sweeteners?  
3)  I am scared of methanol, someone hold me. What do I do?

First batch extremely tart,"First batch extremely tart Hi everyone,

I want to start off by saying I have very little knowledge about winemaking.  I come from an extensive homebrewing background and when a family member called me and said he had 20 pounds of fresh grapes for me to experiment with, I couldn't say no to talking a shot at making my first batch of wine.  
After some light reading, I got the idea of how to make wine and just went at it.  Squeezed the juice, added yeast nutrient and yeast, fermented for about 2 months and then bottled.  I back sweetened half of the batch and left half as is.  

My first issue is that I didnt successfully kill the yeast in my back sweetened bottles, leading to sparking wine.

If it doesn‚Äôt ferment out as high as I‚Äôd like would it be able to be reinoculated with a more hardy yeast and maintain the banana character from the hefe yeast through the end of fermentation?

Hot Clinates,"Hot Clinates Hey folks, I‚Äôm looking at getting into winemaking but I‚Äôm worried about doing it in the climate I live in. I‚Äôm in Florida, where the temperature can easily reach 100 degrees F in the summer quite often. Even now, in the winter, we have days between 60-80.

Grapes in Switzerland,"Grapes in Switzerland Hi guys,

I've been a wine lover for years now and have always dreamed of making my own.However, where I live, close to a wine region in Switzerland, I can't seem to find any information regarding purchasing fresh grapes from wineries nearby. So I'm wondering if anybody here knows a place I could visit or somebody I could contact who could help out.

Also, is this a common issue for new vintners or did most of you have immediate access to some fresh grapes when you got started? I'm not against starting with a kit with wine juice to learn the ropes, but knowing myself, I'll want to make the jump to fresh grapes ASAP.

A question about N2O and wine,"A question about N2O and wine I admit this is a strange question.

I make clarified milk punches as a hobby. Milk punches are cocktails clarified through milk curdling. By curdling milk with an acidic, and then straining the drink back through the curds, you can achieve crystal-clear drinks. The casein curds act as a filter, catching all the particles and compounds that defract light in a cocktail. The curds also bond with the enzymes in citrus juices that create bitter-tasting limonoids, meaning that the finished cocktail is shelf-stable and can be stored for years just like wine.

Many milk punches use bases of port or even red wine. I develop new recipes based on existing cocktails and fit them into my milk punch template so I can bottle them and store them. Most recently I thought it would be fun to turn a Kalimotxo (a casual Spanish drink of equal parts red wine and Coca-Cola) into a milk punch. I used all-natural root beer, red wine, port, armagnac, lemon juice, overproof rum, and black tea. The filtration worked; it's crystal clear. It's a little thinner in the mouthfeel than most milk punches I make, because usually they're higher ABV and contain liqueurs, and that thickens them up. This one is about 14% and no liqueur added. So to compensate for this thin mouthfeel, I'd like to keg the drink in a cold-brew system and gas it with nitrogen or nitrous oxide (N2O).

I know nitrogen would be inert in reaction to everything in the drink, but I know nitrous oxide would give me a beautiful creamy head because of the dairy fats and surfactant proteins that are still in the finished drink.

But will the nitrous oxide oxidize the wine base of my drink? 

Thank you for your help.",winemaking
Signs of an unsafe batch?,"Signs of an unsafe batch? Hey everyone, beginner here- just started my first real batch a couple days ago.

Airlock activity: How slow is slow enough to be considered at the end of fermentation so we can rack?,"Airlock activity: How slow is slow enough to be considered at the end of fermentation so we can rack? We're making a 5 gallon batch of blueberry wine for the 4th time. We used 15lbs of frozen then blended berries, 12 lbs of sugar, all the other good stuff and a package of EC-1118 yeast. Fermentation has slowed down to a bubble every 45-50 seconds 19 days after fermentation became active, 21 days after we started the batch.

Is there a point where slow enough is good enough or must there be no fermentation activity? We've always erred on the side of caution and let is sit at least 2-5 days with no or near zero bubbling activity 1) to make sure the process has stopped and 2) so we can rack on a weekend when we have time to enjoy the process. We have had generally good wine outcomes but there was one time we let is sit well over a month beyond the end of fermentation bc we didn't make time to rack and it seemed to make the wine come out ""heavier"" as my wife describes it so we don't want to go to there again. This time we want a ""lighter"", drier wine so we want to time racking more closely to ""the perfect time"" and will also be reducing the amount of back sweetening to 1 - 2 cups of dissolved sugar for the batch before bottling.

Does letting it sit in the fermenter for a longer period after fermentation stops help, hurt or makes no difference to the final outcome? We're looking to fine tune the process for a more consistent outcome.

Another reason we want to get to the racking phase without waiting extra, unnecessary days is so we can get a fresh batch started. We have some spring/summer events coming up for which we'd like to have a good supply of wine but definitely don't want to ruin anything by hurrying.",winemaking

Finnish sugar wine recipe,"Finnish sugar wine recipe This is the most basic alcohol recipe. It will yield you around 3 liters or 0.8 gallons. I‚Äôve heard it is popular in the Finnish punk rock scene.
This is based of a recipe I got from the daily nexus I think.

Equipment/ ingredients
3.5 cups of pure cane sugar
Packet of yeast
Gallon milk or water jug
Tap water
Balloon

Optional: 
Filter
Funnel

steps:
1.  Put the sugar and yeast into the gallon jug

2. Add water up until about 2 inches from the top.

3. Screw on the cap and shake.

4. Take off the cap and put a balloon over the cap with a hole in it.

5. Let it ferment for around 2 weeks. If you wanted it carbonated, screw on the cap after 2 weeks but be weary it may ‚Äúexplode‚Äù.

6. (Optional). You want to filter it so you don‚Äôt have the yeast in the final product. Just filter it through something like a coffee filter of thin piece of cloth. Either will do the trick.

Notes:
Adding small amounts of sugar throughout the fermentation process will increase its ABV. 

The balloon is to keep oxygen out so the yeast anaerobically respirates. If you do this wrong it can result in your just making some vinegar.

From what I‚Äôve heard the ABV is around 15-20% 
depending on if you add sugar during the fermentation and what yeast you use.  

The taste is not very good so if you‚Äôre looking for a good tasting alcohol this is not the recipe.

Experienced home brewer looking for an evaluation of my first wine process,"Experienced home brewer looking for an evaluation of my first wine process Hey all,

I‚Äôm going to start my first wine kit after a few years of home brewing. I‚Äôd just like to make sure I‚Äôm thinking about things correctly. 

I‚Äôm using the Cellar Craft old vine Zinfandel kit FYI. I believe it is 18L of juice and skins. 

1. I‚Äôm thinking about using my spike flex 7 gallon stainless fermenter for primary. It suggests a 7.9 gallon fermenter. Will this be a problem?

2. I will then rack to a 5 gallon carboy for secondary whenever it is ready. At this point I know your wisdom outranks the wine kit instructions. Should I leave it in the secondary for a few weeks and then rack to another carboy to age? Should I leave it in secondary for a few months and then rack to age? I‚Äôm unsure about the post primary to bottling process and what is considered best practice. 

3. When should I use an airlock after primary? When should I use a bung? As far as using an airlock, it will be with my brew stuff so I‚Äôll be able to monitor the water level often enough that it won‚Äôt go dry. 

4. I keep seeing a sulphate solution for sanitizing. Can I just use star San or is there a reason they all suggest using this? 

I guess my main concerns won‚Äôt creep up for another few weeks. I‚Äôll be starting fermentation this week and then doing the first rack to secondary.....whenever it is best I suppose. Should I wait for terminal gravity in primary if I am planning on aging it for around a year or rack to secondary with some points to spare?

Wine From Mushrooms,"Wine From Mushrooms First off, no I'm not talking about that recipe where you basically just add mushroom flavoring to some kind of marmite mixture and ferment it. Rather, I'm talking about the process outlined in this link: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1271/bbb.65.1596](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1271/bbb.65.1596)   


Now I'm not very good at reading papers like these, and from what I can tell the primary point of their experiments were to check concentrations of chemicals with health benefits, but I'm more interested in the fact that, apparently, mushrooms can function in place of proper wine yeast. It's very interesting to me as I am a hopeful mushroom farmer and I'm looking for potential products to process excess crop into. In fact, it's so interesting that I'm considering it in-spite of my complete inexperience with wine.  


The thing is, I can't find much information on it, anywhere. Including this subreddit or subreddits specifically dealing with mushrooms or mushroom products. As far as I can tell, like five other people have considered this on a single topic in an obscure and defunct forum about homebrewing. Because of this, I imagine that no one here is going to be able to walk me through a process, so instead I'll be figuring that stuff out on my own.  


The reason I made this post was to ask several specific questions of which I am finding it very difficult to answer.  


1. What is the startup cost of a winery that does not use grapes? Everything I can find on the internet starts off with stuff about how expensive the land is, and I have no idea what parts of their expenses include land/grape associated costs, so combing that out from the data has proven difficult.  

2. If I just wanted to ferment some sugar water in a bucket, how would the ratio of sugar to yeast and the absolute amounts of both affect the resulting sugar-water ""wine""? Mushrooms don't have a lot of carbohydrates, so I will have to add basically all the sugar myself. I have no idea how much mushroom I should add comparative to how much sugar, but that's not something I can imagine anyone answering. Instead I'll just be adding different amounts of each and comparing the results to the aforementioned sugar water wine to get a sort of idea.  

3. How long would such a concoction actually take to reach 'maturity', since the flavor doesn't really have to seep in gradually from a barrel or wood chips or grapes or what have you? Of course, the time will be different with mushrooms, but having a baseline to know when the mushrooms are changing the flavor and the mixture is actually fermented would be helpful.  

4. If you were at a grocery store or had the opportunity to try such a wine at some kind of meetup, would you do so? This is not an offer, but rather a survey for actual wine drinkers. I need to know how much of a market I can expect, and basically the only thing I can really do is ask people.  


As you can see, these questions are very specific to very niche circumstances, so finding answers on my own would be difficult to impossible. Nobody is going around making flavorless sugar water wine except in maybe some kind of laboratory, and there's not really a such thing as a winery with no way to source grapes, except for those 'vineyard-less' labels that basically just do everything for you, and that's way on the other end of the scale.  


I'm mostly interested in this because of the degree of control I can have over mushrooms compared to grapes. Grape flavored wine depends on soil contents, climate, the exact type of grape, etc, which is all dependent on where you grow them, but my mushrooms will be grown inside a controlled environment and will have little genetic drift between crops. I can control humidity, heat, oxygen, the substrate they are grown on, etc, so I can get the same exact flavor every single time. Also you can grow like a hundred pounds a week in less than a hundred square feet of space, so my 'vineyard' can be anywhere I want it to be.  


If I'm correct, then this would reduce cost dramatically, as despite the costs of mushrooms per pound (Oysters are about $10-15 a pound fresh) a vineyard still sounds dramatically more expensive. Theoretically, I could make a rather high quality wine for a relatively low cost (I sincerely doubt I can out compete two buck chuck so cheap wine isn't an option, and mushrooms won't have the prestige to make it in the dramatically expensive price range).  


Anyway, I need to actually crunch those numbers later, and really I can't be certain until I do so, but even if it doesn't turn out to be a viable business, I'm still gonna make some mushroom wine. I got a chef friend whose really interested in checking the flavor it adds when cooking...  


As far as the other questions about wine making, that info is plentiful enough. That being said, the process may turn out to be an entirely different beast than I first thought, so it will necessitate experimentation. But that's fun part right?",winemaking
Persimmon Wine - Salvageable?,"Persimmon Wine - Salvageable? At the end of the persimmon season I had a couple dozen pounds of persimmons. I knew we couldn't eat them fast enough so I decided to make persimmon wine with them.  I'm more of a homebrewer and this is my first time attempting a wine.

I screwed up my hydrometer reading because the added sugar wasn't homogenous in the bucket after adding it and I ended up adding too much.  When I racked it to the secondary, there was a bunch of sugar just sitting at the bottom. 

When I tasted it at 2 weeks, it was absolutely awful. It tasted super boozy and really sulfurous.  I gave it more time to finish fermenting since I was still seeing some yeast activity. 

After a couple more weeks, I degassed it and moved it to another container.  Still tasted pretty bad. 

I let it rest another 4 weeks or so, and it was still pretty awful and sulfurous.  I didn't get around to pouring it out, and it's been about another 4 weeks.  I figured I would pour it out today, but I wanted to taste it first and it turns out that it is significantly less awful. The booziness seems much more balanced, I can get some of the sweetness coming through, but there's still a little bit of sulfurous flavor coming through. 

If I continue to let it rest, can I expect the sulfurous flavors to diminish further?  I degassed it again today in case that's what had helped. Anything else I ought to do?  Should I bottle it and let it rest awhile or wait first?

I originally thought the experiment was a total disaster, but it seems like it might be possible to recover now.",winemaking

1 Gallon Batch - First Timer Goes Au Natural,"1 Gallon Batch - First Timer Goes Au Natural Hey all, couples of quick questions regarding general process for an as natural wine as possible.

I‚Äôve never made wine before and last week I had a natural wine that blew my mind. I do t expect anything I make to be that good, but it would be fun to throw some fruit in a bucket and see what happens.

If I want to make a gallon of wine from fruits I can get at the supermarket, how much will I need and is it essential to add water to reach final volume? I read some conflicting reports and recipes, and was hoping for some clarification. Some said 3-5lbs for a gallon of wine, but surely that doesn‚Äôt give enough liquid?

Speaking of fruits, I get that I should find the best fruits I can, and I was thinking to get grapes and/or mix it with some berries. Is there any thing you‚Äôd specifically avoid? 

Last one: for natural fermentation, will it work with supermarket fruits if they‚Äôve been washed? Or will yeast be essential? If I can avoid tabbing Campden Tablets and yeast that‚Äôd be nice, but if it is generally accepted that the wine would be shit without it, I‚Äôm happy to try.

Questions on Elderflower Wine,"Questions on Elderflower Wine I am looking to make a elderflower wine, but since I don't live anywhere near Britain or anywhere that these flowers grow naturally I cannot use fresh flowers. I have done a bit of research on using dried elderflower (of which I already have roughly half a pound), but the only resource I could find was two or three recipes posted on other forums. They all use around 5-15 grams of dried elderflower for a full gallon, but most recipes using fresh use a litre of flower heads if not more for a gallon which doesn't seem quite right so I feel like I'm missing something. So I guess my questions are:

1. How much should I actually use of dried elderflower in a recipe for a gallon?
2. How does the recipe change if the dried elderflower is from a loose leaf tea, compared to pure dried elderflower (for reference this is what I have on hand: [Elderflower Herbal Tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJZCCMW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1))

2nd year of Winemaking,"2nd year of Winemaking Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I started making wine in 2018 with my friend. We only made two batches of Merlot, the first one was made in 2018, and we bought around 300 kilos of Merlot, made the ""selection"" of all grapes individually (everything is easier when friends are there), and we received around 90 liters of lovely wine. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2019 we raised the cap to 500kg, but we ended with bringing back around 600kg (it was a very good year with sugars in grapes around 25% shown on Refractometer). 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem started when we noticed that we needed one more barrel to store the extra wine because the 200-liter barrel from 2018 was not enough. So we went to a local INOX producer and bought a smaller one with a 140-liter capacity to fill it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to get to the point...

&amp;#x200B;

I went one day to check the progress and noticed something that looks like rust, in small circles around the rim and some dots on the ""floating cap"", i will show in pictures. I immediately cleared every dot with paper and scratched it a bit to get it off. Then i contacted a friend of mine who is making wine also, and he told me that is because we put too much Potassium on the cap (we use it as a blocker for air), we did one bag of 10g, but after that, we used like 1-2 grams exchanging it every seven days. The dots stopped appearing, but there are some still left.

Banana Brett Wine Tasting Notes,"Banana Brett Wine Tasting Notes This Homemade Backwoods Banana Brett Wine Recipe was a complete experiment and turned out to be one of the best fruit wines I have ever made. The banana comes through both on the nose and on the tongue. This is complimented by pineapple, a light 'breadyness' and vanilla. I added the oak chips without sanitizing them and I believe this introduced malolactic bacteria which gave the wine an amazing mouth feel, similar to a chardonnay. The Funky Brett character is not quite there yet but has added perhaps a little more acidity.

Oxygen exposure while de-gassing,"Oxygen exposure while de-gassing I have a de-gassing drill attachment and while the kit directions say it should take 2-4 minutes at medium speed, even after 15 minutes it still seems like CO2 is coming out of solution.

How much of a risk is oxygen exposure at this point? This is 14 days into fermentation, near the FG target. I'm planning to age the wine for 6-12 months minimum so will be adding metabisulphites.

Is the thinking that by releasing CO2, there's a blanket of it between the wine and O2 so vigorous stirring isn't super risky, though one shouldn't splash or agitate more than is necessary?

Thanks in advance!",winemaking
Problem with CO2 in the finished wine. What did I do wrong?,"Problem with CO2 in the finished wine. What did I do wrong? I had a little problem with my last red wine. The taste is amazing but when I pour the wine in the glass we can notice a tiny ammount of gas and if we look closely we can see very tiny bubles in the wine. In the mouth the first thing that can be noted is a tiny peak of gas.
If we let the wine breath for some minutes this sensation gets less noticeable, but it stays there either way. 
What went wrong?

This wine was made inside Inox Vats and went directly to the bottle without going trough barrels. And that is why I am question the importance of barrels and amphoras because they allow micro-oxigenation, and Inox vats don¬¥t. Could it be that the problem?

Efficient Natural Wine Fermentation Tricks?,"Efficient Natural Wine Fermentation Tricks? I am trying to understand how to bring the best efficiency to my wine fermentations. I deal with only wild yeasts and absolutely no additives. Someone told me I should rack the wine at the middle of the fermentation because the lees contains harmfull substances that will slow down or even stop the work of the yeasts.  Does anyone know any science that can share to corroborate this statement? What substances are we talking about?

The thing is I m having troubles to complete the fermentation of all the sugars, so I need to know the best tricks to put yeasts working the best way they can. I also don¬¥t want to do temperature control, I have a nice cool winery, and the temeprature of the fermentations is usualy between 18C and 22C  . And speaking about sugars, how much is the ideal limit of residual sugars to have a nice wine?  

I also know that I need to pick the grapes earlier because high sugar content also doesn¬¥t allow yeasts to work very well.

Pinot noir questions,"Pinot noir questions I‚Äôm attempting a batch of Pinot noir. Currently it has a lovely deep purplish red color and a nice sweet flavor. I have three questions that I would love feedback on. Sorry if they‚Äôre a bit newbyish. I‚Äôm pretty new to all this. The first has to do with fermentation.

1. Starting S.G. was 1.070. Fermentation stopped at 1.006. I added some water and yeast nutrient but nothing is happening. Do I need to get it in the 900s or can I call it good?

2. I noticed when I first drink it that it gives me a very slight headache. I‚Äôve read this can come from tannins in the grape skins. All the grapes were removed after primary fermentation and as of the last racking, there is no must at all. Is there anything I can do to counteract this?

First racking / filtering ... siphoning and mechanical filtering ?,"First racking / filtering ... siphoning and mechanical filtering ? On October 25 of 2019 we pressed our pinot noir off the skins and added the malo bacteria (and some malo food).  We filled the (small) headspace in our stainless bucket with co2 and sealed things shut.

A month or so ago I took samples and sent them to a lab and they said:

""Your pH is a little on the high side; however your Titratable Acidity (TA) is about normal.""

""The level of malic acid in your wine is 0 g/L, which means it has completed its fermentation and is considered dry. The secondary fermentation is when malolactic bacteria coverts malic acid to lactic acid. At this point, I would recommend racking your wine, making any acid adjustments and sulfuring it.""

""Yes, your wine is done with malolactic fermentation. As for your sulfur addition, I would recommend making a 50 ppm addition.""

&amp;#x200B;

So ... a little bit too basic (slightly high ph) but malo is finished, and we have close to 14% alcohol.

We're new to this so I am not going to get complicated with fiddling with the PH level and so on ... I just want to rack the wine, add the 50 ppm sulfur, and then close it back up in the oxygen-free stainless for another 6 months (?)

The questions are:

1. How do I move the wine from one stainless bucket (no spout/spigot) to another ?  I assume I need to siphon it, which I can do, I just wonder how to minimize oxygen content during the siphoning process ?

2. I'm not going to do the egg thing.  I assume a lot of solids are sitting at the bottom of our stainless bucket ... so as long as I don't siphon those up, can I just run the wine through a coffee filter and call it a day ?  I rather like the idea of using a mechanical filter to fine the wine rather than egg whites...

I forgot to put sulfites in it so it's certainly oxidized a bit. 

Last time I sampled it it smelled very sweet and pleasant but the taste didn't match. Wasn't vinegar but wasn't as pleasant as it has been months earlier. The question is, can i/should I back-sweeten it to make it my palatable? Can I salvage it by turning it into a port at this stage by fortifying it?

Chaptalization: sweet wine with low gravity?,"Chaptalization: sweet wine with low gravity? Hi folks.  I have been making wine for a few years now at home and so far haven't come across any major issues.  This latest batch however has been problematic, and happened to be my first time at chaptalization, so I was hoping someone could help point out where I went wrong.

I have two 5G batches of red: Montepulciano and Pinot Noir purchased as juice back in October.

**First the Monte:**

\- Started as 1.087 / 21 Brix / 11.3 potential ABV  
\- Added 1lb 11oz sugar to target &gt; 13 ABV  
\- Adding sugar resulted in 1.100 / 23.7 Brix / \~13.5 PABV

Kicked off primary (Lalvin RC212, 16% tolerance), and it quickly went down to 1.014.  Moved to secondary, and there it stayed for weeks with extremely slow progress.  Now here we are in January, and a measurement yesterday showed 0.097 / 13.5% ABV.  The wine while tastes great, yet is still pretty sweet to me.  I've never had a fermentation go below 0.096, and they've never tasted sweet like this one.  I usually like dry wines, and while I admittedly don't have a great palate, I convinced myself it was more fruity than sweet (though the wife disagreed with me), but went ahead and stabilized the wine.  My Dad likes sweeter wines anyway.

**As for the Pinot:**

\- Started at 1.088 / 21 Brix / 11.4 PABV  
\- Added 2 lb 13oz sugar to target &gt; 14 ABV  
\- Adding sugar resulted in 1.110 / 25.8 Brix / 14.3 PABV

Kicked off the primary with the same yeast, but here we are 11 weeks later and it's still hovering at 1.002, and not surprisingly, tasted very sweet.  I moved it to warmer part of the house and may try pitching a higher tolerance yeast and/or yeast energizer.  I'm going to hold off on stabilizing this one until I try a few more things.

So I know I likely had a slow/stuck fermentation in both cases, but in the case of the Montepulciano, the gravity now sits at 0.097, yet is fairly sweet.  Is this something that is normal when adding sugar?  Everything I've read up until now says &lt; 1.000 should be a dry wine. What FG should I be looking at for a dry wine then?  0.096 has typically been my ending point, and I always ferment in the same location in my house, where fermentations have always been done in roughly three weeks.",winemaking

Going to try Homemade Fruit Wine,"Going to try Homemade Fruit Wine I have been making beer for a few years now, and yesterday looked into making some Banana and Blackberry wine, which I hope to do this weekend.

There are some steps in the process I read about that seem weird, coming from a brewing background. Since they're from less-than-reputable recipe websites, I wanted to check to see if they are really necessary/correct steps, or if I can skip them. Could you please help me out?

1. During the initial 1 week fermentation (when fruit is still in the fermenter) they say to stir it every day. I thought this would be horrible to introduce oxygen at this time, and always potential for bugs.

2. After the 1 week initial ferment, it says to move to a secondary for 3 months or so, and then into another fermenter for another 3-6 months. Is there anything wrong with just leaving it in the same secondary? Again I don't want to needlessly introduce more oxygen or bugs. Or extra work... this seems really silly to me especially when it's off the main part of the yeast from the first week of fermenting.

3. Do you bother with gravity readings at the end of fermentation to make sure it is finished, or is it just going to be definitely 100% done after 6 months? (I assume the latter...)

4. How important is temperature during each step of fermentation? I *can* put fermenters in my beer fermenting fridge for the first week, but would rather not just because it's full of beer... after that I'd have to leave it in (Australian) room temps, between 15-25c usually.",winemaking

Help finishing spiced pumpkin wine,"Help finishing spiced pumpkin wine Help! I could use some ideas. I have a spiced pumpkin wine that I can‚Äôt seem to get below 1.018 gravity (1.122 OG). I mean it‚Äôs already at 13.65%, which is great, but it‚Äôs super sweet to taste still. Nice flavor, but very sweet. More than a dessert wine, which is not what I want. Definitely was hoping for something drier. I have two gallons each in a 1 gal carboy, racked twice so far. Starting to get decently clear, still some floaters. I‚Äôve hit it with nutrient twice in the past month, as well as nutrient at pitch. It‚Äôs 2 months old as of today. I used K1-V1116.

Everything I‚Äôve made in the last year has fermented dry within 3-4 weeks, if not sooner using both K1-V1116 and EC-1118. Temperature stays consistent at about 64 F. 

I‚Äôve brought these upstairs and wrapped in towel to try and warm them up a bit and see if I can wake some yeasties up. I don‚Äôt mind a little sweet with this, but I‚Äôd love to dry it out and get it closer to 1.000g. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, recipe was about 6 cups of sugar pumpkin, lots of brown sugar as fermentable base, cinnamon, nutmeg, fresh ginger, handful of raisins. 3 gallons at pitch, but the pumpkin left a lot of lees, and Ive lost 3/4 gallon just from racking. Did I lose most of the yeast from racking? Not much trub left as of now. Should I try to pitch some high tolerance yeast to try to finish it off?

Primary Fermentation Advice,"Primary Fermentation Advice Need some brainstorming help. I started a 5-gallon batch of blueberry wine on Friday. I followed the recipe to a T, added campden tablets Friday afternoon, and didn't add yeast until Saturday afternoon, over 24 hours later. By Sunday afternoon (another 24 hours), no fermentation had started. I read somewhere that air can help move things along, so I took the airlock out of the bucket lid to give it a bit of air flow while still protecting most of it.

Monday morning, still no signs of any fermentation. I figured maybe I had a bad batch of yeast, or my bucket maybe has more than 5 gallons of liquid and those packets are only good up to 5 gallons, or campden didn't have enough time to do its thing and killed the yeast, I don't know, so I added another packet (this time soaking it in warm water for several minutes before stirring it in).

Not looking for medical advice (obvious advice is 'avoid red wine'). I just don't understand how fermenting with skins can impart compounds so different &amp; I'm curious as to how &amp; what those are.*

Red wine (and tawny port) makes me break out in hives on my thighs and shoulders; white wine (and white port) goes fine.

I thought the only difference between red wine and white wine was that red wine does the first round of fermentation with the skins on (?). **My question is what compounds the skins add to red wine, how are they imparted, and is there a difference in making red wine *besides* just using the skins? Like, are different things added in the processing?** 

- For example, how does the tannin get from the skins to the wine? Is it just like coffee or tea, ""if you soak grapes in water for long enough, tiny molecular pieces of the grape skins go into the wine""? But then, how is the wine clear? I read that pectin makes wine cloudy &amp; so adding pectic enzyme clears it up, but wouldn't clearing the wine require removing all the red molecular bits, too? 

- I read about anthocyanins, but don't really understand that; is it like tannins where it just kind of diffuses from the skins? How do anthocyanins &amp; tannins separate from the skin? 

- Are sulfites only in red wine and not white wine? Where do those come from?

- What else is there? What's added specifically to red?

- Do different grapes have different amounts of the compounds/chemicals? E.g. I think Malbec has much more tannin than Merlot. What about the other compounds/chemicals?

Thanks!

pH measurement during primary fermentation: is your winery doing it?,"pH measurement during primary fermentation: is your winery doing it? Love to hear thoughts!   


Over the past 2 years I have had conversations with over 100 wineries and winemakers about what attributes are important to measure in the primary fermentation process. Most attributes are widely agreed. Sugar being the most universal (although in different units and methods). Temperature being a no brainer. Some other interesting ones like volume, sulphur, CO2, oxygen‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääright through to a request to build an artificial nose! One of the measurements commands debate higher than others though, and that is pH. Measuring pH levels seems to be a divider in the winemaking community in terms of how useful it is or is not. Is your winery measuring pH daily in primary fermentation? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on why or why not‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähere is some thoughts I have compiled based on our conversations with winemakers.

A wines pH levels is an important thing to keep a close eye on during harvest and in the winemaking process. It greatly affects the flavor, ability to age, and overall balance of the wine. The pH levels in wines often differentiates a mediocre wine to a premium one.

Most wines fall between 3.2‚Äì3.6 on the pH scale. Grapes lose acid as the fruit ages on the vine, making it pertinent to pick the grapes when the pH, sugar levels, and tannins are at prime levels.

**Why is it important to track the pH levels daily?**

You want to track the pH daily, because the acidity levels impact every aspect of your wine. Flavor, aroma, color, carbon dioxide absorption, malolactic fermentation, ability to age, mouthfeel, and fermentation rate. It can also influence the chemical reaction after the fermentation process is complete.

Acidity levels should be monitored regularly throughout the grape growing process and then monitored on a daily basis as harvest gets nearer. These daily trackings should continue throughout the winemaking process.

Wines with too low of pH will be flabby, lacking mouthfeel and flavor. Wines that are too high in pH will be overwhelmingly tart, quicken the aging process, and may also affect the wines ability to go through malolactic fermentation which is sensitive to pH levels and SO¬≤ levels.

Having your wines in the correct pH ranges will also ward off bacteria and fungi growth, which can creep up during the winemaking process and create spoilage in the bottle.

**Daily tracking of the pH levels can allow you to moderate pH levels and adjust when needed, before any major problems arise.**

Tracking pH levels enables overall trends to be depicted. This is important as pH works on a logarithmic scale. This means small changes can have big impacts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääparticularly if the trend over time is showing the pH is heading in the wrong direction. For example, our research team examines the formation of some of the onion and chive flavor structures that form towards the end of fermentation as the pH drifts from 3.2 towards 4.

Many winemakers do not measure pH daily during primary fermentation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpreferring instead to take a measurement near the end of the fermentation and correct as and if needed. This is valid. Accurate pH measurements during primary fermentation are difficult and time consuming. There are often more important measurements that need to be done and only so many hours in the day. However, using pH data can offer a lot of insight into wine health and quality.

**pH and its influence on other important wine attributes**

Many of our customers walk us through their process of gathering data and making decisions during primary fermentation. A common practice is to use one attribute to gain many insights into the wine. Using pH to dig into deeper insights is also something winemakers are commonly doing.

For example, using a pH data point a winemaker can explore free and bound sulphur.

With real-time data on pH the winemaker can get insights on many important wine attributes. This is what makes pH levels a king-pin measurement for any winemaker.",winemaking

New Winemaker -- Need Some Advice,"New Winemaker -- Need Some Advice Hey All!
I am a beer homebrewer, now a winemaker! (sort of :P)

My wife got me a winemaking kit for Christmas. It's basically a box with pretty much all you need to start making wine. It also comes with pressed wine juice to jumpstart the process.

Is there any logical reason for this? Again, I come from the Beer world but I was under the impression that red wines need time to age? This wine, specifically, is a Merlot. Why on earth would they recommend that I drink the wine so young?

Does this have to do with the fact that I might not be equipped to properly age wine? I was under the impression that wine would be fine in the bottles for years. But based on what I read from the kit, it will not be.

Shrub maker tries to make a shrub into a wine and could use some advice.,"Shrub maker tries to make a shrub into a wine and could use some advice. Hey all, so recently I decide to ferment a shrub recipe into a wine. I made a double batch of a cherry apple spiced shrub and omitted the vinegar for half of it. Well as it turns out I am kind of into the idea of doing this as a hobby. So in my non scientific throw some yeast into this and see what happens approach I decided to be more hands on. 

So my Specific Gravity reading at the start was 1.120 and after a week of fermentation is 1.080. I racked it into a new vessel and added more yeast.

From the info I can find my sugar is way too high. I also know that I have a diminishing return on the amount of fermentation that can take place. So should I dilute to bring the amount of sugar down or worry about it after fermentation. I'm not really into super sweet things ( I didn't account for the fact that I cut the sweetness with vinegar and use around 2oz at a time of the shrub) so I would rather it be dryer.  Recommendations would be much appreciated.  Thanks.",winemaking

Should I even bother with bottle aging pineapple wine?,"Should I even bother with bottle aging pineapple wine? Hey all, newbie here. Made a batch of pineapple wine that I was very satisfied with and bottled it on 12/9/2019. It came out to just over 11.5% ABV and I was extremely pleased with the flavor. My main question here is, will it actually benefit from being aged in the bottle or should I just enjoy it? I was thinking about keeping a bottle or two in storage to compare the change over time, but as I'm a novice I was wondering if anybody had more professional advice with this kind of wine. The guide I followed to make it suggested letting it sit in the bottle for ""just under a year,"" but also contained numerous errors in sanitizing technique and stuff like that so I'm not sure if I can trust it.

Being my first wine and having read a horrible book on the subject, I made a few mistakes on my first go. I did not take an initial gravity reading and I followed a recipe that didn't mention ever taking a gravity reading!

Anyway, I have a fruit wine now that is stuck at 1.020 and won't budge. I initially pitched the Red Star Pasteur Red yeast recommended by the recipe with the requisite sugar and pounds of fruit. The recipe is listed below for a 5 gallon batch:

\- 20lbs fruit

\- 7.5 lbs sugar

\- 5 cans of white grape juice

\- 5 campden tablet (for clearing according to the recipe)

I followed the recommendations of the recipe and pitched in the crushed campden tablets after the airlock stopped bubbling (I know, terrible advice). Anyway, after waiting another 3 weeks, I tried the wine and it was extremely sweet. By then, I had read a lot on brewing beer and wine, realizing the book/recipe I followed was not very good. I measured the FG and got a reading of 1.020. The wine is extremely sweet (even more than a desert wine I think, but I can taste the alcohol as well). Anyway, I was hoping to dry it out some more, but I can't seem to get the fermentation going again.

 I've tried the following remedies without success:

\- adding yeast nutrient (recommended by my local HBS)

\- changing fermentation temperature

\- pitching in a new batch of yeast (EC-1118)

Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 3,"Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 3 Part 3:

It worked!

Here's a breakdown of the process since the last update:

&amp;#x200B;

11/25 - added LAB to the MLF batch.

11/29 - Took SG readings on both batches: Control - .996, MLF - 1.002

11/30 - Took SG readings on both batches: Control - .994, MLF - .996. 

I also took malic acid readings from both batches and was pleasantly surprised to see that MLF was working: Control - &gt;300 mg/l, MLF &lt;75 mg/l

&amp;#x200B;

12/2 - Took SG readings and racked into 3 gal. carboys: Control - .996, MLF - .993. 

Took malic acid readings: Control - &gt;300 mg/l, MLF - &lt;75 mg/l. 

At this point it seemed that the malic acid conversion was complete so I proceeded with following the kit instructions: Added k-meta, added kieselsol, stirred/degassed. 

The kit wanted me to add k-sorbate but I tossed that package.

&amp;#x200B;

12/3 - Took pH readings: Control - 3.39, MLF - 3.60

At this point we (my wife and I) tasted both batches and there is definitely a difference. The control batch was much more fruit forward and had more of an acidic bite to it. The MLF batch was slightly more bland which I guess is the flabby effect that people keep mentioning.

Even though the MLF batch pH was in an acceptable range, I went ahead and added 15g of tartaric acid to improve the taste.

Added chitosan, added 2oz. oak, stirred/degassed.

&amp;#x200B;

From here I plan to bulk age for about 2 months before bottling. I'll taste test the batches periodically to make sure the oak isn't too strong and give you all updates.

&amp;#x200B;

The picture is from the 12/2 malic acid test.

&amp;#x200B;

3 wines ... stuck at 1.000,"3 wines ... stuck at 1.000 So I have three wines (Chianti, Brunello, Zinfandel) ... and they have all been stuck at 1.000 since November 18th (ish). I've  been keeping the fermentation room at about 75¬∫F, however the must just won't get above 66¬∫F. When it was actively fermenting it was around 75¬∫F. As fermentation slowed, the temperature dropped as well (to be expected).

I've decided to rack today to get them off any dead yeast.

I have begun the journey...,"I have begun the journey... Hello all! Im in Southern California and bought a property with four Cabernet Sauvignon vines. The previous owner had more but the vines died off. In the last month I have expanded to 21 vines total now... 15 cabs, 3 merlot, 1 catawba, 1 flame, 1 midgley (the last three were given to me). Im quite excited to see what I can do with all these. The four cab vines were growing wild and I was able to harvest 10 pounds total. I did test for brix at time of picking FWIW and got 20. No other testing was done.

So I made a 5 gallon batch on the weekend and honestly Im just guessing at it all first time around (I have made beer many times in the past). I would appreciate any input that might help this first batch turn out decent (as can be expected)...

- 1 can Alexanders Sun Country Pinot Noir concentrate
- water to bring it up to 2.5 gal
- 1 gallon welchs grape juice
- 1 gallon welchs red blend grape juice
- 10 pounds of my crushed cab grapes/juice
- 3 cups sugar

I know the welchs will turn people off but hey I just wanted to get to 5 gallons and at the time it made sense. It doesnt seem to make sense now. Im right around 5 gallons anyhow. Ive also added:

- 3 campden tablets
- 2 tsp acid blend

Unfortunately I have no way of testing pH or testing titratable acidity. Next batch I do (a kit or shipped grapes) I'll have everything ready to go. Until then Im working this first batch and with everything added above these are my readings:

- OG measures 1.080
- Brix is at 20.5

Tonight or tomorrow morning I'll be adding in the yeast nutrient and the yeast (4244 wyeast - Italian Red).

Okay... so what have I done wrong and what can I do to make sure this doesnt turn out too too bad. I am worried about the acidity level since I have no way of testing. The concentrate needed some amount of acid blend, but the grape juice has acid in it also. I really hope the 2 tsp of the acid blend Ive added is not overboard.

Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 2,"Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 2 Part 2:

Primary fermentation has begun!

As of yesterday morning, I have 2 buckets with 3 gal each undergoing primary fermentation. I want to make both batches with as much consistency as possible so that the only differing variable is the malolactic conversion on the one batch. With that in mind, my procedure for separating the batches was as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  I started by separating the bentonite and yeast packets into 2 equal portions for each ingredient, 1/2 bentonite packet and 1/2 yeast packet for each batch.
2. I then Carefully measured and separated the juice concentrate into the separate buckets.
3. Added the bentonite to each batch and topped up with water to the 3 gal mark.
4. Took a gravity reading from each sample and luckily ended up with the same gravity on the first try. 1.090 on the dot for each batch.
5.  I tried to take a pH reading using test strips but the result was skewed by the wine color. I thought the strips I bought were able to be used with red wine but I guess not.
6. Took a malic acid reading using test strips and both batches showed the same result of &gt;300mg/l. 
7. Pitched the yeast, covered, and set aside to ferment.

&amp;#x200B;

Lessons learned:

&amp;#x200B;

\-the pH test strips I bought were not the proper strips for red wine. I'm not sure if there are any that will work but I plan to buy a digital meter for the subsequent readings.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward:

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to inoculate for MLF this evening or tomorrow morning. My decision will be based on how steadily the fermentation is proceeding (when the bubbler is consistent and frequent I'll pitch the bacteria).

&amp;#x200B;

As always, your thoughts and input are appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Cheers

Need help. Making lychee wine in developing country.,"Need help. Making lychee wine in developing country. Hey there
I work in Madagascar and the trees are dripping with lychee right now. Next week will be peak ripeness.

The growers sell them by the ""karaba"" which is a handwoven basket that is maybe 40-50lbs of fruit. They can get 3-4$ per one of these baskets full IF they can get it to a city or onto a truck headed there. and the road and conditions are so bad that they often spoil before they can get to a city to be sulfur dusted/refridgerated. Im looking for ways to increase their income and making them into alcohol onsite is one of them.

I have made fruit wines years ago in the states just for hobby purposes but never took it very seriously. Best wine I made was a plum wine with fruit from our plum tree.

Going to experiment this year with a few personal setups and see if lychee wine is drinkable before trying to get people onboard next year. I need to use only materials they can get here to start with. This means using old methods.

Im thinking stomping the lychee by foot, filling a jerrycan with juice, added sugar will probably be lychee flower honey or rough cane sugar because its cheap around here, and using a condom as the airlock. Only yeast I can get is going to be wild yeast or bakers. I can sanitize with chlorine or bleach only. The bottles will have to be plastic as glass is near impossible to transport on these """"roads"""" without shattering. This wont be a gourmet product aimed at western markets, but at other Malagasy people in the cities. They already make grape wine and sell it in shitty plastic bottles in the regions that can grow grapes (not here!) and it does pretty well. They also make and sell a raw sugar cane wine called Betsa in a region just to the south of here and sell it by the jerrycan for parties that is actually pretty delicious. Im hoping to get something similar started for lychee here.

I am 3 days rough travel from the nearest city likely to have supplies of any kind.

Just asking if yall think this method is vaguely sound. As in jerrycan full of pressed lychee juice + yeast + adding some quantity of sugar + time (not sure how long i should aim for). Im also unsure if it should be 100% lychee juice or if I should add water. cost of lychee isnt an issue. Where I am, transporting them to get the market price is so hard they are essentially free if you gather them yourself.

Im also worried about how I will know when fermentation is finished. I dont have any measurment tools.",winemaking

\-9 Pounds of Wildflower Honey in 3 Gallons of Water \[4 kg in \~12L Water\] \[Specific Gravity of \~ 1.115\] 

\-1 Packet of Red Star Yeast: Pasteur Red (5g) \[Tolerates: 63-86 ¬∞F (17-30 ¬∞C) *Alcohol Tolerance of 15%*

\-1 tablespoon (\~15ml) of Yeast Nutrient \[Diammonium phosphate\] 

\-1 tablespoon (\~15ml) of Yeast Energizer 

&amp;#x200B;

**Secondary Fermentation**

\-9-12 lbs of Frozen De-Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Nylon Mesh Bag (Not sure if I should blend, boil it, mash it, etc) 

\-2.5 tsp Pectic Enzyme (1.5 tsp \[\~7.5 ml\] on first day, 1 tsp \[5 ml\] on the fourth day) 

Backsweeten after Cold Crashing

At the beginning, you add the Juice, water to bring it to volume, and yeast.  Wait to weeks and then start your clean up process.  But before all of that, the Bentonite goes in.  Hot water + Clay equals mude.  NEVER mixes.  NEVER forms a slurry.  Always is a bit of a mess if you try to break it down manually.

So my question would be, Is this stuff doing anything for me?  Is it really helping to keep the product clear, even after the fact?  What happens if I give that one part a pass?

Wine Stopped Fermenting. Please help!,"Wine Stopped Fermenting. Please help! I've been making wine with my grandparents for 9 years now and my grandpa passed away last year and he was the expert. We do it old-school Austrian style. Crush grapes and add sugar with warm water. (I don't think it's a factor, but this year my grandma's water heater stopped working so we used cold water.) We then press the grapes and put them in old Bourbon barrels that we clean and then burn sulfur in. The ""wine"" was fermenting great up until last week so we turned up the heat a few degrees in the basement because it's been colder than usual in Wisconsin and that did nothing. No bubbling at all. This has never happened before as we always have a couple bottles of wine at Thanksgiving, but then enjoy the finished product at Christmas. My grandparents have never changed this process so not adding yeast or anything isn't the reason. 

My grandpa once told me that his cousin's wine wasn't fermenting after not using sulfur in the barrels so they emptied the barrels, put burning sulfur in them, added the wine and they started fermenting. Did I possibly not use enough sulfur? I'm not exactly sure what the sulfur does except I know it's necessary.

I think I may have accidentally made wine. Help me figure out what happened?,"I think I may have accidentally made wine. Help me figure out what happened? Hi everyone,

I hope someone here can advise. So we live on a farm which has a number of different trees including a couple grape vines.

About 6 weeks ago, I picked some of those grapes and decided to make juice. Put them in the blender, then filled them in bottles, and put them in the fridge.

However I didn't get around to actually drinking the juice and over the last month things above been happening to them.

1) After about 1 week, they started to get gasssy and smell acidic. I tasted a bit, which was like a mixture of juice and vinegar with gas.

2) Again I didn't drink them. After 3 weeks, the gases increased, it tasted more acidic.

3) I didn't know what was happening, and out of curiosity, I let the bottles remain in the fridge a bit longer.

4) It has now been about 6 weeks since I initially put the bottles of juice in the fridge. NOW

- There is no longer an acidic smell. 
- The gases seen to be gone.
- Surprisingly the ""juice"" does not smell spoilt. It smells a bit sweet, and not quite like juice anymore.

Now I have two questions:

1) Did I accidentally make wine? I did not drink any of it as I am afraid, however it smells surprisingly good.

2) How do I know if it's safe to drink or throw out? I wouldn't like to throw them out because I spent a lot of effort making the juice (or whatever it is now). I wouldn't like it to waste.

Please advise, and sorry if this is a weird question.",winemaking

Help! My elderberry wine won't ferment...,"Help! My elderberry wine won't ferment... I've run into a really weird problem with my latest batch of elderberry wine - it's a 5 gallon batch using 16 lbs of fresh elderberries and 10 lbs of sugar (to keep things simple, I just boiled the water and sugar together and poured over the berries to sanitize). I'm trying to ferment on the fruit, so I haven't removed the berries from the rest of the juice, and I originally pitched a packet of Lalvin EC-1118 a little over a month ago (hoping for a pretty dry wine). There was a little bit of airlock activity initially, then it stopped before much fermentation had taken place. Since I ordered the yeast online, I thought maybe it got shocked in transit, and I purchased another packet of 1118 from a local homebrew store and pitched that a few weeks ago. However, that didn't result in much airlock activity either, and gravity of the juice/wine is still at around 1.070 (for reference, the ambient temperature around the carboy is around 65-70 F).

So I went to the supermarket and grabbed some Welch's juices (Dragon Mango and a Passion Fruit blend), some Fleischmann's Rapid Rise yeast, and some sugar, and mixed it all together as the recipe states and left it in a dark area with the cap unscrewed a little.

I've seen some websites state that hooch can be dangerous, but it seems they're all referring to the vile concoctions made in prison and the only other resources I see that talk about it suggest bread yeast is not good to use because it will have a low alcohol content (5 - 8%).

I don't really care whether or not it knocks me on my ass... I just want to know if the method described in that post and the ingredients I used will be safe to drink once filtered, or if I should just throw it out?

Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 1,"Kit Wine Experiment - Malolactic Fermentation (MLF) Part 1 I made a post recently which started a discussion in the comments about taking a kit wine through malolactic fermentation/conversion. It seems the general consensus is that kit wine and MLF do not go well together. Either producing harsh aromas or affecting the acid balance and leaving the wine tasting terribly (flabby).

&amp;#x200B;

I did a lot of googling and online searching to find out whether anyone has ever successfully done MLF on a kit wine and I failed to find anything. So naturally, this is the perfect chance to have some fun and maybe settle the debate once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The experiment:

* The kit I plan on using is a 6 gal. Syrah kit from Wine Expert (or equivalent) not the highest quality stuff but maybe middle of the road.
* I'll take the entire 6 gal. through primary fermentation per the instructions and then split it in half  by racking into 2 - 3 gal. carboys. One carboy will be the control wine, the remaining steps will be completed per the kit instructions. The other carboy will be the MLF wine.
* I'll have all the necessary testing supplies on hand to check acidity, SO2, etc. and adjust as needed.
* Both wines will undergo the same testing so that results can be compared.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be updating periodically with photos, test results, general notes.

  \- Day 1 - 

* Juice blackberries
* Add sorbate to blackberry juice and wait one day

&amp;#x200B;

\- Day 2- 

* Rack to new carboy, leave out oak
* Add blackberry juice + sorbate 
* Add simple syrup sugar as needed.
* Airlock and let clear for a month or two before bottling

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest concern is that I know the kmeta and sorbate will not kill any of the existing yeast on the fruit when I juice it.

HELP! Why does my ros√© to be smell like vinegar after campden and pectolase?,"HELP! Why does my ros√© to be smell like vinegar after campden and pectolase? Last batch of the season, and we decided to try our hands at ros√©, at the usual 50 litres.
Got 2 kinds of pink grapes that weren't very pink (no black or red grapes where we live anymore) and so we decided to throw in the juice of one pomegranate at the last minute. Put campden. Waited 5 - 6 hours and then added the pectolase. The usual dosages. Left it with a wine bag on top overnight, next to a similar batch of standard white.
Today, during squeezing time I noticed that the must smelt a little like nail polish remover and /or vinegar. Removed a bunch of must from the top and though the smell has reduced, it is still there. The taste is delicious but just a tad like vinegar.
The must is also producing sporadic bubbles.

The white that was right next to it however is completely fine.

What do you guys think happened to the ros√© to be? Anyone has experience with this kind of pre-fermentation vinegaration? We were planning on putting in some more campden, leaving it for a while and then putting yeast in it. We want to give it a try, but is our wine ruined?",winemaking
Wine - thickness query (newbie),"Wine - thickness query (newbie) Hello all, I have recently attempted to join the wine makers in creating wine from scratch without using a wine kit. 

A quick query about a watermelon wine I am making, I have recently racked it off into plastic carboys, but the liquid is rather thick.

I was advised to add some pectic enzyme, so I bought 50g of it in powder form

I have added 1 tsp of powder per 5 litres of wine

Have I added enough/too much and how long should it take to start breaking down the liquid?

It's been about a week and half since I've added the pectic but the liquid still seems too thick, will this eventually waterdown with time?",winemaking
Homemade Airlock fitting problem.,"Homemade Airlock fitting problem. Hey guys, I recently made apple wine and decided to make a hole in my fermenting bucket to put the bung and airlock in. Unfortunately there must be a little gap leaking the co2 out because the airlock hasnt bubbled since I made it all a week ago. I checked to see if it was fermenting and it was definitely. So I have put bluetack around the rim of the bung but still no joy. How do I know when it has finished fermenting and can I leave it in there for a month or so to make sure it has? It's got a heater",winemaking

Bentonite clay during fermentation,Bentonite clay during fermentation Hi. I've recently gotten back into wine and mead making and I'm looking for a good clearing technique where I can get the wine off the yeast quickly and age it with a minimal amount of racking steps. I've heard some people add bentonite clay at (or shortly after) pitching time and the clay gets mixed up during fermentation process and then drags the yeast out once it is done. Does anyone have experience doing it like this?. I would make a bentonite slurry and a yeast starter and probably add the clay a couple of days after pitching yeast.. then rack after a couple of weeks and hopefully have a pretty yeast free wine for bulk aging.,winemaking
Preventing MLF,"Preventing MLF I use kmeta at about 70ppm as well as lysozyme  to prevent MLF.  Is this a guarantee?  Or still risk that something could take over?  Does lysozyme have a short shelf life?  No expiration listed on my bottle.

I‚Äôve been exclusively making wine in 1 gallon batches from kit materials for a couple of reasons ‚Äî small apartment, &amp; I don‚Äôt have easy access to a vineyard or other place where I could buy appropriate grapes (city living, public transportation).

I‚Äôve been trying to source the individual ingredients to buy in bulk to save on costs over the single-batch volumes in individual kits (&amp; also to allow for adjusting the recipe).  I‚Äôve got access to all of the materials except for the varietal juices.

Are there any particular brands you would recommend, or places to buy these online?  If I‚Äôm missing something and it‚Äôs actually easier to obtain the grapes than I realized, I can keep looking into that angle.",winemaking

Community input: Improved campden tabs?,"Community input: Improved campden tabs? We‚Äôre a small research lab friends and family have been bugging to come up with a better/ faster/ stronger campden tablet. Kidding aside they want to know if we can achieve the same effect while reducing the sulfite content of their finished product. And some other things they think could be better about the tablets.

We know chemistry but we‚Äôre not winemakers so we wanted to get some more feedback and maybe spark the interest of a few beta testers as we work through this problem. And to help us figure out how much time we should really put into it. Aka is it a real industry pain point or just a hair-brained idea from folks we‚Äôre obliged to at least pretend to listen to (:

With that in mind any thoughts on what‚Äôs available in the world of campden tablets and how we could make it better would be greatly appreciated. We‚Äôre thinking about these sorts of things, which may or may not apply:

o Reduce sulfites without reducing efficacy 
o Sodium vs. potassium-based, or blended
o Different tablet size, bigger or smaller
o Different tablet dissolution rate, faster or slower
o Better tablet quality (less breaking or chipping, maybe ‚Äúbetter packaging‚Äù-?)
o Include other desired additives
o Increased shelf life
o Do beer makers have different criteria?
o What about mead makers, cider makers?",winemaking

"Flies in airlock water, is this bad","Flies in airlock water, is this bad I went to look at a blueberry wine I am making (about 3 weeks in the glass carboy after fermenting was complete).

Cold ferment--when to rack?,"Cold ferment--when to rack? I'm an enthusiastic beer maker, but rather new to winemaking and am taking my first stab at a thiol-heavy Marlborough-style Sauvingnon Blanc. I'm just using an RJS kit, but I replaced the EC-1118 with the not-so-easy-to-find-in-Canada QA-23 and am fermenting cold to try to cultivate extra grapefruit and passionfruit. 

It's been fermenting at 62¬∞f for 12 days now, but I am unsure when to get it off the yeast. I want to rack it soon because my previous batch has some residual EC-1118 on the nose and I'm wondering if I had it exposed to the yeast too long (I was a dummy and degassed before transferring for the first time--oof). 

But I also don't want to starve it of healthy yeast, since I was very hesitant to add much nutrient, given that I couldn't acquire Stimula Sauvignon or another thiol-seeking equivalent.

Should I just transfer whenever because I'm completely out-to-lunch and need to use Marlborough grapes if I want to make that kind of wine?

To the store bought grape juice wine makers....,"To the store bought grape juice wine makers.... Hey there! I too, have been curious as to what store bought grape juice would taste like as wine. One day I was at Costco and saw they had their brand of Kirkland Concord grape juice in a three liter two pack for, gosh I don't know, like $6-7. I get a little excited and so I bought enough to make 5 gallons of this stuff. I don't remember exactly the kind of yeast or how much sugar I put it. It might have been close to 10 pounds of sugar added. I'm getting better and AT LEAST dating my carboys so I know how long they've been sitting. But here's the cool part...  


I made a few one gallon batches and couldn't resist to try them out after oh, I don't know, about a month maybe. Effing god awful. You can taste the alcohol before the grapes for sure. Not EXACTLY the cool part, but w/e. After making another two one gallon batches I grew more patient and waited about six months before trying one of them. Gotta say, a little hoochie, but not bad. I tried the second one about a year and some months later (no date on the carboy but had to at least been a year), it was actually quite pleasant. Sweet, but not overly, somewhat tarty and what I can only describe as a date/caramel finish. 

I'm going to get some more carboys (maybe) five or so and make one each year on the same day. After 5 years, the last one made will be a year old, then I will compare them. Sorry to all the serious wine makers out there, I'll get there one day and will be looking for your knowledge and expertise, but for now I'm experimenting.

Home wine making and bottle ageing,"Home wine making and bottle ageing I have been making wine for almost two years with a monthly rhythm now of 1 gallon every month. I let my wines go dry, bottling after 3 to 6 months, racking only if sediment looks deep. I never add sorbates, fining agents and I don‚Äôt degas at bottling time.

It‚Äôs been my observation that nearly all the fermentation happens in the primary. So the role of the secondary:

* Finish fermentation and let the yeast clean up things
* Age
* Clarify 

So my conjecture is that bottle ageing has little benefit except for wines with ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù taste factors involved, such as use of the skins, oaking, etc.

But if I‚Äôm making non-fruit wines or wines from juice, I think that the need for bottle ageing is largely a myth. Thoughts?",winemaking
