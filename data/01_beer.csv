"Getting to the bottom of my keg and it is yeast mud, how much yeast is too much to keep the runs away? As the title says, I usually get 2-3 pints from the bottom of my keg which is beyond hazy, it's cloudy/muddy. It's barely a few shades away from what my starters look like. I've been dumping them, but is it safe to drink without any G.I. effects? I know beer is pretty much completely safe but I've anectodally had minor issues with a lot of yeast, which I wouldn't mind avoiding. Also, is there anything I can do to remove any yeast, by the glass? I looked up using coffee filters and every response said absolutely not because of oxidation and contamination. It seems to me they're responding assuming this is going into long term packaging,  however I'm doing this by the glass and only for the last few so neither of these issues would be a concern.",Homebrewing
"Pressure fermentation but bottling.. a never before answered question. So I'm pressure fermenting in a fermzilla with the pressure kit, but I'm also bottling until I purchase a house. I'm pressure fermenting to get minimal/no esters but I also need to bottle.

How do I do that without a racking cane? The information is literally no where. If I absolutely need to, I can, but it seems as if there's some science I can take advantage of.

I'm assuming that I ferment under pressure (but how much), I can turn down the spunding valve, then give my fermenter a little bit of a shake to remove carbonation and then push into bottles via CO2 and a picnic tap with minimal foaming because there's no dissolved gas. And then, of course, carbonate with a carb drop.

Here are the next set of questions-
Is that a correct assumption? Do I even need to worry about that step? How do I know how much dissolved CO2 is in my beer? If I ferment under pressure and release pressure, will the CO2 diffuse over a reasonable amount of time? Will my pressure regulator always indicate the amount of pressure in the whole solution? Or will it be the carbon dioxide have more pressure? 

Do these questions make sense? Am I on the right track?",Homebrewing
"Experimental DME barley wine I have some older dry malt extract (light, dark, and one of the crystal varieties) that I want to use in an experimental 2.5-ish gallon batch of barley wine. Have never done a barley wine, so thought this would be a good experiment. And here’s where the experiment comes in: I have a 2-ish year old (always refrigerated) pack of Wyeast liquid cider &amp; sweet mead yeast. Provided I can get a good healthy starter going, would this yeast work ok? Pros and cons? What will this do, or not do, compared with an imperial ale yeast? Alternatively, pros and cons of using wine yeasts, such as K1-V1116, D47, 71B, etc? 

Planning on OG of around 1.140, with FG at 1.035. Haven’t formulate rest of recipe yet, but this is where I’m at currently. I’ve made a lot of high abv wines and meads over the last couple years, so I’m comfortable with stepped nutrient adds, and other means of nurturing yeast through to fish high abv. If this ferments the beer the way it does with my meads, it shouldn’t have a problem.  If the wine yeasts can handle it, I may consider bumping the OG even higher, or try to ferment drier for an even higher abv. Because science.

Would love to just hear thoughts!",Homebrewing

"Bry-97 neipa Hey folks,

After reading Scott Janishs most recent article in which he spoke about the nectar yeast, he also wrote about aromyzyme. I googled it and read the hype page for the product. While I was reading the page lallemand listed all of their yeasts with the highest bio transformation potential. I was surprised to see bry-97 has the highest amount of the glucoside enzyme which heavily contributed to biotransformation.

"Where can one find grape alcohol used to make brandy?

"Chocolate milk stout... w/ toasted marshmallows??? Hello all, I am a newbie.  I have made a few good batches of beer, some from kits, some from piecing together recipes.

I have a northern brewer chocolate milk stout kit that I’m going to brew later, but I was curious how adding some toasted marshmallows to the boil might change things.  Other than hopefully adding a toasted marshmallow flavor, I assume this will change the starting gravity and give me a higher ABV, but I have no idea how much to add or exactly how it will change my numbers.

Im also open to just brewing this kit as is, considering I don’t really know what I’m doing, so that’s an option... but I live in a very hot climate and probably won’t be able to brew another beer like this until next winter, so it would be cool to experiment.

"Gear and techniques for sparging one-gallon batches After a 7 year hiatus I was given a one gallon Brooklyn Beer Shop kit for Christmas. I brewed it up and was pleasantly surprised by how quick it was so keen to continue with the one gallon size. 

The issue I had was with sparging. I followed their recommendation of using a large strainer that required some juggling to rinse in batches.  It ended up producing some very turbid wort. The only pot I had available was a 6qt Dutch oven. It was fantastic for heat retention during the mash

I used to do 5 gallon BIAB batches but always had more beer than I could drink. I’m more interested in the process and experimentation so one gallon seems perfect. 

I am also now living in a small apartment where space for gear is at a premium.

Some options I’ve seen:
* BIAB - would definitely need a larger pot to handle the increased malt bill. 6qt is already a bare minimum
* 2 gallon cooler - for &lt;$20 could be an easy option to add to existing equipment as well as making mash set and forget. With the addition of a BIAB this could negate the need for a manifold?

I think I know the answer, but not 100% sure

I did my first 5 gal brew with new equipment.   NB caribou slobber.    Brew went well, pitched the yeast included in kit (after cooling).   

Put into big mouth bubbler and capped in the closet.   Woke up the next morning and lid popped off of fermenter, so I taped it down and added blow off tube.     Foam was taking up the full 1.5 gallon of empty space in the bubbler.    Blow off tube was very active for next 24 hours.    Once it calmed down I added a sanitized airlock.     

Since I did that, there is little to no airlock activity and foam is gone.  I know since I had the foam and the blow off activity that I had fermentation.

"Hop additions while no-chilling in kettle Hi awesome community!

I've asked this in the Q&amp;A thread a couple of days ago but it didn't get much (or any) traction and I thought it would be worth creating a post.

For those just leaving the wort in the kettle at the end of the boil to chill, how are you handling hop additions? I'm just a few batches in and have decided that no-chill is the way I want to go forward but have not yet figured out how to handle hop additions. 

My setup is quite basic. My kettle does not have a spigot to take the wort from while leaving hops behind and I have no cube to put the wort to chill so I would prefer to just no-chill in the kettle. 

Right now, I'm using a muslin bag that I throw in the kettle but it keeps coming to the app which makes me think I'm not getting full hop utilization. Plus if I do 3 additions during the boil that's 3 bags I need to prepare and throw in, then remove at the end of the boil. I do the same for whirlpool additions but last time got slightly disappointed after getting almost no hop aroma after 30 minutes of whirlpool.

I've read about accounting for some minutes of boil temperature when doing no-chill but I'm not sure I get it yet - do people account for that and then leave the hops while the worth chills? Any tips?

"Happy results with Hopslam! I just wanted to share that I finally hit the milestone of producing a beer that I’d pay for and I’m pretty stoked about it! I brewed my first beer about three years ago and tried about four more after that initial batch within the year. Although the first beer (from a kit of all things) turned out pretty good, I made average at best beer every batch after that. My processes also sucked and my brew days were about 9 hours long. Average at best beer and full day brew days turned me off for almost two years..

This fall, I got the itch again and I made a chocolate stout recipe that had been highly upvoted on this sub and failed very miserably in the final product...but I didn’t let it discourage me and instead identified everywhere I went wrong and brewed again. I went BIAB for the first time with a new fermenter (instead of my weird system where my only fermenter was my bottling bucket, so I’d ferment in my bottling bucket, transfer the beer to a carboy that was too small to ferment in but large enough to hold my final product in, and then back to my bottling bucket with sugar water added for carbing) and tested out all my skills based on the knowledge I’ve gained from literally every post that’s been posted here for months as well as Papazians’ book.

What I made was a Bell’s Hopslam clone. Pretty much straight from the site except I don’t have Bell’s house yeast and my LHBS was out of honey malt so I subbed in melanoidin plus added some honey to the fermenter after a week.

**Side by side taste test** 

Actual Hopslam just came out today at my local store so I picked up a 6-pack to do a side by side taste test. 

* Bell’s beer has better clarity than mine despite cold crashing and gelatin fining. It might have some chill haze because my beer was clearer on previous pours

* Bell’s has almost no aroma whatsoever and mine has a distinctively honey aroma.

* Bell’s has a lot of hop bitterness, a very small amount of sweetness, and a little bit of maltiness. Mine has a balanced amount of bitterness (although I’d up it next time to match the name), a right amount of sweetness without being cloyingly sweet, and a good balance of maltiness.

* Bell’s finishes very dry whereas mine finishes with the body you’d want from a Midwestern IPA (think Two-Hearted).

All in all, for what made this beer famous which was being a double IPA brewed with honey, I prefer my version more which is honestly mind blowing to me! I see people post about the first time they’d pay for their beer over what they could buy, but this is the milestone first time I can say I have accomplished that myself.

"Jovaru Hard Cider Follow Up [CIDER](https://imgur.com/gallery/EyEROQn)

Final update on my Jovaru yeast Hard Cider. 

It’s done keg conditioning and will be getting bottled this weekend. 

It’s turned out phenomenal. This is the 4th batch of cider I’ve made using this yeast and every time I’m equally amazed at how well it works with cider. 

This batch was made with Jonathan, Northern Spy, Fuji &amp; Ida’s. Not the best hard cider apples but this yeast makes the acid pop. Has a slight lemon pith brightness to it with a slight peppery phenol on the nose. Crisp and sharp. It fermented completely dry but has a previewed sweetness and body from the glycerol that the yeast creates. 

Now I’m trying not to drain this keg before I bottle.",Homebrewing

"My Overly-Ambitious Meat Beer Hi folks. I'm trying to do something... crazy.

A few months ago, some friends jokingly sent me [this image](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/99/64/879964d3ef59d2fc58ac1b6f4304a62f.jpg) of ""Jimmy Dean Beer."" It's clearly a photoshopped joke, but my friends have a reputation for drinking some nasty stuff, and I decided I wanted to call their bluff.

Thing is... I think I can make a meat beer and have it be kind of good.

My research has turned up a few things. I'm familiar with rauchbier and fat washing. I know many other folks have successfully crafted a ""bacon beer"" with these combined methods. But I want to take it a step further.

I want to make bacon *cheeseburger* beer.

My current plan is:

* Smoke the malt, perhaps with either hickory or applewood?
* Brew a rauchbier (specific recipe pending)
* Fat wash some neutral-tasting whiskey or bourbon with rendered bacon fat AND high-fat ground beef
* Fortify the beer with the whiskey
* Profit! (and deeply disturb my friends)

I'm stuck on the ""cheese"" part. All I can currently figure out is to use additional brewers yeast... post-ferment somehow, as I know vegans use it as a cheese substitute. But I don't suspect that will work or taste good.

If this works, I plan to make more. I'm not content to stop at ""bacon cheeseburger"" - I want a whole line of meat beer flavors, mostly by repeating this method with different meats, malts, hops, and smoke woods. I'm also not against adding a sack full of spices during the secondary, as I've had great success doing that with cider.

Now, I've done my share of brewing at this point, but I'm not going to pretend I know everything or that this is as simple as I think it is. So I'm here for advice!

Has anyone ever attempting a meat or strongly-savory beer before? How did it go? Do you think my crazy idea will work, or do you know of ways I might improve the plan *before* my fiancee kills me for making the kitchen reek of wort and grease?",Homebrewing

"We often worry about headspace in our home brew once we rack to secondary. Since there is no actual fermentation going on (assuming you are not undergoing malolactic etc), and we are doing this to clear it up, why not just add some potassium meta? SO2 gas will fill the headspace. SO2 is more dense than O2, so it would sit as a blanket on the surface of your brew. This would prevent oxidation, allow for clearing, and even if you needed to bottle condition later (cider, beer, etc) most commercial yeast will do fine with kmeta added. Even if you didn't want any kmeta in the final product, it should come off when you degas before bottling.

"Brewer Burnout One day long ago, in 2005,  I became aware that I had full-on brewer burnout, from a hobby turned into a passion and too many waking hours thinking about brewing.  I sold the equipment and started drinking much less beer.  The kitchen stove and my (now) late wife thanked me, after brewing for 20 years.  I had almost 300 batches made during those years.

Now retired, last year I started planning to start over, and was delighted to see the all-in-one electric systems that didn't exist in 1985.  So I skipped propane systems and bought an Anvil Foundry system.  I even bought a Darkstar 2.0 burner and propane tank for upcoming decoction batches.

I've brewed one batch on the AF 10.5 and loved how it went and how good the beer tastes, on draft.  It was 5 weeks from brewing day to tapping the keg since patience and time usually produce better beer.

I left it for a week to cool and carb. And I have to say the transformation is night and day. This beer had a week of S-04 and a week of cold crashing and its a veritable fruit salad now. I think I still get a hint of fusels in the back which I'm thinking may be the high pitch temp, maybe this could be rounded off in my next go. Either way I'm very happy with the beer and believe I did avoid any oxidisation of the beer, im thinking the brown color may have been yeast in suspension dyed browner by the DME? Just a guess.

Pours slightly cloudy and slightly green, with a bright white head that does not persist. Aroma is hop-forward, strongly so. Notes of citrus and ?Cilantro? Something strange in the aroma. It's grassy and very herb-like. The lemon and the grapefruit from the hops aren't as prominent as the herby-ness.

Flavor's not as hoppy as I really wanted. It's there, and with really no bitterness to speak of, but it's just not prominent. Honestly, the most lasting impression is just of mineral water. It's VERY minerally.

It's very bubbly and light - definitely the most crushable thing I've brewed, but it's seltzer not beer so that's not surprising.

I think it's time to switch to lite beers for a while!

Does anyone have a favorite recipe for lite lager, table beer, small beer, etc.? Thanks in advance!",Homebrewing
"Question, nitro bulb equipment for ball lock connectors? So I have keg gear, and I have co2 all set up. However I like to make a stout and using nitro bulbs. I want to use the bulbs because I don't drink a lot of stout so i won't be making it that much and also this is definitely something I want to go on small keg to travel with me when we're are allow do that again here (I have a travel tap for stout sourced)

Here is the issue I can't find any ball lock nitro kits like you can for co2 I have one for co2 but it's for threaded bulbs which I don't believe will work for the nitro... I happy make my own but it hard to figure out what the connections are. Would anyone know what list of parts I would need? Or a kit I can get. Idea both as I am probably going to have to source the parts locally. (Ireland)

"Why is beer drinkable SOONER than wine after fermentation had stopped? I make a lot of meads and wine, and they almost always require MONTHS of aging, even after fermentation had completed. Although my beers still seem to benefit from a week or two post-fermentation, they're sooo much quicker to drink! 

I'm aware that one big factor is ale vs wine yeast, but even my meads made with beer yeast still need long aging. What else necessitates this extra time? Can I change things to my advantage? Probably alcohol percentage, but that's still not the whole picture, I feel. 

I'm going to make a weird brew that's half beer and half wine, and I was hoping to leverage this knowledge to make it drinkable sooner. Perhaps I can make it more beer-like in ways that make it speed along to drinkability. Thanks for your advice!",Homebrewing
"Ferminator homebuilt clone This piqued my interest today [https://www.geterbrewed.com/ferminator-basic/](https://www.geterbrewed.com/ferminator-basic/) 

£200 seems pretty steep to me for what appears to be a glorified thermometer + fan in some polystyrene. 

BUT I do like the idea of using something like this as opposed to a modded fridge. And I just get the feeling you could put basically the same thing together using an inkbird for less than half that price.

"Fermenter Updgrade from Bucket to Stainless Steel Hi guys, i've been in the learning process of Hombrewing for about 6 or 7 months.

started with the easiest way of brewing which is extract, then i upgraded it to BIAB.

&amp;#x200B;

i mostly make American Pale Ale's  Stout's and red irish, and since the weather in my city is hot i started using KVEIK yeast for all of my brews.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in my recent brews i've been having issues and been having to put a lot of effor on bottling, cause of the use of the buckets as  fermenters, one of the issues is the trub loss, i end up losing about 3 or 4 litters (1galon) of useful beer, so i was thinking of upgrading my fermenter to a Stainless Steel one and getting the equipment to recycle the yeast and stuff like that

you have any personal experiences or sugestions with Stainless brewers and brands?, i definitely don't want a plastic conical fermenter cause i've read they're shitty and they break as soon as you use them",Homebrewing
"Do I need to repitch yeast? Just brewed a NEIPA on Sunday night. I used WLP007 as the yeast. I pitched it at 72 degrees and come Monday morning, it had formed a nice krausen.

"Yeasty Hey all,

I've been having a problem with my beers lately where they all have a similar off taste. Couldn't figure it out, might still not have. I made sure with my last beer that it saw no light, and I only agitated it when I bottled it. It wasn't infected and it smelled the same off smell it has before even bottling. 

Then the other day, I was eating some home made cinnamon rolls and it kinda tasted similar to how the beer taste. The only thing they had in common is yeast. So I'm hoping that it's just yeasty tasting and that I may have found the cause of the off taste. 

I use the Safale US-05 yeast. I don't brew often so I keep it in the fridge until I use it. It's never expired before I use it either. 

I'm wondering if using different would help with the taste, or if I don't let it sit in the carboy as long. Let is sit longer? I usually do the recommended time that is written on the directions for the kits I use. 

Any recommendations would be great.",Homebrewing

"Tripel Karmeliet Clone - which Mangrove Jack yeast? Hey everyone.. Need some advice..  I asked a friend to pick a beer they'd want me to try to emulate, and they picked a Tripel Karmeliet.  I have a grain bill pretty much worked out, but am not entirely sure which yeast to use.  Where I am I pretty much only have access to Mangrove Jack dry yeast, and there are three or so that I could use - M31 (Belgian Tripel), M41 (Belgian Ale), and M47 (Belgian Abbey).  I've used M47 before, and it didn't knock my socks off.  I was leaning towards using M41 since the description sort of matches what I think the Karmeliet should taste like.

"Need some help with glycol chiller. So I was fortunate enough to receive the Ice Master Max 2 as a Christmas present this year. Prior to receiving this, I am using the spike brewing cooling system. It’s basically an Ink Bird controller with a heating pad and pump in a cooler with ice. 

Being in Texas, I sometimes find myself needing heating and cooling in the same day. It will dip into the 40’s at night and reach almost 80 during the day. My issue is that I cannot use the heater and chiller at the same time. I only have one thermowell to use temp probes. The ice master 2 apparently has a way to connect a heating pad to the pid controller to control heat and cooling. 

Is there anyone with the spike heater and the ice master 2 that has done this? If you have, I’m curious on how you went about doing this, or how you were able to use both heating and cooling simultaneously?",Homebrewing

"Mystery Leak from Keg I'm at my wits end at this point. I'm losing CO2 rapidly on back to back tanks and have not been able to find a leak anywhere on the keg, hoses, or regulator using the soap bubble method. I checked the in/out, hose connections, hose clamps, where each of the gauges mets the regulator, the tank to regulator connection, keg release valve, literally everywhere that has a seal/connection/clamp.  It is a used keg, but has new lid seals with no obvious damage to the in or out posts and was working fine until last weekend.  The last working tank died of natural causes last Wednesday, exchanged Friday, discovered Sunday 2nd tank was empty after maybe 5 pints, exchanged today, newest tank already dropped considerably. The 3 gauge regulator is maybe a few months old with no falls/drops. 

Can anyone think of what I'm missing? I know tank gauges aren't the most accurate measurement, but it's showing a drop of a 1/3 over the past hour and I'd write that off to temperature drop and refilling the headspace if this wasn't exchange number 2 that's draining rapidly with no obvious leaks.",Homebrewing
"Friendly reminder. Happy New Year guys!  


I was spending time with family these holidays while I left some usual stuff brewing that normally doesn´t stay long like Kvass or Kombucha, but its well known how active they are and how they can re-paint your room. First of all I was pretty confident about the bottles used and time vs methods, but **friendly reminder #1** Be on the safe side, carefully select the kind of bottle for the time you deem safe, different brews, different times and activity.  


When I went back home I decided to open the bottles to release pressure, as they didn\`t explode while I was away, why not prevent them exploding when I was there? So **Friendly reminder #2** Get a towel or something and muffle the force of the initial explosion, depending on which mechanism of closing the bottle has, it has different behaviours, so its better to go on the safe side and protect yours hands and yourself, and meanwhile **Friendly reminder #3** Protect your walls, go to a bathroom or somewhere where the potentially violent reaction wont be a trouble.  


I took my bottles to the bathroom, I put a kitchen towel over the cap and flip it, not one of my craziest reactions, still glad I did it in the bathtub, it tasted delicious so I put it back in the fridge.  


And last friendly reminder, don´t be afraid of mistakes, mistakes will happen, but let them happen on flavour profiles, not on the safety side, be careful guys,  


...  
For those interested at what my brew was, it was Kvass, roughly bread beer that is made with stale bread and bread yeast, which is not very alcohol resistant (Resulting usually at 2% at most alcohol). Kvass is normally brewed for 2 to 4 days.  


Instead of bread yeast, I used turbo yeast, which is very active, used for 48 hours brews and has high alcohol tolerance, I also left it fermenting for a month.",Homebrewing
"Fermentrack and RaspberryPints side-by-side A few questions, opinions are also welcome...

I want to run Fermentrack and RaspberryPints side-by-side.  RaspberryPints as a taplist for the kegerator and Fermentrack to connect to two esp8266s running BrewPiLess controlling my two brew fridges.

I see on the Fermentrack installing page that there is a guide for installing the two side by side.  My first question, has anyone done this successfully before?  It doesn't seem that difficult to have nginx present the RaspberryPints pages but you know what they say about assumptions.  I plan on looking at the packages required, adjusting the RaspberryPints install to have it use nginx rather than Apache and then cross my fingers and hope the instructions from there-on aren't too bad.

"I finally did it! It’s been a year since I started brewing and one of my main goals was to be able to brew a hazy IPA that can compare to the likes of those sought-out limited releases. 

After some trial and error, I think I have came up with something that I like and want to use as a foundation for any hazy. My main goal was to create a super murky and juice bomb ipa. 

A couple of new things that I tried that I think had the biggest impact: 

- Used majority of malted oats instead of flaked. I feel it created more mouthfeel and contributed to more haze. 
- Used Voss Kveik for the first time and have decided it is my favorite out of all the Kveik strains I have used. 
- Used Kveik with a temperature controller instead of relying on hot summer days
- Only did a 15min boil with barely any bittering 
- Fermented in a keg, only opening to dry hop

I had some issues with a blowout because I had too much volume. I’m pretty sure I had too much sparge water and did not boil long enough to get to my planned fermenting volume. I also had an issue with my floating dip tube getting pulled off by the crazy Kveik power. Unfortunately I had to open the keg and retrieve the dip tube to reconnect it, but I used it as an opportunity to add a final dry hopping. All in all it was one of the smoother brew days I had.

"Removing yeast from bottles So I've only brewed 2 beers. One was a recipe from northern brewer that came with all the stuff and was a grain/malt extract mix and the other beer was an all grain recipe from my local homebrew shop. A problem I've noticed after conditioning my bottles was the dead yeast that would accumulate at the bottom of my bottles. After seeing it in my first beer I wasnt sure if I had gotten too much junk in my bottles bc I had a lot of trub in my fermenter or if the fizz drops that came with the kit had too much sugar. But after the all grain recipe I still have the dead yeast in my bottles. For the second recipe I followed some directions from my homebrew shop which was 1oz priming sugar per gallon of beer dissolved in an equal part water.

To state my question:
Will I always have this small amount of yeast in my bottles or am I doing something wrong?

"Switching to Fermenting in Kegs I'm thinking about switching to fermenting in my corny keg and wanted to clarify things, and ask questions.

I already have a spunding valve, and carbonate/condition beer post fermentation in corny kegs with floating dip tubes, so adapting to fermenting should be simple.
So questions:

* I know I need to drop my volume from 5 Gallons (19 L) finished to 4.5 Gallons (17 L) in the keg to ferment. Do I **need** to use FermCap? or is that drop in volume enough?
* For the beers that don't have any additions post boiling, my plan was to simply pitch yeast, seal the keg, hit it with 20 PSI CO2 (like I do for conditioning) and attach a Spunding valve set for the appropriate PSI to carbonate as well. Is that fine? The guides/reviews I've read talk about using extra CO2 to purge kegs of sanitizer to use as serving kegs. But for the most part I'd plan on not using those methods and just using the fermentation keg to serve as well, unless I'm missing something?
* What to do about recipes that call for post fermentation additions? Specifically the recipes I make would involve Fruit Puree or Cacao Nibs. Should I just put those in the fermenting keg, instead of faux-secondary? I usually just put those additions in the conditioning keg so there's pretty long exposure anyway.",Homebrewing

My initial thought was temperature control for fermentation. I do not have anything controlling that other than ambient temperature (and thus am currently limited to brewing ales). However, I've also considered investing in kegging. 

What's everyone's thoughts and do you have any recommendations equipment wise, whether it's for one of the two things I listed above or a direction I haven't considered? Thanks in advance and thanks for the all the other helpful stuff on this sub! I'm looking forward to continue getting better at home brewing!",Homebrewing

"First time hard seltzer and cider smell made hard seltzer using distilled water, salts and yeast nutrient additions, sucrose and red star DADY for the first time.  Fermentation went slower than I wanted but it never stalled and it reached the expected FG.

Would food grade activated charcoal help ?  do people just spoon that into the fermentor or do you have to run it through a carbon filter ?

"Fake English Accent – Kveik Pale Mild w/ Amarillo – 3.7% [https://imgur.com/gallery/IwEWIM7](https://imgur.com/gallery/IwEWIM7)

Full blog post here: [https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2021/01/04/fake-english-accent-kveik-pale-mild/](https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2021/01/04/fake-english-accent-kveik-pale-mild/)

Lately, I've been working on developing some low-ABV beers to counteract some of the more deleterious effects of 2020, and this one is my favorite so far. 

I had this idea that the sense of fullness that kveik often leaves would really benefit a smaller beer like a mild. I also thought that the orange esters Voss can throw might work well with Amarillo's well-known citrus profile, even if I kept the hopping pretty restrained. 

Turns out I wasn't far off! Obviously this is non-traditional, but it came out tasting remarkably English despite the American/Belgian malt and Norwegian yeast.

**Beer Recipe (4.5 gal):**

* 4.5# Mecca Grade Estate Malt Lamonta (can sub with any good pale ale malt)
* 0.5# Mecca Grade Estate Malt Opal 44 (a light English crystal would work here)
* 0.5# Aromatic
* 10g Amarillo \[8% AA, 11 IBU\] @ 60 minutes
* 20g Amarillo \[10 IBU\] @ 15 minutes
* 1/3 packet dry Lallemand Voss kveik, pitched at 85F
* Procedure: Mash at 160F for 60 minutes, boil 60 minutes, chill to 85F, pitch yeast, marvel when it's done in 12-24 hours. Let it sit a couple more days to clean up, keg or bottle, and enjoy.

**Beer Stats:**

* Est. OG: 1.035
* Actual OG: 1.041 (93% efficiency thanks to my ultra-thin mash; whoops!)
* Est. FG: 1.011
* Actual OG: 1.013
* Est. ABV: 3.1%
* Actual ABV: 3.7%
* IBU: 21

"Found these really weird blobs in my ""starter wort"". Is this coagulated protein? If not, should I be concerned and dump it? I usually have these jars of leftover wort sitting in the fridge for when i need a starter, they are still well sealed. But when i looked at them today, i found [these large blobs](https://imgur.com/a/S3ccYDa) floating in it (which i'm positive did not exist when i first added the wort to the jars). The small ""globules"" are normal, but this is the first time i see these big blobs.

First thing i thought was well the fridge has been extra cold this past while, could this be coagulated protein? The jars are sealed, so there was no smell test administered.

**What do?**

Some background:

Whenever i brew a batch, i tend to have 0.5L of wort left in the bottom of my kettle, trub and all. I usually dump this into sanitized jars and drop the jars into boiling water for around 15-20 mins, which leads to the lid  being sucked in once it cools down (to give me an indication that as long as it doesn't pop, nothing got in).

When I need to make a starter, i strain the trub and boil the wort for 15mins to help sterilise it (botulism toxins and the such) and then dilute it to 1.040-1.030.",Homebrewing

"Did I kill my fermentation by attaching a CO2 trap? ...and, has my TILT gone mad? Hi all,  I've got a weird issue.

On Sunday I brewed a Light Mexican Lager.  It is my first time doing this style.  

Recipe was 64% malt, 36% flaked corn, 2.4 oz hops.

I Pitched 2 packets of S-189 directly onto the wort at 52F @ the thermowell ( 55F at TILT)

OG was supposed to be 1.048, but was 1.054 based on a refractometer that I calibrated with water earlier in the day.

My first issue I had was when I dropped the TILT into the PET carboy, and got my first reading it said 1.063.  Stupidly, I had not calibrated the tilt before this brew day (I have in the past).   So, I went into the API and set the calibration correction based on the refractometer reading.

Things started very slowly, and nothing was happening for nearly 24 hours.  Then I got bubbling, and it got to about 1in of krausen when the TILT read that I'm 20% through fermentation. Up to this point, I just have a blow-off tube in a jar of Starsan.

I have the Northern Brewers CO2 Trap (to prevent O2 suckback) and I read somewhere that I should let the fermentation go a bit to clear the O2 before attaching the CO2 trap.  So, at this time, I decided to take the blow-off tube out of the jar of starsan and attach to the CO2 trap.

Since then, it's like the whole thing stopped working.  The CO2 trap hasn't continued the bubbling that was happening into the blowoff.  The TILT is even saying that gravity is INCREASING!  Is that even possible?  I'm using 32oz jars, could the back pressure of pushing up that slight amount of liquid maybe 5 inches to top of the hose arc be causing this?

Also:  I have squeezed the carboy slightly to prove that the lines aren't blocked.  I can see the water level in the final bubble air lock move when I do this.   Also also, the TILT's temp readings are consistent with the thermowell +3-4 degrees which it always seems to be.

"How many of you spund in primary? What's your regimen? For those that don't know what spunding is, it's a German technique of fermenting under pressure to a specified PSI, usually 10-15 PSI, venting off the rest like normal.  The primary benefits are ester suppression and natural carbonation of the beer.   This saves you time and money, and potentially giving you a cleaner beer (though I've never noticed a difference... one of the [rare Brulosopy experiments that turned out significant](https://brulosophy.com/2018/02/26/carbonation-methods-pt-3-force-carbonation-vs-spunding-exbeeriment-results/) though).

This requires a fermenter that can hold that much pressure.  I picked up a flex+ bargain cave that I have been lagering in, it can take 15 PSI, so I've spunded the last couple of lagers I've done.  I've tried waiting for the Diacetyl rest (just enough remaining fermentation to carbonate), and I've done it as early as day 2 for a vigorous fermentation.  So... after 100 lagers the flex might pay for itself?  

My favorite aspect is that I haven't had to exchange a single CO2 tank this year, and the beer can go right down for lagering under pressure, no vacuum issues with cold crashing.  I actually started doing it because I read about the ethanol/CO2 shortage (which turned out to be not a big deal, my hardware store has plenty of full tanks), why dispense all that precious CO2 back into the atmosphere?

Anyway, curious how other spunders do it, what do you set your PSI, and at what point during fermentation?",Homebrewing

"Smaller gas line for serving? (Liquid?) I'm familiar with the 5/16 x 9/16 Bevlex gas line.  Good for pushing suds without getting plastic smells into the brew, but it's oh so thick and bulky.

Does anyone know of smaller diameter alternative that won't off-gas VOCs and make things smell like plastic?

Similar question for liquid lines, though that's less of an issue.  (I'm aware of line balancing equations and all that.)

That's the gist, but details for anyone wants 'em:

I'm trying to finish a box-top keezer project that has stalled for a number of reasons, one of which being the thick, stiff, bulky gas lines.  The thing just has too many of them going on.  Regulator access doors won't close properly, and fitting the lines through the hole from the box to the lower keg compartment is both very difficult and also chokes off airflow to the top.

I've been thinking, if I could replace all that gas line with a smaller diameter it would be a huge leap toward getting this thing finished.  

While I'm at it, this made me curious if the same could be done with liquid lines.  Partly because that would also help save space in line runs, partly because I prefer a higher carbonation and currently have to carb a bit lower than I'd like to make serving work.  Also I figured maybe less foam would collect behind the shank if the tube were smaller, make the first pour work better.  I believe my current lines are 1/4"".

What's making this an issue is I made the genius move of trying to put nine taps in the dang thing.  So if I increase line length to carb higher, that's a LOT of extra coiled up line.  The alternative is to remove some taps and put blanks in the tap board, which would be a shame because it looks really nice how it is.",Homebrewing
"New Question: Is this Cider infected? Hey all,

I'm relatively new to home brewing and this is my second batch of brew. This is hard cider (from a kit) that I wasn't sure properly fermented over a few months.

I sanitized the bung and taped it shut because I didn't have any better options and then went out to the store the next morning to buy a replacement airlock; about week later I opened the closet and am greeted by [Sad Cider](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mj7xvLiLCTaMn6srdaVoSxUvRvvBRvt5/view?usp=sharing).

"Brewing gone wrong —should I keep my wort? This was my first time brewing.

We were having a hard time keeping the temperature at adequate levels, but it would heat and stop randomly —at some point we got a hand thermometer and realised the readings where way, way off.

We did not mash or introduced hops at the correct temperature, or followed the times recommended by [the recipe](https://www.amazon.com/James-Morton/dp/1849497273). We could not cool it on time (30' with a cooler and running hot! I think the kettle might have been heating while off), so I covered the wort and let it cool down to room temperature over night. At this point the OG was 1.0298, but I'm not very confident in my reading.

The next day I read the gravity again and it was 1.039 —I then pitched in the yeast (11.5gr of dry yeast hydrated from the day before at room temperature, plus 1 bag of liquid yeast no starter). Nothing has happened in two weeks. No bubbles, no foam. The wort tastes kind of nice, smells hoppy, but it's not alcoholic and definitely nor carbonated. I aerated the wort after one week and took a gravity reading, and just again today, and it's constant at 1.039 so it's definitely not fermenting.

"Yeast starter - sucrose vs malt extract question I've heard it said over and over that yeast starters should be done with some sort of malt extract so that the yeast don't adapt to the sucrose and then produce something funky when pitched into the wort. On paper, that makes sense.

But when I go and look at the exBEERiments done on yeast pitching rates, starters, etc., they seem to me to have results that often go against the conventional wisdom

Has any actually tried starting yeast in table sugar to see if it makes a difference? Because if it doesn't, then making yeast starters suddenly gets a whole lot easier.

That said, the yeasts ability to adapt to sucrose at the detriment of fermenting wort is probably strain dependent, so any results might not carry over to another yeast strain.",Homebrewing

I'm certain the issues with the previous batches is I wasn't waiting long enough, but I hit my (estimated) FG on both of those-does anyone have an idea of why my S04 is shooting way past my estimated FG?",Homebrewing
"Help Fixing funky smell from hops Hi I made a 15 litre batch of kombucha, the goal was to create an IPA aroma using a blend of different hops. I dry hopped in a mesh bag at 4 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. My hops were 

1. 30g simcoe 
2. 15g citra 
3. 7.5g East Kent goldings

It had a funky smell post dry-hopping and also after carbonation. My questions are

1. Is there anyway to fix this? I don’t mind the aroma since it tastes fine

2. a) I’m based in Asia and got these hops from Belgium, has it been damaged because of the long trip? (Tbh it smelled fine, but my nose is not trained)

b)If these hops have been damaged would I be able to age it and use it for a “lambic” style beer? 

3. a)Is this the right type of hops bill to use?  I’m   looking for something either fruity or citrusy with a slight herbal aroma, any other hops suggestions will be appreciated
     b)Was my dry-hopping method correct?",Homebrewing
"Reliable Gruit recipe I would like to attempt making Gruit. I'd like to make it right the first time and I'm struggling to find many recipes that have any reviews or are done by experienced brewers. A lot of them sound experimental.

"My last all-grain batch had terribly low OG. Trying to figure out the causes (full recipe/water data included) Hello hello and happy new year dear reddit brewers.

On Saturday I got together with a friend and we made (or tried to, lol) a West Coast IPA. This was my 5th all grain brewday since I got back into it at the end of November, and it was my worst one so far.

At the end of the mashing, my measured gravity was ONLY 1.032, which then became 1.038 after boiling. Our target, or at least what beersmith predicted, was 1.055. A disaster for a WC.

We ended up adjusting it with table sugar, but I want to ask this community some help into understanding what the possible reasons for this very low efficiency.

I'm gonna put all the data I know here, and close with the ideas and questions I have.


**Recipe**

* 1.50kg 2-row
* 1.30kg Carared

11L batch size, 16.4 strike water (BIAB).

Mashed at 65C for an hour.


**Water**

Where I live the tap water is not chlorinated at all, which is excellent news.

* Calcium 118.6 ppm
* Magnesium 13.6 ppm
* Sodium 36.8 ppm
* Sulfate 148.9 ppm
* Chloride 58.1 ppm
* Bicarbonate 250 ppm

The water was filtered through a Brita Maxtra+ filter, which from what I've been reading it could have been one of the mistakes (see the questions section later).

**Ideas**

I'm putting down here some ideas I have of what went wrong.

1) The water profile is not great, as it's way too alkaline. I don't own a PH-meter yet but beersmith predicts a 6ph.

2) Filtering the water may have been a mistake, as I don't know what the water profile will be afterwards. The Maxtra+ filter contains ion exchange resin, which lowers the water hardiness (less calcium == even more alkalinity). However their wording is unclear whether it also reduces the bicarbonate levels to compensate it, and if so how much.

3) The recipe has its flaws too. Way too much crystal malt, which has no enzymes. Maybe the enzymes in the 2-row are not enough for compensating the complete lack of them in the Carared.


**Questions**

When asking another friend with more experience, he told me **""Yeah but PH/temperature/enzyme activity influences only the FG not the OG""**. Hence the first, more important question:

**1) What influences the OG reading?**

I know the PH and temperature influences the sugars/starches composition of the wort making it more or less fermentable by the yeast (hence the FG changes). But does it also influence the extraction of the starches from the grain? Or should it that happen anyway?

After all even if all the sugars are not fermentable because I fuck up say the mash temperature, they are still there and should be picked up by the OG hydrometer reading. Or not?


**2) Does the alpha/beta amylase enzyme activity (or lack thereof) influence the extraction of the sugar from the grains?**

Or is it a separate process, meaning the starches get from the grain to the water anyway and then the conversion happens in the ""broth""?


**3) Does anyone know how the Brita Maxtra+ filter influences the profile, and if it removes the bicarbonate as well?**

I have searched a lot but the only discussions I see are quite outdated and only about how (not) good it is for removing Chlorine and Chloramine. This is probably due to the fact that earlier Brita models didn't have an ion exchange layer - only the carbon filtering.


**4) Would a longer, maybe steeped mashing time help?**

I guess it should as I managed to extract a great OG from another recipe (see closing note), but a steeped mashing is harder to tweak afterwards when I want to change the body of the beer. Or is it?


**Closing note**

Before this batch I made a Golden Ale, which is still fermenting strong, in which I managed to get the target OG in full (1.080) with a 1.5h long steeped mash (20m@48C, 40m@62C, 20m@70C) as by recipe instructions.

I used the same water, filtered in the same way. So I'm quite stumped by how well it worked, and makes me think again whether the OG is influenced by the ph at all as my first question.

Before that the other batches were all single step and all had low OG, except the first one which had the same recipe of this thread (including all that carared) and it came out OK. A tad lower than predicted if I remember correctly, but not a disaster like this last Saturday. And the beer tasted great!

"Hoprate or base beer recipe for first try at sour beers? (no kettle sour) Hi guys and gals! I'm currently reading 'American sour beers' from Michael Tonsmeire. And he suggests for your first sour to brew a light base beer with low ibu's, then pitch a sour blend (from wyeast or white labs) together with brewing yeast. So it can develop while reading in the book. 

I don't have any good recipe of my own that fits a light low ibu beer. When I search for sour beer recipes online, I mostly find kettle sours, which isn't the plan for this brew. 

Any good base beer recipes or tips? I was thinking 75% Maris otter, 20% Light wheat malt and 5% Aroma 150.
Not sure how my hop rate should be. Low amino acid? On 20 Liter (5.5 gallon) how much hops should be added?

"Water profile for Czech Pilsner I'm seeing conflicting information about what the ideal water profile would be for a Czech Pilsner (or any European pilsner for that matter).  I've seen recommendations for very soft water, and Ca concentrations in the 7-12 ppm range (which sounds right for soft water). However, I've also seen discussions that Ca should be at 40-50ppm minimum for general yeast health.  How have you modified water for a pilsner?

"Interpreting city's water report: Calcium vs Alkalinity (as CaCO3) I'm getting ready to brew my first pilsner, which I understand needs really soft water, and I'm confused by how Calcium is measured and calculated in my city's water report and in EZ Water.  I pulled my city's water report and it lists Ca as 12ppm and alkalinity as 46 ppm as CaCO3.  I feed this into EZ water, and without any additions or adjustments, the final water shows as 12ppm Ca.  My question is why it doesn't consider any Calcium contribution from CaCO3.  

Even if the 12ppm Ca comes only from CaCO3, this is still underestimating -- Ca has a molecular mass of 40Da, CaCO3 is 100Da, so 46ppm of CaCO3 would contribute 18ppm Ca (40/100*46 =18).

"Taking RDWHAHB to a whole new level Just wanted to share this little story to ease the minds of any new brewers.

I'm making my first batch on my new eBIAB all in one that I built out of an old keg (see my post history for more if you're curious). It ferments right in the kettle and all is going well - mash got about 70% efficiency, boil worked beautifully with the 5500w element, let it cool naturally and pitched my kveik at around 90°.

Fermentation took off, and I let it naturally cool further to about 65. I don't really bother that much with temp control. I wanted to make sure it fully attenuated though so I turned the element up a tiiiiiny little bit. Checked it after about 12 hours and it was up to about 70 or 75. Nice. Turned the element down a bit but kept it on. Temp dropped a little bit since the room is really cold. Turned it up a touch and decided to make a reflectix jacket and lid since my brewing room is friggin cold.

So I insulated the rig..... And forget to turn the element back down. Wake up in the morning to..... 140°. Well, at least fermentation is definitely complete.

Turn it off, take the jacket off, cool it as fast as I can. Shit shit shit. Smells like bananas. It must have fermented a bit more at an absurdly high temperature. I keep it as cold as I can (about 55°) for the next few days and take a little sample here and there to try to convince myself it's fine and I should bottle it. It isn't. It's gross. And I'm not picky about my beer at all.

I figure I might as well do three bottles instead of dumping it all just as an experiment. So I fill my three 750ml flip tops and dump the rest. Sad day.

One of the bottles is clear glass, and holy shit the beer is super clear. Surprising, considering I don't really bother worrying about clarity. Okay, crack it and close it. PPSSSHHH. WHAT! It actually bottle conditioned. I totally thought I killed the yeast. I know kveik is hardy, but holy shit it sat for hours at 140+°.

"CNC'd an adapter lid for my K-RIMS setup so I could do a vertical stack [https://imgur.com/a/82vVI0Z](https://imgur.com/a/82vVI0Z)

Over the Christmas break I got to thinking about my BIAB setup, and realized with only a few more bits of equipment (auto-sparge, some new QD ports &amp; silicon) I could do a K-RIMS setup.  Did my first successful brew on Jan 1st, and it went great!  Mash recirculation and temp control like a boss.  For that brew, I had my mash tun on my work bench, and the boil kettle on the ground (over my NG burner.  So sort of a 'side-by-side / 2-level' system.

I liked the look of the vertical stack that the Blichmann Breweasy does, but I had no idea if my two kettles (7.5 gal and 14.5 gal) would fit their adapter lids (couldn't ever find any dimensions, and didn't need all the extra parts included in the kit) :   Last night I realized I could do the same over/under setup pretty easily :  Just need to cut a donut shaped ring on my CNC of the correct circumferences.

33 minutes of cutting later (1/2"" plywood), and the mockup worked great.  I put a small hole in it to gravity feed in the returning wort from the mash tun, but during my next supply run I'll get another QD port mounted to the boil kettle which will also double as a whirlpool.

Yes I'm on gas, no I'm not worried about fire.  You know how much humidity mashing puts off, and if my flames get that high I have other problems.

"Self Carb in Bottles - champagn-y or soda-y beer? I self carb all my beers in a bottle.

ANYWAY. Almost all my beers come out with a champagne or soda mouthfeel after its done carbonating.

I'm looking for some recommendations for a new heating element from those of you who have electric setups.

I converted one of my brewing kettles to an electric setup using a 1650 watt element controlled by an Inkbird-ipd 16s. I run my setup on 120v (15 amp circuit - not ideal, but it's what I have to work with). It worked well for the first two brews, however the coating on the heating element started to chip and flake off when I was cleaning up last night. This exposed the copper underneath, so I am going to buy a replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a ""Go-to"" heating element for 120v that would meet these requirements?

\- Stainless steel

\- ULWD

\- Can be run on 120v / 15 amp circuit

\- Powerful enough for 3.5-4 gal batches

\- Can be easily purchased in Canada

\- Won't cost me an arm and a leg

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, are there any of you who run 220v heating elements on 120 circuits that would fit this bill? From my understanding, you can run these and expect 1/4 the power on 120.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or suggestions you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

"harvested yeast - how to prevent over/under pitching? Ive been using harvested yeast recently, i usually brew with a friend frequently enough that we can use the yeast within 2 weeks or a months. i save maybe 0.25L of nice top layer yeast from 1st fermentation and this seems to work just fine for 20L batches. I just wake the little fellows up with some sugar water the night before. I also add yeast nutrient to the brewing wort before pitching.

"First time using a starter So I made made my first starter..... And what an experience it is.
Its 2.5 day into fermentation and the beer is practically finnished (1.0006- 1.0007). Put the dry hop in lets hope that the CO2 is going to displace the O2. And the funniest thing is that there is still a high krausen. Nuts. Just wanted to share this experience.

"Galaxy hops So I have some Galaxy hops from this year's crop (2020) that I want to use in an IPA together with some Citra, Ella and Pacific Jade. I'll be using the Citra at whirlpool and the rest of hops for a Dry hop, in total I'll be adding 10gr/L at DH as I'm using Hornindal from WL as my yeast of choice so I think 10 gr/L is enough. How much Galaxy should I use per litre?

Now that I have fermented, I am going to add finings and condition for about ten days then bottle and carbonate. 
My question is - during the conditioning and carbonation, can I move the bucket back to the garage where at the moment the temp is probably about 7-8C given the weather, or condition and bottle at the current temperature (18-20) if I don’t use any extra warming?",Homebrewing

My question: Can I still use table sugar to carbonate it? Will the yeast eat up that sugar and produce some CO2? Or is this yeast done for good, dead, and I should just get another packet of yeast?

"Roggenbier - is thick/viscous mouthfeel considered a flaw? I recently brewed a 50% rye malt roggenbier with a recipe inspired by [this Beer &amp; Brewing article](https://beerandbrewing.com/make-your-best-roggenbier/), and while it turned out tasting great I did find that it had a thick/viscous mouthfeel for its 1.015 FG, which I've heard is due to proteins or beta-glucans or something like that in the rye malt.

Having never tasted a commercial roggenbier, is a thick mouthfeel style-appropriate - or should the mouthfeel be similar to other German styles like the Weizen? 

I only did a single infusion at 67C, and having read that other people call for protein/beta-glucan rests to break down the mash, I'm wondering if doing that would have made for a less viscous roggenbier.",Homebrewing
"Splitting a 5G batch between keg (3 gallons) and bottles (2g), how should I carbonate the beer? I've been kegging my beer exclusively since March because I find it much easier thank bottling to do by myself.

However, I have a dubbel fermenting and I only have a 3 gallon keg available as my other kegs are occupied so I am looking to Keg some and bottle as little as possible. 

My questions is about the best way to go about carbonating the beer. Would it be ok to use priming sugar on the whole batch and let all of it naturally carbonate? Or should I get carbonation drops for the bottle and force carb the beer in the keg? Is there a better approach I am not considering? I usually force carb so I don't know if I might run into any issues with either of these approaches. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks in advanced.",Homebrewing
"Help me out: How to get more bicarbonate, but not wreck my pH? I use the Brewers Friend water calculator, and have a calibrated pH meter : Based on what I come up with there, and my Ward labs water profile (SF bay area: Sierra Nevada mountain snowmelt), I usually come in 'pretty close' to my pH target.  So *that's* good.

I usually brew darker beers, and often they could benefit from having more  HCO3 / bicarbonate in the mix to push up my RA: Easy enough to add in some baking soda to do that.  Problem is, it blows my pH way out of range.  I can add in some phosphoric/lactic acid to bring the pH back down, but this decreases the bicarbonate in the process basically negating things.

For example, on a recent quad brew, based on the target profile I selected recommended 265 ppm of HCO : Based on the existing malts, my water, and other salts, I was getting 54ppm with a pH of 5.46.  Adding 2.25 tsp of baking soda gets it up to 257 ppm (close enough), but my pH is now 5.84.  I can add 127ml of phosphoric acid to get the pH down to 5.4, but t hat drops the HCO back down to 47ppm: Worse than not doing any of this to begin with.

"How do you deal with changing water properties if your tap is surface water? I live in Minneapolis, and the tap water is taken out of the Mississippi River. The water usually tastes great - through a standard charcoal filter I prefer it to most bottled water. For a few weeks in the fall, the water is...funky.

This is the water I use to brew (charcoal filter+campden tablet), and while I get good feedback on my brews (and I like them, too!), they can be pretty variable due to the changing nature of the water. The water utility publishes monthly water reports, which include most of the information that's interesting to brewers, but these always lag behind my brews. So, if I brew something particularly great (like the Porter I'm currently drinking), I might not be able to reproduce it since I don't know enough about my water.

"3.5 year old US-05 slurry doing work! So, my first ever all grain brew that wasn't a kit was James Spencer's  Cream Ale from one of the BBR-episodes back in summer of 2016. When bottling it, I also bottled about 500ml of the trub along with it, since I'd heard about reusing it for another beer. I then stuck it in our second fridge down in the basement and forgot all about it. Until now that is. With guests coming this Christmas, we needed the space in the fridge for other stuff, so my SO had removed it from the fridge and left it on a table downstairs just before Christmas, where I found it on new years eve. 

Instead of throwing it out it, I figured it would be fun to see if there was still something alive in there, so I added a tablespoon for sugar to the bottle, shook it up and sealed it again. And what do you know, that same evening when I came back to it, the plastic bottle had firmed up, and sure enough, it had carbonated over just a few hours!

So, brewed up a 7 liter batch on the stovetop yesterday. Pale Malt and Fuggles smash beer, 1.042 OG. Here it is churning away about 30 hours after pitching:

"If I add table sugar (sucrose) to a mash will the enzymes convert it to glucose and fructose? I'm brewing with Philly Sour tomorrow. It produces more lactic acid when consuming glucose (and maybe other monosaccharides like fructose?). When it switches to more complex sugars, it ferments more like saccharomyces. I assume this includes disaccharides.

So, in the interest of making a more acidic beer, I'm thinking I can add the sugar I have on hand to the mash where alpha and (more likely) beta amylase will theoretically cleave the sucrose into glucose and fructose. Is this theory correct or am I missing something?",Homebrewing

"Recently ordered a Modern Times Homebrew Kit and asked for some help getting started as a first-time brewer Got this stellar response yesterday and it makes me so excited for my first try:

“Here's what I got from one of the brew managers,

One of the fascinating things about the brewing process is that there are countless ways to go about it, and no two brewers will produce the same exact beer! It can be as involved or laid back as you'd like the hobby to be, and that's the beauty of brewing.


The first text I always recommend for first-time brewers is John Palmer's book, How to Brew. This book can get fairly detailed, while staying relatively easy to follow for complete beginners.


In terms of equipment needed, there are endless ways to set up your brew station. One way to go about it, is to look for an all-grain starter pack which could include a mash / lauter tun, mill, boil kettle, burner, fermenter (carboy), sanitizer, tubing, thermometers, a wort chiller, and a method to package beer (bottles, keg, etc.) amongst other things. Check out morebeer.com for a 5 gallon starter kit and learning resources.


Also remember that ancient civilizations were making beer before any of this equipment existed, so don't sweat the details as you get started! The main thing to keep in mind is that you're extracting sugar from the crushed grain to feed to the yeast.


In terms of yeast, you can obsess over cell counts, viability, vitality, nutrients, and invest in a microscope, oxygen meters, etc. like we do here at the brewery...or you can just pitch the A38 Juice Yeast packet, and you'll definitely make beer!

"People with uni-tank style fermenters, what is your standard operating procedures when fermenting double dry-hopped beers? Hey all, I recently bought a 7 Gal SS Brewtech Uni-tank and currently have a NEIPA in it that I brewed the day before yesterday sitting at 68°F that still has the blow-off tube connected. The recipe I brewed calls for a 2 stage dry hop, with the first I hope to add in at the tail end of fermentation to take advantage of biotransformation from the yeast. I have a spunding valve, and a hop dropper setup, for lack of a better term, similar to [this](https://byo.com/article/the-hop-dropper/), that I can basically purge with co2 to dry-hop with minimal oxygen. 

I feel like I might be overthinking this, but I'm trying to figure out what the best practices for using this thing are. I have a few concerns in particular, like how to avoid a hop volcano when adding the hop pellets during active fermentation, and if I should spund towards the end to carbonate the beer, or use the carb stone in the tank. I also wonder when/if to drop the cone from yeast and hops, and about cold crashing. I don't have any plans to harvest the yeast on this batch, but I would like to know how I should do that in future batches. Any other tips would be much appreciated as well.

Sorry about the long post, but the more I try to think about it, the more overwhelmed I become. If anyone could share what they do, or any tips, or resources, it would really help me out. Until then I'll try to RDWHAHB. Cheers!",Homebrewing

"Getting started with kegging - CO2 regulator question Apologies for the noob question here.  I've always bottled my beer/cider in bottles, but recently decided to  start getting into kegging.

I got a  small little 4L keg and beer spear for it, and I have a ball lock  connection onto which I've placed one of these things: [https://www.amazon.ca/Beer-Keg-Charger-CO2-Dispenser/dp/B07NRD1BPJ](https://www.amazon.ca/Beer-Keg-Charger-CO2-Dispenser/dp/B07NRD1BPJ)

I  filled the keg with my finished beer and added a little priming sugar,  like I normally would with bottles. My question is - can I just attach  this pressure regulator and monitor the pressure in the keg as it  builds? Or do I NEED to have a CO2 cartridge attached to this thing? I don't want my precious CO2 to leak out where a CO2 cartridge should normally sit.

This stand gets used firstly to mill the grain, then during the mash it supports my HLT for sparge water, at the end of the boil it supports my CFC, then after clean up it acts as a drying rack.

Once fermentation is done, it supports my kegs whilst purging sanitiser through a daisy chain, then supports my fermenter whilst racking to kegs, then acts as a drying rack for the fermenter.

"Pepper Beer.....success!! So about 2 months ago, I tried a half batch of a pepper ale and it was good enough to scale up to a full 10gal batch, but I still wanted to tweak things a bit.  I wanted to address two specific characteristics....increase the heat very slightly,  and reduce the strong flavor of the Jalapeno peepers.   So, I scaled my recipe up, did not put any Jalapenos in the boil this time, cut the volume of jalapenos in half, and added back in a couple of Habaneros to give it that extra slight kick while reducing the Jalapeno flavor.  All peppers were put in the secondary this time for 7 days before kegging.  The changes did EXACTLY what I had hoped for!!  Happy new year....2021 is going to be a good year!!",Homebrewing

I pitched 2 packets of US-05 which usually is fine for bigger beers but as this is the biggest I've done I'm a bit curious if this means the yeast is just straight up too stressed. 

Is it worth adding yeast nutrient? I've got some with DAP on hand but usually that gets added during boil and I neglected to do so this time.

"If co2 is turned off while connected to an uncarbed keg, will the regulator eventually drop? Sorry, I really didn't know how to summarize the question properly. Anyway, after a disaster of a first attempt causing me to lose a whole co2 tank, I got everything hooked up and leak free. I hooked it up to a keg of uncarbed beer. Nervous from my last failure, I have been turning the co2 on while I'm home and able to check on it, and turning it off overnight ond when I'm gone for a long time. When it's on, pressure and co2 levels are stable, and when I go to turn it back on in the morning the levels all read the same as well (the psi may change slightly, but I didn't worry).

I travel for work and am gone for 2-3 days at a time. Obviously I'm not yet confident enough to leave the co2 on unattended that long, so I turn it off. 3 days later, I come home and check on it (everything is in the fridge) and the regulator readings (psi and co2 level) are at zero. Keg is fine and holding pressure. Turn the co2 on and the regulator readings jump back up along with the short rumbling sound of the co2 before going back silent.

Maybe it's just lack of experience. Everything seems fine. I'm pretty confident I don't have leaks. I assume that all the co2 left when I shut it off is absorbed into the beer and that's why, but my previous mishap has made me more wary than I probably should be.",Homebrewing

"2020 Brewing Cost Breakdown This year was my first full year homebrewing and I wanted to share my cost breakdown for others who may be just getting into the hobby. I was curious how much I was spending per beer after factoring all the miscellaneous costs so I went through my credit card transactions and Amazon orders to generate a breakdown. I had a feeling it was higher than expected but safe to say I was surprised.

For context, I started the year with an all-grain BIAB 5 gallon setup and had already purchased the basics (kettle, bottles, propane burner) so those are not included. I upgraded to kegs in February, which is a large part of the expenses for the year. I brew once or twice a month and order all my supplies from online suppliers.

## Batches brewed

|*Style*|*Quantity*|
|:-|:-|
|Hazy IPA|5|
|Porter|1|
|Pilsner|1|
|Weizenbock|1|
|Imperial Red|1|
|Cream Ale|1|
|Festbier|1|
|Mexican Lager|1|
|Belgian Strong Dark|1|
|Bock|1|
|Wit|1|
|Bitter|1|
|Total|16|

My main goal for the year was to brew lots of new styles and also go deep on a specific recipe (hazy IPA).  I’d say based on these numbers that I achieved that.

Now to the fun part...

## Costs

|*Vendor/Category*|*Cost*|
|:-|:-|
|MoreBeer|$883.18|
|Amazon|$902.73|
|Kegs|$200.00|
|Kegerator|$300.00|
|C02|$203.11|
|Yakima Valley Hops|$60.98|
|Northern Brewer|$490.67|
|Mini fridge|$60|
|Propane|$80|
|Total|$3,180.67|

&amp;#x200B;

Which comes out to...

|Cost Per Batch|$198.79|
|:-|:-|
|Cost Per Gallon|$39.76|
|Cost Per Beer (12oz)|$3.75|

&amp;#x200B;

MoreBeer is my primary ingredients vendor but I occasionally use Northern Brewer if MoreBeer doesn’t have what I need in stock. Amazon is what I use to get things shipped quickly but I’ve been trying to move away from Amazon if possible. As a further breakdown on Amazon, I purchased 57 items for an average of $16. I was really surprised by how much I bought on Amazon and it really goes to show that those small, one-off purchases can really add up.

For kegs, I now have two kegerators with three taps total and capacity to refrigerate four kegs. The first one I got off Craigslist with the CO2 tank, regulator and two ball lock kegs for only $300. The second one was loaned to me by a friend. I also got 6 pin lock kegs on Craigslist for $200. Lastly, I found a perfect mini fridge for $60 to ferment in.

For CO2, costs include the deposit for a second tank so refills were \~$30 each. Propane costs are estimated because I swap my tanks at the local Ace and I usually purchased other things on the same transaction.

I also should call out that I bought a grain mill and a 50lb sack of pale malt that is still being delivered. Those costs are included here but haven’t been used yet.

The $3.75 per beer number is much higher than I expected and doesn’t even factor in labor costs. That’s $22 a six pack... ouch. Also $200 per batch is really eye opening considering my material costs for grain, hops and yeast are \~$60 so that’s the number I was orienting around in my mental calculations. It goes to show that this really is an expensive hobby if you aren’t careful.

Going into next year, I predict that most of the equipment I have already will make the cost per batch much lower. I bought a grain mill and now that I have a good estimate for supplies, I can order things in bulk to save money. I also will be focusing more on costs now that I have my process dialed in and already have most of the random gear. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading and happy new year!",Homebrewing

1. Would I need to buy C02 bottles?
I know that the beer would carb itself in the keg from fermentation but do you still need c02 to dispense the beer?

2. How much quicker is the fermentation? 
I read that the yeast ferments the wort much quicker under pressure but not sure how much quicker, is there some sort of formula or online calculator or would just need to keep taking gravity readings?

3. How do you dry hop beer in these?

"Looking for a Palm / Koninck / amber recipe Ok, this might sound kinda stupid, but I have searched for hours and couldn't find it, so maybe there's someone here who has one ready.

I want to brew a belgian Amber like Palm or De Koninck, but since amber isn't really a separate beer style, it's very hard to find recipes for it.

Anyone here who could help me? I have some CaraAmber 70EBC malt I'd like to use, also enough pilsner / pale / munich malts, as wel as Mangrove Jacks M41, M21 and M15 yeast and some generic Hallertau and Fuggles hop.

"Question about mash thickness using a K-RIMS setup. Last week I had the epiphany I had nearly all the equipment to do a gravity-fed K-RIMS setup, so why not give it a shot?  Been doing single vessel BIAB up until now.  Just ported the Blichmann AutoSparge into my spare kettle, hooked everything up with my pump, seems to be doing what it should with water.

While have no *concern* over this question, the theory behind it piqued my interest.

Let's say you have 16 lbs of grain and want to do full volume / no sparge.  That requires 'roughly' 8 gal / 32 quarts of water, giving you a 2:1 water to grist ratio : aka 'very thin' (nothing wrong with that IMO).

MY QUESTION:  Based on what I understand from a K-RIMS setup, you split your water volume in half, so you start with half in the mash tun, and the other half in the boil kettle,  henceforth recirculate.  This means at any one point in time, only 16 quarts are sitting with the 16 lbs of grain, giving more of a 1:1 ratio.

Is this logic correct?  Or really, is it *still* considered 2:1, based on the recirculation that's happening?

Thoughts/opinions appreciated.",Homebrewing

This looks a little too fine to me based on what I've seen, but I'm hoping to get input from people with more experience than me.

My lesson learned from this is that I should have bought an extra pound or so of grain to help figure out settings, or at least stopped to see how it was going. Oh well, live and learn!

Also, I set up my mill spacing using a .035 feeler gauge, leaving a little extra room.  The markings on the rollers don't line up each other, or appropriately with the numbers on the mill.  Just curious if anyone has seen something similar.

"Recommendations for and upgrade Hey brewers! 

I've been brewing for a little while now, and looking to improve. And I'm debating what to upgrade. I have a norther brewer bucket kit, with the 5 gallon brew kettle. So I'm doing partial boils on the stove. I already do yeast starters and have a jaded chiller. So I'm thinking to upgrade my brew kettle. https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/10-gal-megapot-1-2 seems like a good bang for the buck, full boils and with the 10 gal I can see doing BIAB in the short future. 

But that's my thoughts and I wanted to ask yours. I'm looking to improve clarity, meanings not as hazy and not as dark. Most of what I brew is ales, pale ales specifically. I have been adding the malt (dme) additions where I just add half for the full boils time and add the rest half way through. That's helped lighten up the color, but I might be sacrificing sugars. 

So based on this info, do you think the kettle is the right move? Or should I look in another direction, fermentation equipment instead?

"Finally brewed our first all grain beer! SMaSH IPA with Maris Otter and Mosaic. For my birthday back in September, the girlfriend and I both went in on a Anvil Foundry 10gal system as a present. As avid beer lovers and both having wanted to brew for a long time, we figured this would be a good first system (I realize now it's pretty gnarly haha). 

To start, here is the [finished product](https://i.imgur.com/mMrhzEX.jpg). Here is an [unedited photo](https://i.imgur.com/OOXNn0A.jpg) for real reference ;) As it has sat in the keg it has cleared up immensely. 

Brew day went surprisingly well for our first time! There were definitely a few hiccups throughout the process, however, that was expected. Start to finish was about 6 1/2 hours. Some funny things we messed up on;


- The hoses attached to the wort chiller were not tight enough thus it shot water all throughout our kitchen.
- Multiple times the exit hose on the wort chiller left the sink (we eventually taped it down) spraying water all over our kitchen
- We used an old fermentation bucket I was gifted as a sanitizing bucket - unfortunately, the seal around the spigot leaked which spilled water all over our kitchen floor (common theme here huh?)

This takes the cake for the dumbest thing though... and I take full responsibility for my negligence! 

- The recipe stated to add 2oz of mosaic as a dry hop at 5 days. To me, this meant add the hops *five days after fermentation started*. It wasn't until day 3 of the dry hop I realized I messed up... oh well, learn for the next time! 

The beer itself turned out wonderful (I think it definitely tastes better since it's home brewed - in reality, it may not be too good lol). It has great carbonation, a nice color, and is relatively clear. 

Here's the details and recipe we used.

- 13lbs Maris Otter Pale
- 1oz Mosaic as FWH
- 0.75oz Mosaic at 10mins
- 1oz Mosaic at 5mins
- 1oz Mosaic at flameout
- 2oz Mosaic at 5 days (where I messed up)

For the recipe the target OG was 1.059 and final was 1.011 for an ABV of ~ 6.4%. 

Our OG came out at 1.066 and final was 1.016 for an ABV of ~ 6.5%

For anyone curious, we brewed this in a 2 bedroom apartment. Since space is tight, that was a major determining factor in getting the Foundry. [You can see our set up here during the wort chill!](https://streamable.com/fsc78k)

2) I'm using a sanitizer called Amber Dyne. I'm 100% sure I used the correct strength but I did not rinse anything after sanitizing. Was that a big mistake?

Even once I am sure I have emptied it, when I go to use it again there is always a fair amount of water in the line.

"Confused! Fermentation and bubbling, but FG not dropping Hey all, here to ask about some bizarre yeast activity that I can't quite explain. I've got slow but moderate experience homebrewing (about 20 batches over 5+ years) and have never seen anything like this, nor could I find a similar post on our many forums. 

I brewed this [NE IPA](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/363082/avg-perfect-northeast-ipa-neipa-) about 3 weeks ago. My OG came in on the high side, above 1.07, but I had a few too many grains and was a bit short on volume, so I wasn't too worried about it. Pitched from a smack pack, and fermentation started just fine about 18 hours post-pitch.

Everything seems normal, then 3 days after fermentation starts I do dry hop 1: sanitize, grab beer for gravity reading with baster, toss hops in, close it up. **Gravity=1.028**, right where I'd expect. 

This is where it gets weird. I check on it the next day... no fermentation activity. RDWHAHB, I say. Checking it daily.

3 days pass (for those keeping track, a week after brew day now), no activity. I suspect a stuck fermentation so I give it a swirl. We're up and running again! Fermentation activity again. 

1 day later, I do dry hop 2. **Gravity=1.024**. Dropping... sorta. I'm surprised because I am seeing bubbles every 10 seconds or so and would expect a faster rate of change on the gravity. 

Fast forward a week. Checking daily and seeing consistent fermentation activity, which isn't slowing down. Bubbles every 10 seconds or so, sometimes every 7. 

I check gravity again yesterday because I'm impatient to keg/bottle. **Gravity=1.022**. 

I've tasted my samples and visually inspected the bucket, no signs of infection. Fermenter is in my basement, and temps are pretty consistent.

In October I brewed 21 litres of basic APA with Simcoe and Mosaic hops. I boiled 20g of Simcoe for 70 minutes, dry hopped with 50g of Mosaic for 7 days. The end product is weaker than calculated because I added more sparge water but I don't mind about that. About the taste, it has the nice taste of Mosaic, but it has a very strong, almost overpowering bitterness to it, even after a month in the bottle. Might it be the Simcoe? Did I boil too much or too long? Bear in mind that I'm rookie, brewed maybe 4 beers, but I try and be as precise as I can. Also, I'm Hungarian, English is not my mother's tongue, so apologies for any misunderstanding.

"Experimental sour beer with sourdough starter I recently brewed an experimental batch of sour beer using only sourdough starter to ferment. I haven't seen too much discussion here on how to make a clean vs. sour beer with sourdough, although it may be obvious to some. The main idea is to add no hops at all on the hot side, so as to not inhibit the lacto in the sourdough starter, and then to add dry hops once the beer reaches the desired sourness. The end result is a tart beer that doesn't taste all too bad and is slightly more complex than a typical kettle sour. 


For my beer, I stuck with a simple grain bill, dry hopped with motueka at day 7 and added some pureed cranberries. I would say that this produced a beer that is a bit too tart, so it may better to dry hop earlier than day 7. I also made a large yeast starter on the stir plate using a typical recipe, but added 100g sourdough starter rather than yeast. Here's a photo of the result next to a sourdough loaf and the starter that spawned both the beer and the bread: https://i.imgur.com/B05F0xc.jpg.

36h before brewing, make a 1500 mL yeast starter, as normal except yeast replaced with ~100g of sourdough starter

"Muddy Brown NEIPA What Went Wrong??? Hi guys,

I've got quite a few brews under my belt and I'm puzzled by what may have caused this. The problems are, very little hop aroma, brown instead of light yellow and maybe acetaldehyde on the pallete. Recipe was as follows.

2kg light DME
0.43kg rolled oats
0.43kg flaked wheat
0.3kg pale malt
Yeast nutrient
100 grams mosaic dry hopped
100 grams Citra dry hopped
S-04

I tried some new methods for my brew day instead of the normal all grain method I usually use (water restrictions in NZ)

- mash grains at 69 degrees for an hour in 4L water
- dissolve 2kg DME in remaining water
- add yeast nutrient
- boil for 15 minutes (no hop additions)
- melt 2kg ice directly into boil
- transfer to keg with floating dip tube for fermentation and top up to 15L fermenter volume
- starting temp was 22 degrees on my thermometer and when I put in the ferm chamber it read ~25 degrees, pitched S-04 as I didnt realise. Im wondering if the wort wasn't properly mixed at this stage.
- set ferm chamber to 18 degrees, probe taped to side of keg
- very active ferment within 24 hours. Dry hopped on day 3, by then fermenter had mainly stopped bubbling. Raised temp to 22 degrees, blew into blow off tube to check keg properly sealed. Ferment seemed done by the week, so I moved to kegerator where i pulled a sample warm to inspect beer. I was left with description above.

This happened yesterday and I've got it on the gas at the moment to see if there's any change over the next few days. My first thought is post ferment oxidation however I can't see that being a problem if I dry hopped during active fermentation. The potential problems I can think of are below.

- fermentation was 99% done after 3 days so when I dry hopped I oxidised the beer. However I'm not getting the typical cardboard flavors, more the discolouration and loss of hop aroma
- infection, I havent had one before and these all feel like familiar off tastes from my earlier brewing days.
- chlorine from tap water. This hasn't been a problem before but I thought I'd throw it in the mix. Does this discolour beer?
- off colour caused by DME, it went into the fermenter very dark, though I thought it would lighten up.
- I didn't check gravity, maybe fermentation wasn't over.
- off flavors may be caused by high pitching temperature.
- change of process has made me unknowingly do something wrong.

Is there anything else I've missed here. The main one I'm thinking is the high pitch temp, does S-04 throw off flavors at those temps (25-26 celsius). All help is welcomed, im stumped and this beer is gross, any advice for next time will be much welcomed.

Cheers

"FFS - I thought I solved my problem with leaking disconnects. Now my safety valve started leaking This shit is driving me insane. I *sick and tired* of having gas leaks and/or worrying about gas leaks. I replaced the normal ball-lock disconnects with ones that have only three locating balls (instead of four arranged in a pattern that is far too easy to simply tilt with your hand and cause a leak). So far, that has improved my set up.

I thought it was sorted. Until I open up the fridge today and hear a hissing sound. Now, it's the fucking screw-in Corny style safety valve that leaks. Somehow, it has started leaking halfway through a fermentation, after being perfectly fine for the 14 previous runs.

I have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on fittings, lines and valves. And still I do not trust a single one of them. They can't be trusted, at all from what I have seen. What does everyone else to to prevent leaks in their system? Initially I blamed the Corny style posts and disconnects. I still do. But it's seemingly even more than that. Nothing can be trusted.

"Help figuring out a curious flavor in one of my sours? Earlier this year my sister asked me for a sour beer for her birthday, which I happily made her. I had never before worked with lacto, so I thought this was a good time to use her as a test subject (as she drinks exclusively sours). The recipe was as follows: 

1:1 Malted and raw (flaked) wheat to an OG of 1.046

Kettle soured with WLP672 for 3 days at 30C (IIRC)

One single hop cone in boil

Fermented with Voss, Then with BE134 as the Voss finished a it higher than intended

That was just over half a year ago, and it was enjoyed greatly both by her and her friends. I was curious about the pH, as I didn't have proper pH measuring equipment at the time, so she set the last bottle my way. I only needed a small sample for the test, so I drank the rest, and wow.

Basically, it tastes nothing like normal beer. Instead, it has a fairly intense pastry flavor, like cinnamon roll dough with some vanilla and fruit. Really weird, but pretty nice.

"Weird aftertaste in beer I have filled my keg with a couple of cheap lager kits. (I was desperately trying to fill my bar before Christmas) The beer has an unusual aftertaste that I struggle to describe. I have tasted quite a lot of bad homebrew, mostly of my own making, and know when beer has been infected or oxidised and I’m not sure this is the case with mine. 
My lager is crystal clear with good carbonation and has a predominant malt flavour. I expected this as it obviously hasn’t had hops boiled in it. However, after the sweet beery flavour fades, my beer tastes like the smell of WD40. The taste is washed away with every sip but after I finish a pint all I can taste is blood.

"Am I Screwed? I'm pretty sure I know the answer but figured I'd ask before tossing all this work.  I am very new to this and not sure what went wrong.

I started this batch of cider in June and used sodium metabisulfate to kill the wild yeast before adding Lalvin D-47.  I racked it after five weeks and it was very clear and had a brix of around 5 (should have written it down but didn't, doh!).  I was careful to sanitize everything and gave the buckets a thorough scrub and sani before adding the cider back in.  I did mess up on this step and thoughtlessly poured the cider back in the bucket instead of using the racking cane!  Oofta.  

Anyways, fast forward to today and I open the bucket up.  Why did I let the cider go for 6 more months?  Because I don't know what I'm doing and I read on a forum somewhere that that was okay.   It looks funky AF.  White floaties and a bit of a smell.  Also, it is cloudy now.  Is it garbage?  Am I accidentally making vinegar?

"Thoughts on a 240V DigiMash vs an Anvil Foundry? To start off with, I'm a propane/BIAB guy right now, but I'm pretty dead set to go electric this year and have an electrician lined up and ready to run the 240 line whenever I need it.

I've been cross shopping basically all the sub-$500 all-in-one systems and had been leaning toward a Foundry for a while until I thought about all the gear I already own that the foundry comes with or is optional on a brewzilla, i.e. a pump, tubing, immersion chiller, whirlpool arm, hop spider, and wort aerator that could do dual duty as a recirc tube with a slight modification.

I randomly stumbled across the DigiMash when I was perusing morebeer's site, and from what I understand it's basically a brewzilla without the automatic step mashing feature, integrated pump, or chiller, but with the gear I already have, I shouldn't really need those things either.

Given what I already own, at $240 for the 240v version plus $20 for the neoprene jacket, is there really any reason to shell out for one of the fuller featured systems?  As much as I like it, even the cheapest foundry comes in $100 more than that, and I'm not really seeing the value there aside from the ability to run on 120 which I don't plan on doing.  Should I just save the money and invest it in the necessary electrical work?",Homebrewing

"pH meters that don't suck Hi all!

I'm a bit lost and confused as to why pH meters are so unreliable.

They all seems to expire in different ways much sooner than I would expect. Even though I always take appropriate care of them.

Anyway, I recently did some research on here, and online, and settled on the Milwaukee MW102. 
So excited.

Arrives. Doesn't calibrate, takes an eternity to move between pH values. To the point where it would literally turn off first before reaching a new buffer.

Am I missing something?
Even on the youtube video it takes a good 2 minutes to move between 7 &amp; 4.

Anyway I've sent it back. I think possibly the electrodes faulty on arrival, now I'm unconvinced in the brand

"'Raspberry Beret' Mead and Cherry Bomb Kvass Raspberry Beret and Cherry Bomb have been ideas I've been kicking around, and now that I have proper equipment I decided to make them both! These are currently the best I've ever done in terms of homebrewing, and I was able to have both of these ready within a weeks time! 

The mead, named after Raspberry Beret by Prince, is made with four 8 oz packs of raspberries. I boil them with the water I use for the mead itself, and added in a handful and a half of dried hibiscus. In the future I will reduce the amount of hibiscus I use, but this turned out fine and thankfully it wasn't enough to overpower the raspberries. Plus, I like the taste of hibiscus. Anyways, strain out any of the seeds or hibiscus petals and pour into your vessel. I used a 4:1 ratio of water and honey, it ended up being about two and a half liters in total. I kept it fermenting for 5 days, transferred it to a different container, and aged it for 2 days. What you end up with in the end is a mead that is slightly effervescent, tart from the raspberries but the sweetness balances it out. Once again, I was worried that I added too much hibiscus but it doesn't overpower the raspberries.

Cherry Bomb, named after the song by Joan Jett, is basically just a modified kvass. In case you haven't heard of it, kvass is a slavic beverage made from stale dark bread. Low abv and tasting like a beer, it's usually made with an eyballed handful or two of raisins, but with a suggestion from my girlfriend, I swapped those out for dried cherries. The fermentation is shorter than my young mead, only 2 days and it's ready to drink.
The best way to describe it is that it's absolutely delightful. It tastes more like a lightly flavored cherry soda than anything, but it's not so sweet so as to hit your stomach like a brick. Just a very refreshing low abv beverage!",Homebrewing

"Post your best recipe of 2020! We've nearly made it, people.  I'm trying to spend the last couple of days reflecting on some of the good things that came out of this year.  Certainly having this hobby, and wonderful homebrew to get through the pandemic was a real bright spot.  This year I focused on improving the use of coffee in beer, and playing with smoked malts.  I still don't like Rauchbier.  

So what was your best recipe from this year?  Ideally post an original, one you came up with, or refined this year. Mine was a heretical Peat-smoked Scottish Export 90/- that I did three iterations of, here's where it ended up:

BJCP Heresy - 14C Scottish Export (6.5 gallons)  
1.060 OG, 1.016 FG (6% abv)

11lbs Golden Promise 75%  
1lb Metolius / Munich I 7%  
12oz Opal 44 5% (alternatively, use more 50-70L caramel)  
10oz Medium Crystal (Simpsons) 4%  
8oz Shaniko White Wheat 3.5%  
6oz Aromatic Malt 3%  
2.5oz Peat Smoked Malt 1.1% (easy does it, in my iterations this was the sweet spot!)  
1.5oz Blackprinz / Carafa (for color, adjust to your liking)

Keep your salts modest, I do 4g CaCl and 2g Gypsum into my near-RO tap water  
Mash @ 155F for 60 mins  
I mash out at 168 in the last 5 minutes and hold there for a bit while I start my sparge @ 172.

I **highly** recommend the 120+ minute boil for this style!  It really makes the rich, sweet flavors and deep color come out.  

1oz EKG @ 60 mins for 18 IBU

Chill to 64F and pitch Tartan / Scottish McEwan strain.  
This is a bit higher gravity for 200B cell pitches with 5.75+ gallons in the fermenter, so I'd recommend a vitality starter (draw off some sweet wort after mashing and get it bubbling before pitching) or a small 1L starter to hit ~275B cells.  Hold primary temp to 65 through primary if possible.  It can really attenuate and kick off esters above 68.  

There's some literature about forced under-attenuation in this style, but I'd rather just mash high and let the yeast finish out.

If you enjoy scotch, and scotch ale, you'll love this beer.  I am not crazy about smoked beers, I avoid them unless they are done very tastefully.  BJCP judges will draw and quarter you until you shout ""FREEDOM!"" but I swear this is the style where a very modest peat-smoked malt addition belongs, and it complements the smooth sweetness very well.

"High Gravity / Extract / Dry Yeast fermenting Third attempt brewing high gravity (OG 1.097 / 10.4% ABV per the recipe sheet). This actually seems to be going OK, so far. 5 gallon recipe.  Two weeks (and counting) since brew day.

Dry yeast - Mangrove Jack's Belgian M41.  Tolerant to 12%. [Recipe was a mail-order kit](https://boomchugalug.com/products/life-is-beautiful-christmas-ale-la-vie-est-belle-biere-de-noel-beer-brewing-extract-recipe-kit).  Didn't think about buying extra yeast. Most resources advise against starters with dry yeast, but I made a 2L anyhow.  Pitched the whole thing so it was also part of my top-off water (and no lost yeast cells).

Temperature is around 78°F (""good"" range for the yeast).

Used a blow-off tube and 6.5 gallon carboy.  Learned that lesson after my first high gravity attempt (airlock clogged and squirted beer on the ceiling before blowing it across the room).  High krausen happened within 18 hours.  It pushed a little foam into the tube, but not so much to push any out the other end.

After a week, I racked into a 6.5 gallon bucket with a normal air lock.  Gravity dropped to around 1.040.

I read somewhere rousing the yeast once or twice a day can be beneficial to reach target attenuation.  So I've been rocking the bucket, lid on, air lock in place, to get the liquid to swirl.  It's got a CO2 blanket over the beer, so oxidizing isn't an issue, right?

After week #2, the air lock is still bubbling about once every 20 seconds.  It's more or less been on that same pace since racking it.  I haven't taken another gravity reading.  No reason to open the bucket.  Obviously still fermenting, and the gas smells right (i.e. not infected).

If I grind the citrus fresh along with its zest it ferments well. If I grind the frozen pulp it also ferments well (frozen fruits release more juice as ice crystals break the cell membranes). But if I add frozen zest all fermenting activity is inhibited and the brew just gets spoiled and sour in few days.

I guess there is something about frozen zest -- maybe it releases some kind of antibacterial compounds during freezing? I couldn't find any explanations for this online.

Finally, if I want to carbonate beer, should I set it to like 20-25psi and then reduce before serving in the keg?

"Clean a spunding valve? So my last brew was a success. See post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/jhxr5e/no_boil_graff_results/). Only issue was a little bit of hop astringent flavor that faded a couple weeks in. 

Decided to do it again but to simplify the process even further. This one was no boil and no separate fermentation. Everything went into a 5ga keg with a floating dip tube. Dry hopped 1oz fuggle into a mesh container. Pitched dry kveik (I rehydrated it in warm tap water into a sanitized bowl. I figured I use tap water during palmer method so I shouldn't need to boil the pitching water either...)

Then I attached a spunding valve and set it in my bathtub for a week. It's been fermenting great except during high krausen it spit a bunch of liquid out through the valve. It does make me nervous that this thing is by definition in contact w the wort. is there a way to clean this?   The valve was $8 so no huge loss. The brass T and gauge were the bigger investment. So My current thought is just to throw away the valve itself and soak the tube and gauge in cbw followed by sanitizer.

I think next time I'll use a second keg as a blow off container and attach the spunding valve to it to avoid this issue in the first place.",Homebrewing

"Boosting ABV with table sugar I’ve read about boosting ABV with table sugar / other sugars, and decided to add 1lb of table sugar directly to my fermenter for a high ABV milk stout.

I’m thinking I probably should have dissolved the sugar some warm water first like I do for bottling. Are the yeast going to ignore all of the sugar, since I watched it just drop to the bottom of my carboy, or will they get to it anyways?

"Is this pellicile or yeast? For some background, this is apple cider fermented with red star champaigne yeast. It has sat in primary fermentor for 2 weeks. Original gravity was 1.060 and current gravity is 0.990. Disinfected with campden tablets and added some pectinase.

A few days ago I went to take a closer look after all the foam from juicing the apple with a juicer that had subsided/eaten up by the yeast/fell out to the bottom and I noticed that there was this super thin film like thing on top. It doesnt look infected like other photos I went to search online and it doesnt have any off smells or tastes on sampling.

"Troubleshooting oxidization in keg Howdy - I’m trying to troubleshoot what I suspect is an oxidization problem with my last two kegged beers. I can’t pressure transfer due to my fermenter, but this has been my process for a dozen prior brews, non of them exhibited this issue. 

Clean and sanitize keg, put on gas and fill with co2, purge multiple times, pop the top just enough to get the beer line in, gravity feed the beer into the keg, gas on, purge a few more times. The only variable has been I got new CO2 from airgas.

Last two beers, one a kolsch, one a spiced holiday dark beer, both tasted fine on day 1 &amp; 2, but by day 3 they were bitter, wet cardboard tasting. The prior batches were almost exclusively West Coast IPA and NEIPA, and I never had an issue with what should be more volatile brews. 

I’ve also torn down my entire draft system, cleaned it all and put it back together after the last batch.

Any troubleshooting would be hugely appreciated.",Homebrewing

"Plastic Taste After Priming? Recently finished a Holiday Spiced Ale from Northern Brewer (it’s basically a Scottish Ale with Mulling Spice). It was an extract kit. I tasted it every step of the way and didn’t notice anything off. About 2 weeks ago I racked into a bottling bucket (this is the only time the beer has been in anything plastic) and added my table sugar (boiled in 2 cups of water, cooled and added to the beer). Then bottled and let it sit in the basement. It was in the bucket maybe 30 minutes tops. Popped one open today - perfectly carbonated - but it has a very plastic aftertaste. Could it have been the bucket? I would assume if it was my water I would have noticed the taste before this, but this is my first brew, so what do I know ;) I’m also reading Brett can cause a plastic/bandaid flavor. It’s very subtle, but it’s there. 

I cleaned everything with C-Brite and sterilized with Star-San. Fermented in a glass carboy. Could it work itself out or should I just make beer soap with all this?",Homebrewing

"Help with Lagers So I've been brewing for a long time, but lately I've noticed that my lagers come out ""yeasty"" (quotes for a reason). I have a Czech pils on tap right now which has the same issue, though otherwise good. For Christmas I filled a gallon keg to take to my father and a 16 oz twistee to ship to my brother. Because of the size of the keg, my father and I drank it at about 45°F (outside temperature that day) and it tasted amazingly crisp. I asked my brother and he said he only detected a faint off flavor that he only noticed because I asked him to look for it.

Some details: initial fermentation at 50°F, raised to 64°F after 5 days for a 4 day rest, then lagered at 30-35°F for about 4-5 weeks. OG 1.054, FG 1.009 using Wyeast 2278. After filling the keg and can, they sat on the counter overnight at 65-70°F.

So I am wondering if maybe I have been having DMS issues and not realizing it because I wasn't good at identifying it, or if somehow the off gassing during filling scrubbed some kind of off flavor? I just drank a beer off the tap and it still had the ""yeasty"" flavor that might just be DMS. 

But if this is DMS, then why isn't my 4 day rest enough? Why does it seem to not be there when I sample during kegging? I had become convinced I had oxidation issues during cold crashing, but now I am not so sure.

"HomeCraft Mini Keg So my wife bought me a HomeCraft mini keg for Christmas. 5l capacity. Nice gift considering my wife knows I enjoy making home brew and she doesn’t know a lick about it.

The little bastards in there kept eating away at the sugar in my supposed syrupy dessert beer!  

It was quite the letdown when I went to pop a bottle open in front of a crowd on Christmas' eve...first an Earth-shattering \*POP\*, several seconds of anticipation, and then a beer geyser from the bottle!  

After pouring out the remaining beer in the bottle, I found a lovely and fairly strong maple - chocolate - coffee (?) stout.  More bitter than a Guinness on the first sip, but a warmth of chocolate comes over and finishes with a gentle maple taste.  Completely different to the hooch it was several months ago!

"I have an unpopular preference that requires an innovative solution. Let's cut to it... I like certain beers at or around room temperature. Particular wheats, spicy porters, or hoppier barley wines, to name a few. That's my preference, and I accept the fact I'm in the minority.

That aside: I have a repurposed fridge kegerator. 10lbs tank, 3 way manifold, and several kegs I swap out as things happen (Usually 5gal corny ball, and two 2.5gal torpedos stacked). To keep 5gal room temp, I swapped one of the faucets with a gas in, set the keg outside the fridge, and popped a picnic tap on it. Problem is, I'm not sure how to plug up the space between what was my 7/8"" faucet and is now my 9/16"" tube. I just have a bunch of extra rubber gloves and electrical tape stuffed in it, right now.

Is there a smarter way to do this, or an adapter? I don't always want a room temp beer, but on such an occasion I make something I'd prefer to be such, I'd like a quick way to swap one in or out.",Homebrewing

I got into Kegs, but I don't have somewhere to put a Fridge or bar also I maybe moving so... ya. I can store all the CO2 and keg gear in the shed out of the way when not in use. So the plan was big kegs and transfer small 5lt kegs for the fridge with tap on the keg, with CO2 bulbs or Soda stream I can refill them from a bigger CO2 in the shed.  I don't drink by myself or in large amount so the mini kegs are perfect for me, with larger ones in the shed I can transfer the homebrew in as needed.  
I wanted something fancier/cool for having people over and also bringing to drinks with friends. That can be put away when not in use. Given Covid myself and the two friends I meet up with are missing taps and pints (when safe) so I came up with of these taps. Gave them a test with my GF and her room mates over Christmas it went down great and was easy to stick in the car with a cooler box loaded with ice blocks and two 5lt kegs.

"The annual tradition of canning 5 gallons of starter. Every year I can 5 gallons of starter wort. It takes a few hours, and is perfect to do over Christmas, because there's a lot of sitting around anyway. [Here's the process in action](https://i.imgur.com/DGoT5tJ.jpg)

This is my technique:

* 7.5 pounds of 2-row
* Collect 7 gallons of water.
* Add 10 quarts of 168-170 degree water, and mash in. Target temp is 150 degrees, lower is better.
* Collect the first runnings
* Sparge with 2.0 gallons of water
* Sparge again with 2.5 gallons water until 5 gallons is reached.


The boil
* I usually boil for 15-20 mins to get some of the sulfur compounds to evolve off.


Canning:
* I can in 1/2 gallon jars, and optionally, add 1/2 teaspoon of yeast nutrient to the jars before canning.
* Can at 15 pounds for 15 minutes.
* Cool, ensure the seal is good (test the dimple in the top to ensure it's depressed), and store in safe place.",Homebrewing

"Farmhouse ale recipe help Happy holidays all.  I was gifted some equipment that I can finally dedicate to mixed fermentations, and I have been itching to make a farmhouse ale with Omega C2C saison/Brett yeast.  

I will likely stray from style guidelines in some ways, but I’d like to stay true to the idea of the yeast and Brett being the stars of the show in terms of flavor.  I would like to add at least some citrus/fruit flavor via hopping with Motueka.

My grain bill is going to be 70% Pilsner, 18% spelt, and 11% flaked wheat.  For a 5 gallon batch, I was going to shoot for 16IBUs with 0.75 oz of Motueka at 10 mins and 5 mins, and then do a whirlpool with 1.5 oz of Motueka.  No dry hop.  

Does this sound like a hopping schedule that will give a hint of Motueka’s flavor while letting the yeast do their thing?  I almost exclusively brew NEIPAs so I am just used to hopping at extreme rates.  

Other info: looking to ferment in the 70s for a few weeks and then let it sit in primary for 4 months.  Bottle it and let that condition for another 2 months (6 months grain to glass).

"New Setup Help (fermenter questions) I've been brewing off and on since 2012. My current setup involves a propane burner that I use outside with a 10 gallon pot, an 8 gallon pot for heating water, a water cooler mash tun and 3 6.5 gallon glass carboys and 3 5 gallon glass carboys. Why so many carboys? I don't know. I think I got some as a gift.

Anyway, I want to get away from the carboys. Cleaning the auto siphon stinks. Worrying about when I need to replace the siphon because of possible contamination causes me anxiety. 

I've done some research into cost effective alternatives and I seem to have landed on the Anvil 7.5 gallon stainless steel bucket fermenters. My problem is that I still think I'd need to use the 5 gallon carboys I have to dry hop in secondary. As alternatives I've looked at dry hopping in the keg, but that's not very appealing to me. I'm not sure how else I'd do it, though, without buying a smaller stainless fermenter (which Anvil sells a 4 gallon.... not quite big enough), or upgrading to a true conical like the SS Brewtech, Anvil, or Spike.

Things that I don't do now that I might want to in the future would be washing yeast and temp control beyond a wet t-shirt...

"Yeast Harvest from Conicals. Hello and happy holidays! I recently (three months ago) switched to grainfather conical fermenters. I'm thoroughly enjoying them but only recently started using them to harvest yeast.

"Long time brewer...first time souring. I did quite a bit of research on kettle souring (using Goodbelly juice), and decide to give it a shot.  Brew day went well, transferred to boil kettle, boiled 10 min, and cooked quickly to 95F.  I went to pre-acidify the wort down to a target of about 4.5 ph, but ran short of lactic acid and ended up around 5.2ish.  By now I was committed,  so I pitched a quart of Goodbelly, blanketed with CO2, and covered top of kettle.  about 48hrs later, and PH is only down to about 4.15....looking to get to 3.2 to 3.6 range.   Starting to wonder its stalling, or if I am just being impatient. Any words of wisdom from any of you souring experts out there??  For reference,  I am doing 10gal batch of Berliner Weisse and I am sitting at my preboil volume of 13gal right now.",Homebrewing
"I started to rebuild my brewery to feature HERMS and automation with BruControl. I thought I'd share some of the process here.
I bought two new 15 gal kettles from Ss Brewtech and had BrewPi's coils and heating elements put into it. Punching out the holes for the elements and coil was nerve wrecking, but it turned out fine and does not leak, as far as I can tell.

Now I am designing the electrical enclosure. I'm using a 16x8x6 electrical enclosure cabinet/wall box. I needed an enclosure that was not too deep, as the kettle will be in front of it and I do not have too much space on my walls anymore.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CI-9Z5VF5Of/?igshid=b62u3cmnmgdr

When wiring the enclosure I've taken much care into wiring with thick enough cables, so that in theory I can just upgrade with a juicier element when I want without rewiring. I use 40A SSRs, even though the elements are about 13A. If I decide to switch elements I'll have to change wires throughout the house so that is a future job. 

I've painted the enclosure black so it does not stand out too much, and I'm planning to add indicator lights on the side so that I can see when the elements are firing, and also turn them off manually for cleaning. I'd like to avoid circumstances where they dry fire or fire during cleaning. I'm going to look for a smaller 12v power supply unit, to make room for two smaller contactors to control elements independently.

"Ol man bought a basic ale kit and shipped it to me for xmas, thought I'd make a post because I have a few questions about brewing in general Hope all I have to say is allowed, new to beer brewing and since I have a busy day and wont be able to spend quality time researching the many questions on my mind. Going to do my best to make them broad and not heavily specific in Hope's for a well thought out list of answers and advice

So this kit is from the company craft a brew, a 1 gallon brown ale starting kit. Havent started it just yet, waiting for xmas which is my next day off. No real questions about the kit itself, 

the questions I have are about what styles of beer work best for aging? I want to age some brews once I get the hang of brewing. And dont want to waste a batch learning the hard way. Especially when it comes to ales. 3-5 litre aging barrels arent terribly expensive online so doesnt hurt to experiment outside of what I've used one for in the past...which was aging London dry gin.....which is not too bad, worth trying if you're not a gin drinker

What is easier to brew and more difficult amongst every style of beer? I just dont want to get a difficult recipe going and discourage myself from brewing 

Adding flavor beyond the grains and sweeteners, for fruits do I mash them up and add it to the mix or cut them, or leave whole, or which ones per types of fruit since a raspberry and apple are completely different

Do you add extra yeast if you want to try and go for a 8-12% abv? 

Honey, maple syrup, agave nectar and other natural non sugar sweeteners, how much would be too much in a recipe that doesnt call for sweet ingredients such as what I listed

Replacing water with tea or coffee, or even sap, how would that work out on a 100% substitution? 

Adding herbs and spices. Is that even a thing?

And most importantly, as far as ales are concerned, how long is too long for fermentation, as well as aging?

I have some unique ideas going on in my head about what would I add or substitute ontop of a generic recipe to create the perfect ale for me. I love all types of ales, some more than others. This gift I hope ends up becoming a regular hobby, I've never brewed beer before, I've only brewed mead and it was simple and pretty good for only doing it once. 

Growlers, kegs/barrels, cans, jars or regular bottles with a capping machine, what is ideal, or cost effective, best for preserving longer than like a couple months? I definitely want to try every logical means of storage, however not sure which I should invest in first. All batches after my 1st from this kit I want to store them and not drink it all like a thirsty drunk lol

Happy holidays everybody",Homebrewing
"Fermenter modding idea I was wondering  if there were any kinds of fermenters which have a hydrometer attachment installed for continuous SG monitoring. When checking on my batches i always hate the waste of pouring off enough to test and it would be nice to just have like a tube connected that i can enclose a hydrometer in or something. I have done some casual searching and haven’t found anything. Also newish to brewing so if it’s not feasible let me know. 

In my head i am just thinking of a tube the length of the fermenter that is bored into the bucket and you can just keep an eye on the SG with a cursory glance by enclosing a hydrometer (or one preinstalled) with a lid that can be taken off to clean and sanitize it all.",Homebrewing

"I think my Brew Jacket's Jacket is wrong My wife got me a Brew Jacket for Xmas.  It showed up on our doorstep with a big old ""BREW JACKET"" label on it, so she relented and gave it to me before Xmas.  I'm planning on trying it out with a brew over Xmas, but I wanted to test drive it before I was working with an actual brew.

&amp;#x200B;

I typically brew in carboys or buckets, and the box for this thing says it's for bucket/'carboy brewing.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps I'm an idiot (the wife would say I am), but the jacket that came with it doesn't seem right to me.  There's the circular zipper end on it that's the bottom, right?  The top end, the end with the drawstring has no opening.  It's a nylon fabric chimney that's about as long as the ""insulated bucket"" part of the jacket.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this how it's supposed to be?  Am I supposed to cut an opening in this?  For the money (even though she got it 50% off), I would have thought it would be more finished.  And I wanted to check before I did anything stupid/contacted the company.

"Building ""high-end"" homebrewery - looking for setup recommendation Hello Everyone,

I've been brewing for a couple of years while upgrading my equipment here and there. At the moment, I use a 10 Gal MLT setup (for 5-6Gal batches), which I'm very comfortable with. I have 2x 7Gal fermentors (one anvil-like stainless, one Fermzilla). As the title suggests, I'm looking to GREATLY improve my brewing and I have a decent budget to spend. I'm looking for additional pros and cons on certain elements I'd like to purchase, and recommendations of pro homebrewers that were in my shoes earlier in their career.

My goal would be to brew bigger batches with precise temperature control. On the cold side, I'm looking to experiment with yeasts comparison and aging comparison. I'm looking to both keg and bottle. I'm not that interested in bottle conditioning; I already own a Tapcooler counter pressure filler and I would prefer to use it. Cleaning wise, I'd like to CIP everthing.

The first piece I'm eyeing is the Grainfather G70. Electric brewing seems A+ here and I believe my hot side will be covered. My question resides more on the cold side of the thing. As the G70 brews &gt;40L batches, I need more fermentors (either 14Gal or 2x 7Gal per batch). 

This is where my hesitation resides.  For my interest; yeasts comparison sounds like a 2x 7 Gal thing and the aging comparison looks like a 1 x 14Gal one then split in two carboys. If I were to use plastic Fermzilla things, well it would be a no-brainer and I'd just buy everything, but I'm looking for more sturdy gear (like SS from ss brewtech or spike?). I can handle a little bit of DIY but I'd rather spend a few more $ than having a highly custom setup.

The ""pretty-sure"" thing are

\- G70

\- Glycol Chiller (around 1/3 hp) 

The ""what should I do"" things are

\- 1x 14 Gal Unitank or,

\- 2x 7 gal Unitank or,

\- 1x 14 Gal Unitank + 2x ss brewbucket (and do the priming via kegs?) then purchase 7 gal unitank later or, 

\- or ... ?

My thought process is stuck and I feel I miss the pros and cons to weigh my decision. Also if you have a totally different approach for the same problem feel free to pitch in.

* 1 lb (8.2%) flaked barley
* 1 lb (8.2%) pale chocolate
* 0.5 lb (4.1%) caramel 120
* 0.25 (2%) Carafa special I
* 0.5 oz Nugget (60) at 13.3% AA (21 IBUs)
* 0.25 oz Nugget (30) at 13.3% AA (8 IBUs)
* 1 oz centennial (5) at 8.2% AA (5 IBUs)
* 0.5 oz amarillo (1) at 8.2% AA (0.6 IBU) (I was mostly using leftover hops for this recipe, and it turned out nicely, but I don't think I got anything from the late amarillo addition)
* WLP004 Irish Ale

&amp;#x200B;

* For the tincture roast 4 oz of cacao nibs at 275F for 15 minutes, put them in a mason jar with just enough vodka to cover them, and let it sit for 2 weeks. Then add one tablespoon of vanilla extract to the tincture right before kegging.

"This is the second time in a row I have been shipped hop packets with holes in them. What would you do? As the title says, this makes twice in a row. And I'm seriously unimpressed. We're talking about the vacuum sealed freeze dried pellets.

Two shipments in a row have arrived with holed packets. And really, I don't think it's good enough. It takes a long time to ship them half way across the country and now it's Christmas, I've got no hope of getting more by the time I want to brew (i.e. NOW).

"Killing yeast to pitch another So I have an idea for a brew where I want to brew to a high gravity (thinking 1.100), pitch champagne yeast, then ferment to about 1.030-1.040, then kill the champagne yeast to stop that fermentation, and pitch Pedio and Brett. I've read that you can kill yeast with potassium sorbate, but I'm curious if the potassium sorbate will make the Brett unable to ferment as well? I've already read that Brett is immune to the ""killer toxin"" of most wine yeasts, so I'm not worried about that.

"Off-Flavor while fermenting in keg... Any idea? Hi!!

I am experimenting with fermenting directly in keg. The 2 first fermentations where done under pressure. The first one was a stout and good. The second one was a dobble Bock and was ... weird. FG was quite higher than expected. I put it under the pressurize fermentation fault. The taste was off. Somehow cidery almost like acetaldehyde. I was like ok it is clearly an incomplete fermentation...

My last try is in the same keg without pressure just a blow off tube. The fermentation went well. FG as expected - a little on the dry side. Now I tested it after 1 week in the fridge. Boom same taste. This off flavor I have difficulty to describe... 

I cannot imagine the stainless steel being an issue. I'm thinking about too much time on the yeast? But I thought autolyze was not an Homebrewer issue..

I brewed a stout (OG 1.071). I actually pitched the yeast (WLP001 starter, following beersmith's calculator) then went away for the weekend, but saw dried yeast on the neck of the carboy which made me think it must've had krausen at some point while I was gone.

I took a gravity reading four days ago when activity really seemed to die down and found it to be at 1.030. I was expecting it to dry out to about 1.020, so I warmed it up to 68F for a day and pitched a packet of US05. I saw some activity the first day but not much after.  Today I took another reading and it's still at 1.030. I'm going to warm it back up soon, but I had to drop it down to mid sixties again because I put another beer in the fermentation chamber.

"post-boil wort cooling with a fan with lid on? For most of the last five years, once my boil was over, I'd get some oven mitts on and lug my near-boiling wort inside and up some stairs to the kitchen that I was hooking my immersion chiller up to.  This past spring, I decided it was a great time to retire that method.  I got lucky never dumping six gallons of boiling liquid all over myself but it is totally something that could happen.  So far, I've just hooked my immersion chiller up to a hose hookup outside.  Now that it's actually cold out, I've turned that faucet off from the inside.  I also wouldn't want to ice up my driveway that bad.

To make a short story long, has anybody that lives in a cold climate had success putting the lid on the pot and just pointing some fans at the pot?  The air I would be blowing at the pot would be significantly colder than any water I've ever used in an immersion chiller.  The downside is I won't be able to gently stir it like I do with my immersion chiller.  I really want the lid on because the fans will likely pick debris up from the garage floor and let it fly into the wort.  I do some pretty vigorous boils so I'm not super worried about DMS for the cooling period unless it drags on for much longer than my immersion chiller would take.

I've tried setting my pot in a snowbank before but it doesn't work nearly as well as you'd think.  The pot melts the snow touching the sides of the pot immediately, leaving an air gap that I'm sure provides some insulation from the rest of the snow.",Homebrewing
"Please criticize my first attempt at making cider/alcohol! Hello everyone,

I have recently tried making cider for the first time and would like some feedback on my recipe/methods/etc. since I'm only mildly satisfied with my first attempt.

The Recipe: - I kept this very simple for my first attempt.

4.5 gallons of Treetop ""3 apple blend"" apple juice.
1 tsp Pectin Enzyme (for clarity)
5 tsp Yeast Nutrient
1 Packet of Lalvin K1-V1116 yeast
No sugar/sweetener added. OG: 1.048
Fermenting: - I let ferment for two weeks until I saw no activity in the carboy. Fermentation took place in a dark room around 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

FG: 1.000-1.002

Kegging/Racking: - I cold crashed for 24 hours for clarity. I then transferred the cider to a Corny Keg and backsweetened with 24oz of Treetop Apple juice concentrate with 1/4 tsp Potassium Meta-Bisulfate and 2.5 tsp of Potassium Sorbate.

I then let sit at cellar temperatures (45 degrees Fahrenheit) and let sit at 16 psi for two weeks. It's okay. My friend described it having a ""vomit taste"" which I can pick up on a tiny bit. It has a bit of acidity that is very prominent at warmer temps, but it's not undrinkable, I'm curious if that's because the K1-V1116 champagne yeast... I'm drinking it at cellar temp and it's not bad, but nothing exciting or ""great"" by any means.

It's a little too sweet for my taste, I regret adding 24oz of juice concentrate instead of the 12oz I originally intended, but I can live with it.

When I try this again I plan on letting it ferment for at least another week, adding some sugar initially to boost the gravity slightly, and maybe using a different yeast (S-04?) and probably adding a different flavor of juice to back sweeten, but I'm not sure yet.

Any advice/feedback based on my first attempt? I'm not upset, but I am slightly disappointed. I was hoping for something a bit more enjoyable. Thank you!",Homebrewing

"The yeast suddenly stopped fermenting. Is something wrong? So, a couple weeks ago, I brewed up a cider, where I pasteurised the apples to extract the juice, and then took my readings, pitched the yeast, yada yada yada. It worked out great 👍 
But a couple days ago, I tried juicing a bunch of oranges and pomegranates I had lying around, but just juiced them and didn’t pasteurise it, but otherwise went through the same process as the cider, with one other exception. This time, the morning after I pitched my yeast, I stirred all the foamy stuff and bits of pulp that rose up and stuck to the walls of the fermenter, back into the mash. All seemed to be going well, with the airlock bubbling away all day and night. Then this morning, after I woke up, I stirred it all up again, cuz the pulp had settled at the bottom, and I wanted to make sure the yeast had all their nutrients and the flavour of the fruit would continue to blend. But after I sealed it back up, it stopped fermenting entirely. No pressure showing at the airlock. Should I not have stirred it? Do the yeast just need their alone time, once they get started? Or did they actually completely finish? I find the latter option a bit hard to believe, since the apple batch was bubbling for about a week, but this one was only 2 nights and a day. I used the same yeast each time, and it’s almost the same quantity of liquid, though a little less sugar in this batch (1080 for the cider, and 1070 for this one). Granted, it’s also a liter or two less liquid, and it’s a turbo yeast, but the difference of 5 days of bubbling seems too big to ignore. I have not yet checked the gravity reading since it stopped, as I want to leave it until morning, just in case, so I will check to see the sugar content tomorrow.
But in the meantime, does anyone have any input/thoughts?

From what I’ve read mosaic and citra are the classic hops pair for this style, with a 2 row backbone. Is there a relatively straightforward hop schedule and grain bill (note: we are doing BIAB) that will produce a respectable result for a first timer?

"Kegged IPA won't carbonate I have an IPA on tap that I kegged 2 weeks ago and it hasn't carbonated at all. I think I've had this issue with the last several IPAs I've kegged. Meanwhile other beers seem to be carbonating just fine. I have a cider on tap that I kegged *after* the IPA and it's well on its way to being fully carbed. 

Here are some details to help with troubleshooting:

* Keezer is kept at 34°F and the regulator is set to 12 psi
* I have verified that the keg does not leak and CO2 is entering the keg (when I pull the PRV a nice blast of 12psi CO2 comes out, and when I pour myself a sample of the IPA I can hear the CO2 entering the keg to replace the beer I poured) 
* This IPA (and my others) is dry hopped in the keg by suspending a mesh bag with pellet hops from the underside of the keg lid. Could this possibly be keeping CO2 from staying in solution? Seems unlikely given the keg is a sealed and pressurized system... but bagged dry hops are a unique and common variable that applies only to the IPAs I keg, and these are the only ones I have carb issues with. 
* No leaks anywhere in my kegging setup and the CO2 tank isn't empty
* Keg was filled pretty full but not so full that the gas dip tube was under the beer level",Homebrewing

I did add 2 ounces of dry hops at high krausen, then let that sit for about a 8 or 9 days.  Cold crashed and then kegged it.    I didn't take a FG reading as I haven't done that for years.  Just lazyness, no excuse.

"Lower ABV than expected Hello all!

Were in the late stages of fermentation on the first beer we've ever brewed. We're doing a pre-made kit using Wyeast 3068.

The kit is a grainfather G30 with graincape and an SS brewtech Brewbucket and a plaato airlock.
We made sure to sanitize everything very properly before airating the wort by splashing it in the Brewbucket from a height we found acceptable. We pitched the yeast with the same temperature as the wort after the counterflow chiller (+-19 degrees c).

Our OG was 1.057 for a recipe that asked for 1.055. Our brewday was a bit odd. We lost about 3L during mashing, making a 19L pre-sparge batch into a 16L one, we sparged with about 4,5-5L according the recipe. Boiling about 65 minutes, adding the Tettnang hops 20 minutes into the boil.

However, after 4 days in the fermenter our gravity is reading 1.027 with almost no activity in the airlock. The sample smells like a weizen, has a hint of banana in there (which is exactly what we aimed for) and looks cloudy, without any trub.

Is it possible we have a lower ABV than expected due to under pitching?",Homebrewing

"Is my hard cider ruined or still okay? About five years ago I made my first batch of hard cider and today I revisited it thinking age may turn what was a rough first attempt in to something a little more palatable. 

Cracked it open and it still has carbonation since, before bottling, I added a pinch of plain sugar.

Unfortunately it still tastes much of the same from what I remember It doesn't taste great but, IIRC, the gravity suggested it was around 11% so maybe that's just the way it's suppose to be but definitely wasn't vinegar. 

That being said, I noticed it's clearer and that there are clumps/a layer of something which is on the bottom. I gave these bottles a nice scrub with the ""pink stuff"" prior to bottling and I took the measures needed to not have it go wild so I suspect it's either yeast which has crashed over the years or maybe even an infection but don't have the know how to know.

My question is whether or not this batch is lost or if it's simply normal for there to be fallout years after bottling. Is there anything I should look for in order to know what it is I am seeing?

I've started brewing my own beer a couple of months back and I have been brewing about 8x 1gal batches since then. All of them were coming out drinkable at least and downright delicious at times. Until now.

I've always changed a few things during the brewing process (new tools, better knowledge about ingredients, new sanitizers etc.).

Now, for the first time I got a batch that is absolutely undrinkable. Here are a few observations:

* The bottles don't really plop when opening (they usually would), but after a short delay, they foam like crazy and start overflowing - I never had problems with (over-)carbonation before and didn't change the amount of table sugar used
* The smell is disgusting. I looked up smells of oxidized beer but I can't really put my finger on whether it matches any of them or not.
* The taste also isn't pleasant, although the smell is far worse.

"2020 hops What experiences have you guys had with 2020 crop-year hops so far? I have a standard single-hop IPA recipe that I like to brew repeatedly whenever I order hops in bulk (I buy 1# bags from YVH as soon as the year's harvest becomes available). Hop-wise the recipe is 0.5oz at 10min, 2.0oz at flameout, 2.5oz dry hop for 2 days, Chico yeast.

2019 Citra, for example, was pretty incredible in my opinion. Very tropical and pungent. Loads of flavor and aroma.

2020 Mosaic, on the other hand, is extremely meh and disappointing. Very little fruity or ""dank"" flavor, just kind of a medium-intensity generic west coast hop taste/aroma. Tastes like a mediocre craft beer from ten years ago.

Next up I'll be giving 2020 Citra a try, I hope it lives up to 2019 instead of being mediocre like this year's Mosaic. After that, 2020 El Dorado.

So I'm curious to see everyone throw out their experiences and see if there are any trends. Granted, there is probably big variety based on which harvest you're getting and how it is stored.

I got both my taps on the door, the tubing all plugged in, so I was ready to go.

I had one keg of beer. I had pressure fermented in the keg, and it held pressure fine, so I knew the keg was good. This was my very first time with kegs and co2, so I was a bit nervous. I had the regulator hooked up to the tank and then to a manifold and then the keg. The valves on The regulator and manifold all closed. I release the co2 from the tank. Regulator gauges go up. spray everything with starsan. Looks good. Open regulator valve. Spray again. Looks good. Open manifold valve to keg. Now there's a loud hissing from the keg. Not feeling good about the sound, but my research told me there would be noise when the keg is carbonating. Spray everything again. Seems okay. Pull some beer from the tap. Comes out fine, but the beer is, of course, kind if flat. Still worried about the hissing, but tell myself I'm just overthinking it. Make sure psi is set where I want, then I close the fridge and walk away.

That evening I go to check on it. No more hissing = good sign? Pull on the tap. Not a drop. regulator gauges at zero. Pull on keg release  valve and there is zero pressure in the keg. Nothing at all. Wherever the leak was, it has to be in the keg, and big enough to empty a 5lb tank in a few hours. Did I not put the disconnect on right?

In taste, I'm looking for something like Valentins Weißbier, maybe Karlskrone's Weissbier (with a bit more orange). Though I never tasted clove or banana in them - which is how M20 is advertised...

"Delayed dry hopping in keg Hi

I might be brewing for an event in the coming year. I don't know how much free time I'll have for brewing, in the weeks and months leading up to said event. Therefore I was thinking about brewing the beers about 6 months in advance, and storing it in kegs. 

I wanted to brew 1 or 2 IPAs, but have read that the hop aroma might fade with time. I have also read about some guys dry hopping directly into the keg, using pellets in a hop bag. 

That got me thinking. 

I could postpone the dry hop until about a week before I need the beers. I would transfer the beer from one keg into another, that then contains the dry hop. I would probably have to do the transfer under pressure, but i don't think that should be at problem. 

Has anyone tried something similar? Or do you guys have any idea what to expect from this?

I'm new to homebrewing, and wanted to try my hand at a hard lemonade.  The first week was going well, and I finally got my bentonite in the mail.  I read that if you added bentonite at the beginning of a fermentation the bubbling action clarified as fermentation progressed.  My yeast slowed down in my 1 gallon batch, but I figured what could be the harm in adding it?  The instructions said to mix it with warm water, but I figured I could just put a little bit in and swirl it around some.  I put 1/4 teaspoon in and instantly regretted my decision.  The second the bentonite his the brew, it began rapidly producing a foam.

"Topaz Pale Ale Hey All,

I'm a strong advocate for using simple recipes for finding your best process and getting the most from your ingredients. And I just recently did  a 4.8% pale ale that utilized only Topaz hops because I wanted to get a better understanding of it!

Here's the recipe:

Grist

9.5lb or 4.3kg (78.3%) Bohemian Pilsner Malt (Weyermann)

1lb or 453g (8.7%) Munich I (Weyermann)

1.5lb or 680g (13%) White Wheat Malt (Proximity)

Mash @ 156degF or #nice degC for 1hr


60 min boil

0.75oz or 21g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) at 30min for 16IBU

4oz or 113g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) at flameout for 40IBU

3oz or 85g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) Dryhop post-fermentation


Yeast

I used Omega Yeast Labs OYL-009 West Coast Ale II, but they don't produce this yeast on a homebrew level anymore. You can use Wyeast 1272 for similar results. I love this yeast for highly-hopped beers because it's clean fermented at low temps (65degF/18degC) or amps up fruity hops with esters at higher (70degF/21degC). I went with the higher end for this beer because of the hop choice.

OG 13.2degP or 1.054sg

FG 4.3degP or 1.017sg

This beer was good. It had a fullness that the hops gave after dry hopping. I've found that a lot of Australian hops like this and Galaxy give a beer a much fuller feeling and flavor. The aroma was smaller I think from the ABV, but it was very tropical with mango, coconut, pineapple while also having a spicy character that reminded me of cinnamon or clove.

Overall, I really liked this hop as it had many flavors going on. However, I think it would be best utilized with another tropical/citrus hop like Citra or Centennial. Several descriptions of Topaz mentioned more lychee flavors at higher gravities, which I obviously didn't mess with. So that's another thing you could play with for this hop, just making this recipe and bumping up the gravity to a 7+%ABV beer.

I'm here for questions and would love comments if you have experience with this hop and how it may have been different.

Happy Brewing!",Homebrewing

1 lb of Honey Malt

.5 lb of lactose

The wheels are turning in my head. Assume target is a 5 or 5.5 gal batch

Can I make a decent creamsicle ale with this, on a backbone of Maris Otter pale malt? A lot of the creamsicle ale recipes I've seen are based on 6 row or 2 row, would the Maris Otter (which I understand is a 2 row derivative), so my guess is it shouldn't be too much of a stretch.

I'm assuming starting with 10-11 lbs of Maris Otter as the base

Is 1lb of honey malt too much? should I cut it to 8oz?

adding some orange peel late in the boil.

Possibly adding some vanilla, either after  few days of fermenting, or at bottling. I've got a bottle of sugar free torani vanilla syrup I grabbed on a whim from my LHBS, and I'm debating if this is worth using here, and if so, how much to try

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for thoughts on percentages. Are there other hops that I have on hand (Mt Hood, Kent Goldings, Newport, Fuggles) that would blend well with this, or should I just double-up on the Pacifica.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I plan on pitching the whole (11g) pack of voss kviek, or just half the package? I've read things about it performing very well when under-pitched at higher temps, but the package recommends .5 to 1g pitch per liter, so my guess is whole pack

"Looking for a primary regulator Hi fellow home brewers, 

I'm looking to purchase a new primary regulator for myself and after doing some research it looks like Taprite and Micro Matic come highly recommended. I was wondering what specific models you would recommend. Im located in Canada if that matters.

It looks like Taprite comes in the Poly bonnet with red adjustment knob and zinc bonnet with screw adjustment.

Micro Matic looks to have the Premium Series (642) and Premium Plus Series (842) with the former having an adjustment knob and latter having a screw (not sure as it has a cap and there is very limited info).

In the end I think I want to have that adjustable knob instead of a screw that requires a screwdriver for ease of adjustment but I'm not a fan of the plastic in the Taprite.

Then a family emergency popped up which is forcing me to be away from home for several weeks.

"Urgent Siphoning Help!! Hey all,

I've done a little digging and can't seem to find an answer to this question. Hopefully this isn't redundant!

I recently started brewing my first batch of beer (Dry malt extract + cascade hops) but I've run into an issue. I fermented a 5 litre batch in a 30 litre fermenter (mistake #1) and I'm trying to siphon it now that the fermentation is complete. Unfortunately, my siphon is this annoying jiggle siphon ([Kegland siphon](https://www.kegland.com.au/plastic-jiggle-auto-siphon-racking-cane-with-vinyl-tube-10mmx14mmx1-4m.html) and I'm just not able to start the suction with it (probably because there's very little beer relative to my fermenter). In trying to get the siphoning started by doing the pump action, I've probably already aerated the shit it out of it and the sediment has definitely been disturbed. I don't have a way of getting a better siphon until mid next-week so I have a couple of options:

1. Pump even more and risk further aerating the beer to get a very slow siphon going. 

2. (My preference)  Close the lid of my fermzilla fermenter, let it sit in the closet for a few more days and then cold crash it again while I procure a better siphon. This will give a chance for the sediment to drop again. I'm just concerned about the aeration that has already happened.

Neither is ideal but since I've already opened my fermenter lid for 20-30 minutes, is it bad to close it and let it keep fermenting? Or is there pressure to bottle ASAP?

Also, given my siphon woes, I'm wary of siphoning into a bucket and then siphoning again into bottles. Are either of these a good idea?

1. Cold crash the beer again and throw in the priming sugar into the fermenter itself, mix it gently and then siphon immediately into bottles.

2. Meticulously split the priming sugar into all my bottles and siphon straight into the bottles.

"First time dry hopping - what to look out for? Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

tomorrow I'll be brewing a Black IPA that I am considering to dry hop. Given that I am still fairly new to homebrewing and haven't done that yet, I would like to get some advice. Say you could talk to yourself when you were first going to dry hop a beer, what would you tell yourself? What would you suggest to someone trying it for the first time? What to look out for?

&amp;#x200B;

Some details about the beer/recipe:

It will be a recreation of Clawhammer Supply's [Black IPA](https://www.clawhammersupply.com/blogs/moonshine-still-blog/how-to-brew-a-black-ipa-homebrew-beer-recipe). So that is

OG = 1.061

FG = 1.008

ABV = 6.96%

Volume = 5.3 gal

Malt:

* Pale Malt - 10lbs, 8.0 oz. (4kg 762.7g)
* Flaked Rye - 12.8 oz. (362.9g)
* Crystal 60 - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Crystal 120 - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Chocolate Wheat - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Carafa III - 6.4 oz. (181.4g)

Hops:

* Columbus - 0.3 oz (8.5g) at 60 minutes
* Centennial - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at 45 minutes
* Centennial - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at 30 minutes
* Cascade - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at 15 minutes
* Cascade - 0.5 (14.17g) oz at 5 minutes

They mention that the beer is lacking hop aroma somewhat. So I was considering to add some (probably 1 oz) Galaxy hops to the hopstand. And then as mentioned before some dry hopping. I still have quite a bit of Citra hops in my storage, so I was planning to use those. I was considering to add some amount (something like 1.5 to 2 oz) after fermentation is mainly done and to leave them in for about 5 days.

Yeast:

* Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II)

"Non distilled whisky approximation?  

Hi All,

I've been kicking around the idea of trying to homebrew something non distilled that would taste similar to whisky but I'm not sure how realistic this is. I found an old thread on a different website where a guy was trying for the same thing with a corn wine that was 80% corn 20% malt and he put oak chips in during secondary fermentation. He said it tasted good but wasn't like whisky at all really.

I'm thinking maybe 100% malt or rye and aged with oak maybe? Obviously the ABV will be a lot lower than whisky but I'm just aiming for flavor ballpark. Has anyone tried for something similar or have ideas other than distilling or adding a ton of still spirits whisky essence?",Homebrewing
"Electric brewing - 5 gal batches on 120/15 circuit. Possible? I'm looking to move from 3 gal batches to 5 gal batches now that I'm kegging. My current setup is a 5 gal BK and a 10 gal cooler MLT paired with a RIMS tube, a 1650w element, and a IPB-16S for temp control. I use my electric glass-top stove to heat my strike and sparge water as well as bring the 4ish gal of wort up to a boil.

I'm thinking of getting a 10 gal kettle from Spike with a tri-clamp added to the back so I can add an element, starting out with a 1650 element running through a 120/15 circuit that I can upgrade once I can afford to buy a house with a basement and can run a 240/30 circuit just for brewing. I'd use the IPB-16s as my controller for the BK as well, and potentially use my electric stove to add some extra heat. Is 1650w going to be enough power to get 6ish gallons up to a boil or am I going to waste my money?

"two water questions for y'all Two quick water questions I hope aren't too dumb that I hope you can help me with. I haven't really spent time with water issues before but am trying to learn more about it as a way to be more detailed with my beer.

1. Does a carbon filter remove brewing minerals like Ca, Mg, Na, SO4, Cl, and bicarbonate, or not? I usually run my water through a filter and am not sure what if anything I'm actually removing doing so.
2. In BeerSmith I took the water profile I got from the tap from my city (Los Angeles, specifically East Los Angeles) and entered it in, but something seems off. Given the mineral profile (expressed by the city as mg/L but that's basically ppm, yes?) the BeerSmith water analysis shows effective hardness as only 28 ppm. However, the city's chart has a hardness (called total hardness) that is substantially higher at around 115 mg/L. Is there a difference between ""total"" hardness and ""effective"" hardness that would account for the discrepancy? One difference is that BeerSmith shows Bicarbonate as HC03 while the city shows Bicarbonate and hardness as CaC03, so something may be different there? 

At some point I may start just buying RO water and building up from it, but would like to at least understand my tap water right now.

"Using an all-in-one all grain brew kettle to prepare powdered malt + grain bag recipe A few years ago I used to brew a lot of Mr Beer 2 gallon batches using the canned malt syrup.  My wife encouraged me to get back into brewing again, and this time I wanted to make larger batches so a couple months ago I bought a Brew Demon catalyst kit with the 6.5 gallon fermenter.  It came with the Oktoberfest recipe.

I needed to buy a new pot to boil the malt in.  While looking for large stockpots, I found out that electric brew kettles exist.  Then I found out about all-in-one's that come with things like a grain basket and immersion chiller.

Since it was Black Friday, I figured why not take the opportunity to get a really nice one.  I got the Anvil 10.5 gallon and it came with the recirc pump free as part of the sale.

So now I have a 10.5 gallon, 220V kettle, with grain basket, immersion chiller, and a recirc pump.  To brew a recipe that comes with 6lbs of what looks like malt milkshake powder and 2 lbs of ""aromatic"" (sic) grain in sock.

Don't get me wrong this is a nice problem to have, but - my boiling setup is a bit overkill for the recipe ingredients I have.  It's unclear which brew kettle features I should *take out* for this run.  Do I leave off the recirculation pump (in case clumps of malt powder might clog it)?  Do I put the crushed grains directly in the grain basket, take out the grain basket to just use the sock, or maybe place the sock in the grain basket?

The instruction manual warns brew-in-a-bag grains might be too fine for the basket, but I'm unclear if this is equivalent to brew in a bag and I'm unclear what constitutes a fine grind.  The grains in the recipe kit seem to be all different sizes from cornmeal size to whole grains.  (Average is about cous cous size.)

Also the perforated disk which you're supposed to put over the grain basket when using the recirculation pump is on back-order, so I haven't gotten that yet; I do have the external pump itself.",Homebrewing

"Can We Please Address This: Mash PH Temp Corrections and All Sorts of Confusion I am a lot of emotions right now.

Is mash PH the most mythical concept in homebrewing that we're all afraid to address? I've been doing a lot of research and get some conflicting answers everywhere I look. I have an Apera Instruments digital PH meter with ATC (automatic temperature control). 

From what I understand, **mash PH is lower at true mash temps (152F) than our collected sample cooled to room temp (65F).** Meaning to truly understand our hot mash PH, we need to correct for temp REGARDLESS if our PH meter has ATC functionality built-in. John Palmer suggests we should subtract 0.35 from our room temp PH reading to get our TRUE mash PH.

So if my room temp mash PH (taken at 65F) is 5.7, we must subtract 0.35 to get our actual mash PH of 5.35. **This is the number we actually want.**

**My process now is:**

1. I take my first mash PH reading after a 10-minute rest after mashing in.
2. I draw off a sample and let it cool to 60-70 degrees F.
3. I take a PH reading and let's say it 5.7.
4. I subtract 0.35 and determine mash PH is actually 5.35.
5. I celebrate and or make any acid adjustments from here if needed.

I'm assuming that ATC only helps us compensate for our room temp reading and it's not actually correcting for a true hot mash reading. If I were to take a direct PH reading in my hot mash with my digital meter I would 1. probably destroy the meter, and 2. get a truly accurate reading. Hooray.

Does this jive with what everyone else agrees on? Would love to argue about this.

I've been using Speidel fermenters for a long time, and I'm quite happy with them. I've modded my 12L and 30L to add a stainless steel thermowells and fitted a cap with a gas post in order to do closed transfers to kegs.

That being said, I've been looking into Ss Brew buckets for three reasons:

1. Stainless seems better and more resistant than plastic.
2. I expect it would hold pressure better than the Speidels, where even 1psi seems to leak depending on how the lid is sealed. 
3. I would like to add a TC port and a butterfly valve to the brew bucket so that I could flush my dry hop additions with CO2 using a diopter or similar. 

Are Brew buckets fine for this purpose?

Does anyone have experience with fitting a Ss brew bucket with a TC port and it holding some pressure?

Thanks!",Homebrewing
First brew question I bought a beginner kit with the Brewferm Belgian wit to brew. It says to wait 6-8 weeks till it's ready after bottling or kegging. I've left it in a closet so room temp and at 6 weeks today I tried a taste today and it tastes watery and flat. The smell also smells like when I first added it to the keg. Do I wait another 2 weeks to see if it improves or have I ruined it in some way?,Homebrewing

"Freezer destined to be a keezer does not have a ""continuous"" inside lining. to silicone or not to silicone? Does anyone have experience with a keezer conversion where the inside bottom lining wraps ""into"" the freezer and leaves gaps at the edges (see [picture](https://imgur.com/a/7mzKT7j)).  I'm pretty sure my previous keezer had a continuous lining.  I thought I read something on the subject, but I really can't find any info about it now.

I'm debating whether or not to silicone the edges.  I can think of arguments both ways.  While the freezer was obviously^Whopefully designed to handle moisture going in and out between the cracks (inevitable when thawing), it probably wasn't designed to accommodate for that moisture being non-frozen most of the time.  I'm also concerned about what happens if there's a beer leak.  There already is at least water and possibly beer in there, as I bought the freezer used and ran it in ""debug mode"" (= styrofoam as a ""lid"" and without a fan) for some months.  If I silicone it, whatever is in there will have no chance of drying out.

I've been drying it for a few weeks now and got a non-trivial amount of water to trickle out of there.  I need to make a final decision one way or another before I put it into use, as I don't want another service break next month.  Any experience-based insights?",Homebrewing

"Done taking gravity readings due to Consistently Low Gravity Since my recent homebrew resurgence this year I’ve brewed around 12-15 times. Pretty much every time for the past few beers the gravity readings (SG and FG) are all about .015-.020 low. I mill my own grain but have tried both a fine milling and course. I have also tried using 100% LHBS milled grain.

I am mashing in 2 11gal coolers from Northern Brewer. I mash in by slowly adding grain and water equally. My mash temps are 150-155 for 60 minutes, vorlauf 2-3 times about a gallon each, then fly sparge with 170deg water over about 10-15 minutes.

The finished beer always ferments down to target or better FG. The beer always tastes great and after a couple pours you can certainly feel a buzz.

I cool the wort before taking readings. I also have 2 hydrometers and they read the same.

Long story short I am done taking gravity readings, all it’s doing is pissing me off and leaving me scratching my head for what I’m doing wrong. I’m always open to suggestions but at this point, have to say fuck it.

"What causes DMS really A recent brew of mine had a strong off flavour that took me a bit to pin down.  It was my first DMS tinged beer.

The brew process wasn’t unusual: a 10L Irish red biab on a convection stove. 1 hour mash at 68C, 3:1 water to grain. Half arsed batch sparse because I actually had a touch too much grain and didn’t want to overshoot gravity. Hot liquor added up to the 10L and boiled for 1 hour. I chilled by putting the pot in a cold water filled sink, and running cold water in a silicone hose heat exchanger submerged in the wort, going from between 90 and 100 C to less that 30C in about half an hour.

Now, everyone will readily say the 2 causes of DMS flavour is the grain bill, chilling too slow and allowing more DMS to form after off-gassing it in the boil.

This is my first DMS experience, and my best chill. I usually chill slower by just sitting the pot in the sink alone, and at least twice have just dumped boiling wort into the ferment keg and sealed it, hosing the outside just until it’s safe to transport and just pitching the next day. I’ve also heard of plenty of people never having issue with no-chill.

So what gives? Reading up on DMS seems pretty scientifically backed, but there is plenty of empirical evidence against the supposed causes.

"Mad Scientist or Lazy Brewer, Same Outcome TL/DR: I fermented an IPA from 1.070 SG to 1.007 SG in four days and am drinking on day six. 

Last Wednesday I brewed an IPA and today (Tuesday), I’m drinking it. I have been playing around with recipes for a strawberry milkshake IPA for a few months now. After mashing my grain (missed the target gravity, but I’m still learning a new system) I realized that I didn’t have the strawberries and decided to improvise. Long story short, I threw some mango purée in my fermenter before transferring the wort over (I know you’re “supposed” to add the fruit at the tail end of fermentation) and transferred the wort at about 100F. Again playing the lazy brewer, I used the yeast I had on hand which was S-05 and pitched it hot, while the wort was transferring. I stored my fermenter in a bathtub that I know remains about 68F all day and heard nothing from the airlock after two days. On the third, I pitched another packet of S-05 thinking I had killed the first bunch. That was a waste because I took the gravity reading the next day after still hearing no activity from the airlock and I was below my predicted FG. Guess that lid doesn’t seal fully. Cold crashed yesterday, kegged last night and poured the first pint tonight. This is why I enjoy brewing, the experimentation and pushing the limits. 

Recipe for those interested (5G batch):

9 lb golden promise
2 lb oat malt
2 lb wheat malt
1 lb honey malt
0.5 lb cara dextrin (leftover so I just tossed it in)
1 oz Columbus (60 minutes)
1 oz Centennial (20 min whirlpool at 150F)
2 oz Hull Melon (20 minute whirlpool at 150F)
1 oz Hull Melon (24 hour dry hop)
32 oz Mango purée 
1 pkg SafAle S-05

- I can go from brew day to brew in hand in six days
- Not everything that is held as true in the brew community is actual Truth, it’s just the way it has been done thus far
- Yeast is hearty and will tend to surprise you
- Don’t always trust the airlock, measure gravity when in doubt",Homebrewing

* 3.25 lbs Munich 20L Malt

"Next step guidance Hello all,

I have made 4 of the five gallon Northern Brewer batches.  Three were straight forward, the fourth needed a secondary fermenter.  I have two more batches to make, because I need practice drinking!  After the first batch I decided my stove didn't have enough ass to heat efficiently, and an ice bath in my sink was equally inefficient.  I've upgraded to a stand alone propane burner, and I have an immersion chiller that I couple with the ice bath.

I'm now soliciting you all for ideas to perfect my craft, my end results, or recommendations on the next step to delve deeper into home brewing.

I'm considering getting an air stone and medical grade O2 instead of sloshing around the fermenting bucket.  I'm also considering getting a glass beaker, shake plate to prepare yeast in advance.  So if I go this route specifically, will these measures improve clarity?  In my novice mind, they would only speed up the fermentation process.  I'd greatly appreciate that, but if the recipe calls for two weeks in the fermenter bucket, how will I know when I can bottle?  Am I risking ruining the batch if I bottle earlier than the instructed two weeks?  Am I risking ruining the batch if I speed up fermentation, then leave it for two weeks?

Next, the Kolsch I prepared called for two additional weeks in a secondary fermenter.  When I moved the five gallon batch from the plastic primary fermenter to the glass carboy there was a good amount of air (maybe five inches) at the top.  How bad is this for oxidizing, creating off flavors?  Any suggestions to overcome this issue?

Any specific or general advice or words of wisdom is greatly appreciated.

In case you need to know I don't have any crazy equipment on hand:
1 Edelmetall propane burner
2 plastic five gallon fermenter buckets
2 plastic five gallon bottling buckets
2 glass five gallon carboys
thermometer
manual capper
racking canes

"Heads up to Brewfather users using no sparge equipment profiles A couple days ago I opened a recipe I was working on the previous day, and I noticed the calculated mash water volume had dropped by ~1/3 of a gallon.  At first I thought I was just misremembering, but I had also filled it out in a Bru'n Water spreadsheet.  I went back through old recipes and checked against my logs, and most had changed.

Some digging around in the [changelog](https://docs.brewfather.app/changelog#2-5-0-09-12-2020) and under Fixed I found:

&gt; Now using cold boil volume rater than hot (including expansion) when calculating water for ""No Sparge"" water calculation method, this will reduce the total water calculated by 4%, you might want to increase the grain absorption rate to compensate

I did the math by hand and confirmed that it was indeed doing that.  Further digging around, I found [this post](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/brewfather-water-needed-for-batch.686474/#post-9017770) with more info, and with a response by Brewfather's creator.

So, if your current no sparge equipment profile has been tuned so your pre-boil volume is correct, be advised that you may need to adjust it.

As a side note, I was a bit confused because the incorrect calculations had seemed to be working for me.  I had imported all my recipes from Beersmith, and the water volumes all lined up, so I never really looked further.  But, looking again, I notice that the default grain absorption in Brewfather (.383 qt./lb.) is different than the default in Beersmith (.96 fl.oz./oz., or .48 qt./lb.), and the latter is closer to what I observe.  It just so happens that the different grain absorption plus the off-by-4% error almost exactly canceled each other out.",Homebrewing

"Life with Kveik Hi everyone. A year now I have been brewing with kveik and it's hard to look back. In this post I just wanted to share with you my cold side schedule for a typical brew with dry hopping.

- Pitch Yeast
- See first bubbles 30min after pitching (this depends on various factors but wont be higher than 2-3 hours) 
- Reach FG after 20-24 hours (higher OG takes a bit longer)
- Dry hop 48 hours after pitching
- Bottle on day 5-6
- Conditioning... (To my experience this takes 2-3 weeks and its the only thing that it is common to other yeasts)

I guess you I could bottle even sooner especially if not dry hopping but since I usually brew on weekends I bottle on the next weekend. But even with this schedule is a week shorter than my typical schedule with a standard yeast. 

Keep in mind that this schedule is typical for Voss, I have found that other Kveiks are also fast but may take few more Hours to reach FG.

Kveik definitely was a game changer for me as I am able to brew more often, experiment more, brew small batches. I used to have 2-3 different beers max in my cellar and with my latest brew I count 9 different beers.

I am not saying everyone should move to kveik, there are definitely more than few beers that cant be brewed with Kveik, but I strongly encourage every homebrewer just to give it a try.

"Bootleg Biology NEEPAH Blend and Classic New England (BETA) Comparison With Bootleg Biology back in stock and releasing more strains today, I thought I would share some quick feedback. Last release, I ordered a pack of their NEEPAH Blend and Classic New England. I didn't intend on doing any direct comparisons, but I've used these strains on my last two brews with the same grain bill and hopping amounts/schedule, so this became an opportunity for a comparison of attenuation and appearance.

5.5 gal batches. Grists were 72% pale malt, 21% wheat malt, and 7% flaked oats. 5 oz. hops on the hot side, 5 oz. on the cold side with two additions: 1st at high krausen and a 2nd for 24 hours at 36F. Fermented at 64-66F, then bumped to 72F.

The NEEPAH Blend beer dropped from 1.064 to 1.014 (78% apparent attenuation) and the Classic New England Beer dropped from 1.064 to 1.010 (84% apparent attenuation). Both beers had a haze that was typical to other strains I've used for NE styles, but the NEEPAH Blend seems to be a bit brighter around the edges. The NEEPAH beer was brewed two weeks before the Classic New England, so this could be a factor, as it's had two weeks longer in the keezer, but the color differences were minimal. The main thing that stood out here was the difference in attenuation, especially the high attenuation of the Classic strain.

"Caramel in American IPA's Right, so I am trying to perfect my American IPA recipe. 

For my grain bill, I am currently using about 80 % pilsner malt and 20 % pale ale malt such as just a regular one or Golden Promise / Maris Otter variant. The beer is approx. 6 % ABV.

I recently purchased a copy of Brew Your Own's IPA style guide and was surprised to notice **every** American IPA recipe has a considerable amount of *caramel malt* in it. For my recipe, I do not wish for any more sweet or caramel flavors in order to get the beer as drinkable as possible - using something like the chico strain and American hops give the impression of sweet anyways. I mash at 65 degrees C (about 150 Fahrenheit) for a decent degree of fermentability and ferment on the lower end of the yeast's recommended temperature range in order to discourage ester production.

In the end, my beer turns out about as sweet as commercial examples go.

Among others, I believe the guys at Genus Brewing agree with me that caramel malts are best left in the bin when brewing an American IPA. I find the contradiction with Brew Your Own and several pro craft brewers interesting.

I am confused as of the purpose of caramel malt in the American IPA style and hence am reaching out to you; please give your opinions concerning the use of caramel malt in American IPA's; I am either looking to strengthen my views on forgetting caramel malts with the style OR someone to put me on the right track and turn my head towards putting 10  % of caramel 60 in my kettle.

"Odd gravity readings... During a ""large"" batch Farm house Saison of about 6 gallons, I took three hydrometer readings labeled ""Pre-boil"", ""Post-boil"", and ""OG"" (to show gravity when I pitched the yeast). What was odd about the readings was that the earlier gravity was higher than the latter. I was under the impression that the gravity would at least increase slightly Post-boil. The Pre-boil gravity showed 1.054 at 60\*F at the meniscus of the hydrometer, and 1.052 at the same temp for the Post and OG. My Pre-boil volume was at 6.5 gallons boiled down to 6 gallons.

And I have been trying to get them to order more, they can't get any for over a year now (covid) :( and a lid alone for this bucket is $30 shipped. :(. My LHBS has the same ones for $40 (bucket and lid, but no lid by itself)., but they are closed due to lockdowns anyway! Buddy is old and grumpy. He's cool and I get his position. 

So what's a fella to do? I bought three small HDPE lids from princess auto(harbour freight) for $2, cut the centers out on my bandsaw. Cut out the cracks. And heat gunned the new plastic on. 

I was going to tig weld in a filler plastic with a soldering iron if I needed to. But this came out amazing!!!

I can't use my carboys or 5g buckets Because. Ahh. Ehhheemmm.... They are full of ciders, orange wine and peach wine. LOL. And the wort I get comes in a 6g bag.

"SMaSH IPA tastes 'astringent' - can it be saved? I brewed my first all grain batch about 6 weeks ago. It went into a keg with a co2 system. I couldn't bottle or keg it on time, so I cold crashed it for about 3 days. After four days in the pressurized keg I took a taste test. After researching off flavors of beer, the best comparison is, it tastes 'astringent'. The advice I found was to let it sit for a few weeks and taste it again. 

If time will fix this, should I keep it refrigerated, or let it age in my 55°F garage?

Should I keep the co2 system connected or disconnect it? If I disconnect, what pressure should I put it at before I do?

"Any flaw in process making my beer turn out the same? Sorry if this is too long.  I don't brew very often but when I do they turn out same. Slightly unpleasant but drinkable. My oktoberfest, brown ale, porter, Vienna lager, all tasted the same. My blonde ale, pale ale, tasted similar to the darker styles but masked by more hops. My neipa was okay but oxidised quickly. The only really good one I made was a Helles. From extract to all grain I've had this problem, and before and after controlling my temp.

Heres my process for a 2.5 gallon to 3 gallon batch

1. Heat up water to strike temp. Adjust water to add more calcium to my local water.  Pour in grains and stir.

2. Mash usually an hour at the temp in 

3. Batch sparge with 170 degree water. Drain roughly 4.25 gallons into kettle

4. Boil 60 min on stove on high. (Am I burning it? If I change it less than high it doesn't look like it's boiling though). Add bittering hops at beginning and later hops around 15 min or less depending on recipe of course.

5. Previously I'd chill using an ice bath, but more recently I'd use a  wort chiller (put in during boil to sanitize) with recirculating ice water in the sink. Stir occasionally to speed up chilling.

6.transfer to 3 gallon carboy. Aerate by splashing and shaking. (I got an aquarium pump but only used it once).

7. Since its &lt; 3 gal I think I can get away with 1 packet dry yeast, maybe 1 liquid yeast. I usually check a pitch rate calc to be sure and use 2 liquid if it says so. I've used American Ale, American Ale II, us-05, an English strain but not sure which, Scottish Ale, 34/70

8. Ferment 2-3 weeks in mid 60s with probe in thermowell. Lower if it's a lager. 

9. Used to bottle: transfer to bucket. Boil sugar in cup of water add an stir in as bucket is filling. Fill sanitized bottle then a friend caps it immediately. Kegging I sanitize 2.5 gallon keg. Use CO2 to pump sanitizer out, fill, purge headspace, burst carb.",Homebrewing

"My oxygen-free fermenter/bottling bucket I just want to share an alternative to fermenting in kegs. I don’t have fridge space for cronies in my apartment and still wanted some of the advantages of fermenting in kegs. I use 5 gallon buckets for 3-4 gallon batches. For my bucket lids, I’ve added a thermowell, ball lock gas post and an 1.25” hole. Overall I think most of the advantages  of corny fermenter, such as positive pressure dry hopping and close transfer, can be had with buckets. Also, I top crop whenever the yeast allows it and fermenting in bucket makes that super easy.

Fermenting: heating pads are used with probe in the thermowell. I use 3 piece airlock with #7 stopper in the accessory hole. For cooling, a stainless loop can be easily added.

Dry hopping: Can be done easily through the accessory hole. I apply positive pressure and flush with CO2 from the ball lock post if I’m dry hopping after fermentation has slowed down.

Cold crashing: I switch to a solid bung and apply light pressure to the bucket with co2 before throwing the entire bucket in kitchen fridge.

Priming: After making sure the beer has completely chilled. This should take around 24 hours. I add priming solution through accessory hole/ball lock post depending on how lazy I feel. I then agitate the bucket to distribute the solution. I’ve done experiments with my typical priming solution (1g sugar: 2g water) and found that diffusion alone cannot provide sufficient mixing even after many hours. 

Bottling: Use bottling wand on the tap with low CO2 pressure applied through the ball lock.

"Temp Controlled Induction Brutus 20  [https://imgur.com/sBI9V2B](https://imgur.com/sBI9V2B)

I really enjoy this brew method.  The guys at Alenuts is where I first ran into it.  They have a real nice write-up (I'm assuming they dreamt up the method):

[http://alenuts.com/Alenuts/brutus20.html](http://alenuts.com/Alenuts/brutus20.html)

It's a two pot, two heat source, cross recirculation set-up.  The method was an effort to simplify from a 3 pot setup, provide clear wort into the BK, and not have the pH issues of fly sparging.  

My setup has a mashtun is on an 1800W induction cooker run by an external temperature controller.  The BK is on a 3500W induction cooker.  Two pumps required, or you can get by with one pump but you need a two tier brewstand so that the second pot can gravity feed back to the first. 

I used this brew method years ago with a RIMs tube and an induction cooker, until the RIMS tube controller died.  Then I just went full volume BIAB on the 3500W induction cooker.  I've always been a fan of induction.  No heating element touching my wart.  No risk of scorching.  Very simple cleanup.  

A while ago, I learned of Adcraft making true manual control induction cooktops that could be actuated from an external controller.  It's the one on the left in my pic.  It's 1800W 110V. They also have a  3000W 208V version.  I'm running my 1800W version with an Anvil temp controller ($25):

[https://www.anvilbrewing.com/-p/anv-temp-controller.htm](https://www.anvilbrewing.com/-p/anv-temp-controller.htm)

Super simple setup.  

I brew 4 gallon batches so I'm only using two of the $25 5-gallon stainless pots, which are induction capable (obviously).   

Pumps are the tan solar pumps.  They throttle flow rate real nice with just the valves on the pot.  

Basic brew process is:

1. Set both pots up to self-recirculate and heat MT to strike temp and BK to mash out temp (oddly enough, the onboard temp controller of the 3500W cooker will heat to around 167F when set to 150F).
2. Mash for 45 minutes while recirculating and the Adcraft maintains mash temp with +/-1F.  I mash in a bag and use a fine crush to speed conversion and you'll never have a stuck mash with a bag.
3. Start to cross recirculate at just a trickle, set temp controller to mash out temp and let it go until both pots reach temperature equilibrium at mash out temp.  This takes 15-20 minutes.
4. Shut-off BK pump and watch as pump from the MT slowly fills the BK with clear beer.  It's a beautiful sight.  The pic is of a brown porter that I just ran this morning.  

I'll get some pics up of the inside of the pots.  Thermowells and drain ports are as low in the pot as I could get them.  The MT has as domed false bottom with center pickup.  The BK has a brewhardware recirc port for whirlpool at cooling.  

What I love about it is (1) the simplicity of induction, (2) the beauty of that crystal clear wort trickling into the BK.  The fact that the mash temp is controller by two off the shelf products is icing on the cake.",Homebrewing

All setups I've seen/read about have a PID controller and heat stick to heat wort during recirculation, but what if I tried something else?

"Newbie Questions Yesterday I completed my 3rd all-grain brew and my first 5 gallon batch with new equipment. I had some problems and I would appreciate some feedback for next time. Here were my steps:

1) Mash temp was 148F, which I hit, but after 20 min it went down to 146F so I added hot water. Then after 20 more min it went down to 146F again and I added hot water. I ended up adding about 3qts additional water in total. Is this correct or should I have just let it be even if it went down below 146?

2) I couldn't get temp up to 168F for Mashout. I added almost 3 gallons of near boiling water and only reached 165F. Is it bad that I didn't hit 168F? Do I really need to add 4gallons to Mashout? I ended up with 9gallons in the mash tun before sparging. This seems like alot. 

3) I recirculated for 15 minutes. The wort was better but still not completely free of stuff. SHould I have kept going? Is there diminishing returns after a certain point?

4) This was my first time fly sparging. I think it went ok. It took about 30 min to fill the brewpot to 6.25g. However, from what I have read online, when regulating the rate, I should keep the level of the water about an inch above the grainbed. I couldn't even see the grainbed, which makes me think I had too much water from trying to mashout. 

5) After I was finished sparging there was still 7 gallons still left in the mash tun. Is this normal or should most of it been drained into the brewpot?

6) My biggest issue was the boil. With 6gallons, I could only reach 208F, which held steady. It was boiling but it was not vigorous. I boiled off about 0.55g in one hour. 

7) During chilling, I had to stop at 140F and add glucoamylase. I stopped right at 140, but then it continued to cool down to about 125 almost immediately. When I added the packet, it all kind of clumped up. I stirred in the best I could. 

8) I usually just dump in a packet of dry yeast. This time I rehydrated first in some boiled and cooled water. The consistency was kind of gummy and strange.

9) The recipe shows an OG of 1.050. I hit 1.039. What does this mean? Do I still use the target FG of 1.000 or do I adjust?

10) And one other thing... I opened my beer from my second brew yesterday, and like my first batch, it is flat. No bite to it and and no head when poured into a glass. What is causing this?!

"Brewing a SMaSH APA right now Hi, so I am mashing right now, don't know what to do in the meantime so I thought I would share what I am doing.

I am making an lazy kid of beer today where I will use my local tap water which is a lot harder than it should be for light beers. I have usually adjusted my water profile, but today I want to check out how it will taste if I just use normal water. 

So I am making 10 l (sorry to all the imperials out there but we roll with metrics units around here) of an American Pale Ale.

I am doing an BIAB with all the water in the brew kettle (17 l)

Fermentables:

2,6 Kg Maris Otter

Hops:

10 g Mandarina Bavaria (8,2%) @ 60 min
15 g Mandarina Bavaria @ 10 min
20 g Mandarina Bavaria hopstand 10 min
30 g Mandarina Bavaria dry hop for 3-4 days (I will add the hops at yeast pitch since well why not) 

Yeast:

1 pkg Lallemand Voss Kveik dry yeast 

Water profile:
Local tap water, which is way to hard...

"5 gal brewers with stainless fermenters - worth it? I currently brew 3 gal batches and use a combination of 3 gallon plastic Fermonsters with [this](https://ballandkeg.com/temperature-control-loop.php) and a cooler with ice water as my temp control solution. I'm pricing out what I'd need for 5 gallon batches (an electric boil kettle is going to be fucking expensive and I can't use propane in my current place. God damnit.) and obviously stainless doesn't come cheap. Right now I'm looking at either an SS Brewtech Brew Bucket, Anvil Bucket, or Spike Flex all with their unique temp control coils, or just buying a 7 gallon Fermonster and using the chill coils + inkbirds I already have. Obviously the Fermonster is going to be a shit ton cheaper than any of the stainless solutions

Is stainless worth anything more than just looking beautiful? Those expensive fermenters worth the money? Should I be looking at plastic conicals or are those just a novelty? I don't pressure ferment, but I do close transfers to kegs and haven't had any issues with my fermonster with over pressurizing, and I'd like to be able to purge my fermenters after dry hopping and switching from blowoff to airlock.

"[Update] Batch Rescured [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/k51des/rescue_a_sour_batch/)

TL;DR of OP - batch had a sour taste. Wanted advice around whether it was infection, whether to throw it out.

Thanks to advice from u/Neuroplasm that the taste could be indicative or a fermenting problem, I checked my notes and found that I fermented it way too cold. Pulled the keg out of the kegerator for a few days, used the purge valve to make sure it was actually fermenting. I assumed at first it was just the CO2 separating from the liquid as it warmed up. But after a few days, those purges had less and less of the sour smell, and eventually stopped altogether.

Popped it back in the kegerator, re-carbonated, and the batch is rescued. It is by no means one of my best beers, but it's (very) drinkable and will keep me going until the two batches I've got brewing at the moment are ready for Christmas.

So I guess the moral of the story is that the old advice of don't be afraid to dump a bad batch is still true, but also don't be too quick to give up on one that can be potentially saved.",Homebrewing

"How does my ""Will it Beer?"" inspired recipe sound? So I recently saw the ""Will it Beer?"" breakfast beer post here, and have since watched the entire series. Loved it. Really opened my mind to some of the crazy possibilities brewing has to offer. And I thought, I'm going to try my own weird ingredient addition. I was drinking Crane Brewing's Apple Spice Gose at the time and thought, why not try apple pie!

I discussed it with a friend and she recommended a stout due to some of the dairy flavors that will be present in the crust. I'm not the hugest fan out stouts, but I drink them occasionally. 5 gallons of stout would take me years to get through. So I'm going to stick with sour and hope it works out. But I was browsing recipes and two apple pies stuck out to me: a caramel apple pie and a bourbon apple pie. So I decided to make a beer joining those styles. Here's the plan:

70% pilsner / 20% white wheat / 10% caramel malt

Caramel malt should be enough to affect the color and give a caramel taste without being overpowering. But I'm going to mash apple pie in with the beer for those apple and cinnamon flavors. I'm adjusting the recipe to include a graham cracker crust so there's less dairy involved. Apple pie recipe calls for both brown and white sugar, so I aimed for a lower OG from grains to account for the probably dramatic increase I'll see from the apple pie. Hoping it's mostly fermentable so I'm not left with an overpoweringly sweet beer.

Will kettle sour with mango GoodBelly drink. No hops. I'm going to use OYL Kveik to ferment since I love kveik yeasts and I think with all the added flavors, I'm not going to get much of a yeast profile anyway.

Then after fermentation stabilizes, I'm going to add 1oz of oak cubes soaked in Jack Daniels (I know not technically bourbon, sue me).

At the end of the day, if it sucks, I'll have had fun and there's always RDWHAHB.

"Question about yeast attenuation and temp control So since I moved my brewing in to the mud room I have intentionally restricted myself to brewing lagers in the winter and ales in the summer to help with temp control for the yeast.

Well this year due to covid scheduling and struggles coupled with limited Brew supply access etc I didn't get around to brewing my darker beers until November. Long story short, I have an imperial pumpkin porter using 1098 british ale yeast that I pitched at 70* but has pretty much spent the past 3 weeks 60*. Currently my attenuation is still pretty low and I'm no where near the gravity I'm expecting to hit yet. 

What are your thoughts? I have one of those heated sleeves I can put around my fermenter to slowly raise it. (Which I know I should have done to begin with..)
Would slowly raising the temp be an ok thing to do this late in the process or should I just wait it out for a few more weeks? The yeast does not appear to be stuck as my gravity seems to be going up one point every week or so but at this rate it could take a few months. I was hoping to have it ready for the Christmas holidays. 

I've only done it this way once before in the first year I started brewing. I made an ale that stayed down in my basement for 3 months while I went on a long work trip, came back, bottled it and it was great.

I brew a lot of German styles, and I [use Sauergut to adjust the pH of the mash and at the end of the boil](https://www.themodernbrewhouse.com/a-sauergut-reactor/). Here's a process I've honed over the years for making small batches of it with little fuss.

1.	Make a full batch of wort using your usual techniques. We’ll split up this batch for making small batches of Sauergut. If you’re a low-oxygen brewer, I don’t recommend using sulfites for this batch—there won’t be an oxygenation step later to use up any of the excess. Once you hit mash-out, acidify down to pH 4.0-4.3 to avoid undesirable microbes. No need to boil. Drain into pouches (1.5 L each, in my case), squeeze all the air out, and freeze.
2.	A week before brewing a beer in which you want to use ‘Gut, pull a pouch out of the freezer to thaw.
3.	One week to one day before dough-in, add Pilsner malt to the pouch (30 g, in my case) to inoculate with Lactobacillus. Squeeze all the air out of the pouch, and cap. Sous-vide at 118.5ºF until you need the ‘Gut. Acidity should be around 1.8-2.0%. I used to let these sour for just 24 hours, but I’ve found I more consistently get the desired acidity level the longer they go.
4.	Add ‘Gut as needed at dough-in and end of boil.

I use [these pouches](https://www.etsy.com/listing/646515773/pack-of-50-top-corner-screw-cap-plastic). Careful: this seller shorted me ten pouches on my order. They eventually corrected the mistake by refunding the cost of the missing ones, but it was a bit of a hassle as I had to send them photos of what I’d received, etc. Still, the pouches are of high quality and seem to handle the freezing temperatures and the heat well.",Homebrewing

I’d like to give him a subscription box for Christmas, one that comes with all/most of the ingredients needed to brew. I see a few online, but have no idea which (if any) are any good. Got any suggestions? I’m not fussed with price, I just want something fun for him to experiment with.",Homebrewing
"Saving undercarbonated beer I've been successfully carbonating all my brews using sugar and priming calculators (I bottle all brews) but recently got some carbonation drops in anticipation of brewing a NEIPA to reduce oxidation. 

They arrived before I bottled the ESB I had brewed so decided to practice using them and bottling straight from the primary fermenter. They were the mangrove jack drops and instructions were for one per 375ml bottle or two for 750ml (think they're Antipodean and those are the standard sizes there). I bottle in 500ml and so after a quick search read one should still be fine, especially as I was bottling a style usually served from cask.

Anyway, fast forward to two weeks of bottle conditioning and there is fuck all carbonation. I presume it's not going to improve from this point so I was wondering are there any negatives (beyond potential oxidation) to opening the bottles, adding another drop and recapping? I'm not too worried about the oxidation, I'm just not excited to have 30+ bottles of flat beer.

At least I know to use 2 per bottle for my NEIPA now. If it helps at all, it's the first time I've used anything but US-05, instead using S-04. But it's a low ABV beer so I can't see why there wouldn't be adequate yeast to feast on the sugar.",Homebrewing

"Anyone brew with wild grains/ingredients? One thing that led me to brewing was the idea of using and preserving things that my partner and I grow in our garden, or forage from the wild. Of course, I fell down the homebrewing rabbit hole and at this point 99% of my ingredients come from the LHBS. But I am definitely interested in using homegrown and foraged ingredients more, at least once the long cold Alaskan winter is over up here. In fact, I have this fantasy about eventually being able to make FREE beer, so I'm always looking for new things I can harvest instead of buying. 

**Does anyone have any favorite ingredients, that you grow yourself or like to forage? How do you go about including them in your home brew recipes?**

I've had really good luck with pureeing our wild and cultivated berries. My first couple of batches of homebrew were made for this purpose -- too many berries to freeze, can, etc. before they go bad! -- and I got started homebrewing by making easy cheesy DME batches and mixing the fruit into the primary. It made kind of a hybrid beer-wine. My partner definitely loved it! And adding puree to the primary is, I discovered, the trick to getting a fun color in your beer. The crowberry wheat I made this fall was dark purple! I know a lot of people really struggle to impart a fruit color in their beer, but that seems to be the ticket. 

At one point I had this fantasy of using wild grains. Wild rye and foxtail barley are prolific here and I started foraging them, but man, it seems like a ton of work to get a usable quantity -- especially since the wild varieties don't seem to have the big, plump grains that the domesticated species do. 

I've also been experimenting with malting local-grown barley, but in Alaska few (if any) farmers are growing malting two-row and it has been a painstaking (and ongoing) process to get the local six-row to germinate and modify evenly. Thus, I'm thinking of trying sow a legitimate small farm plot of grains this spring -- malting varieties of 2-row and 6-row, plus wheat, oats, triticale, and buckwheat -- along with several hops bines. 

Finally, what about herbs, adjuncts, and alternative ingredients? I know spruce tips have been a historical brewing ingredient -- my local LHBS even sells them -- so this spring I hope to find some spruce trees that haven't been killed by beetles, and use them. Last fall, I picked the nasturtium flowers and young leaves from our garden before the frost, and dehydrated them, but now I am not sure what I want to do with them. Also, our property has a ton of birch trees on it and I would really like to tap a few for birch syrup. Does anyone else like to brew with these types of ingredients? Any successes, failures, ideas?",Homebrewing

"Lionshead Lager – A Smoked Red Lager Made with Home-Smoked Malt [https://imgur.com/M30jF7m](https://imgur.com/M30jF7m)

Full blog post and recipe here: [https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2020/12/11/lionshead-lager-smoked-red-x/](https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2020/12/11/lionshead-lager-smoked-red-x/)

So, the story behind this one is pretty simple:

1. I'm a homebrewer.
2. We won a Traeger.
3. Yes, I love BBQ, but what I REALLY want to do is make a smoked beer.

This is the result: a malty, moderately smoky lager made with 50% home-smoked Red X malt. It went far better than I expected, especially given I don't particularly love smoked beer. If you have or have access to a smoker, I highly recommend trying it!

**Beer recipe (4 gal):**

* 3.5# Best Malz Red X (cherrywood-smoked)
* 2.5# Best Malz Red X (unsmoked)
* 1# Best Malz Pilsen
* 15g Loral (10.5% AA) @ 60min
* 15g Loral @ 5min
* 1.5L starter of Saflager W-34/70
* Procedure: Mash at 152 for 75min, boil 60 min, chill to 50F, pitch yeast, ferment until nearly finished and then d-rest at 60F for a couple days. Crash gradually to 34F and lager for 4-6 weeks before serving.

**Smoking the malt:**

1. Wet the grain, using about a half cup of water per pound of malt.
2. Set your smoker to its lowest temp setting and get a good smoke going.
3. Spread the moistened malt on some baking sheets and put them directly on the smoker grate. (Fine-mesh chicken wire would work better here, I just didn't have any.)
4. Fill a spray bottle with more water and mist the malt every 20 minutes, turning it to ensure coverage.
5. Smoke for a total of 4 hours, or until grain tastes appropriately smoky.
6. Once grain is tasting good, transfer cookie sheets to an oven set to the lowest temp (170F) and dry to near original moisture content.
7. Set smoked grain in a paper bag to off-gas for a few days before use.

**Note:** This was also the first beer I made with a CBDS floating dip tube and a spunding valve, which let me ferment and serve in the same keg. It worked phenomenally well, and I think it was a big contributor to this being one of the best beers I've made to date.",Homebrewing

"Howto: converting shanks with hardcoded barbs to Duotight compatible tl;dr cut most of the barb off, then drill with a counterbore bit for cleanup (the second step wasn't obvious at least to me)

pictures: https://imgur.com/a/E7jNtLP

I decided I want to build my new keezer entirely with quick disconnect tubing on the liquid side.  I bought two Duotight/Intertap shanks for testing, but they turned out to be rubbish, since they fit only Intertaps (not Perlicks) and the pour is ridiculously crappy for high-carb beers, as in ""enjoy your glass of foam""-crappy.  I cut the barb off of one of my old shanks with an angle grinder for testing, and spent ages cleaning the burrs with a dremel.  It poured a high-carb high-wheat saison like a dream, so I decided to convert the rest of my shanks.  After a lot of cleanup with the dremel, I still wasn't happy with the lips.  The rough cut had worked in the prototype, but I was worried it would accumulate gunk in long-term service, plus it's unlikely to improve the pour.

I was planning to manually sand/file the lip off -- talk about a labor of hate -- but after weeks of putting off it occurred to me that I could drill the hole clean.  I bolted the shank to a block of wood with two standard shank bolts to hold the shank steady, the bottom side bolt recessed into the block.  The hole in my drill press table is just big enough to hold the shank with some cushioning paper wrapped around, so I didn't need a more complex holding device.  I drilled until I couldn't feel the lip with my fingernail.

I'm quite happy with the result.  It took several weeks of procrastinating, at least an hour of dremel frustration, several hours of shopping to figure out the right bit, and finally a few minutes of doing.  I used the 12.4mm Bohrcraft cobalt countersink (1710 series); not sure if a cheaper bit would've worked -- I don't have much metalworking experience -- but I wanted to err on the side of too good at the cost of a few bucks, as I wasn't interested in doing cleanup for the cleanup's cleanup.

Hope this helps someone to convert their shanks.  It's really just a few-minute job (plus time required for taking the old ones out, cleaning the cutting oil off with TSP afterwards, re-building, etc.).  Obviously, the conversion works only for stainless steel shanks, not chrome-plated ones.  Also noteworthy, and something that I didn't think of in advance: the stunt makes the shank ""shorter"" since the Duotight fitting needs to screw on, so make sure it's a long enough shank or that you have a way to drill a recess for the Duotight fitting.",Homebrewing

"Wind Malt / Jovaru Mixed Ferm My Reddit app was glitching all day after I posted this so I took it down and am re-posting. 

I brewed a beer yesterday that I’ll be racking into mulberries and pitching a undecided brett strain into. 

Exact recipe is in photos. 

Wind Malt, wheat, oats and rye. Wind Malt has almost no color and is lighter than wheat malt in SRM and needs some step mashed but has more enzymatic power than any other malt that I’m aware of due to it not being kilned. It’s dried via the sun/wind. 

I did a 20 min mash at 134*f, stepped up to 158*f then did a 15 min decoction to add color and melanoidin to the beer. In my opinion it worked beautifully, the wort came out looking like honey. 

I used Hallertau &amp; Godiva hops. Godiva are a “new” hop that come from the UK. Slightly spicy with a strong gooseberry flavor/nose. 

I also added .25 oz of dried chamomile flowers. 

This may seem like a kitchen sink beer but the wort came out great and the flowers melded wonderfully. I pitched with Omega’s Jovaru at 90*f. The yeast gives off strong lemon pitch and pepper notes, ferments super dry but leaves a ton of glycerol that adds mouthfeel and body. 

My hopes is that the chamomile and gooseberry hop flavor meld well with the earthy-berry flavor from the mulberries and brett. This is my first “mixed Ferm” beer so I really don’t know what to expect. 

If anyone has any suggestions on a particular brett strain let me know.

"Can 3 gallons of a 1.061 OG ferment down to 1.012 in a few days? I went away for a few days and when I came back I noticed I had signs of a really active fermentation: high krausen up into the blow off tube, active bubbling... I left it alone for another day or so then came back to it. It looked like it slowed down a lot: no bubbling, no krausen, and beer looked like it cleared up some.

"Philly sour tolerance? So I am brewing my first ever beer. I went to my local brew shop and they gave me 5 pounds of dry malt extract. I did everything according to direction did the 60 minute boil, hopped, and chilled. After siphoning into my car boy I checked the gravity and it is 1.060. The guy at the brew store told me with that amount of extract we would get about 5.4%, but that gravity is making me think it will be closer to 8%

I am using Philly sour yeast, because I like sour beer, and their website says it has a tolerance of 9%. I’m assuming my brew conditions are going to be less than perfect so I’m afraid it will cause problems.


Do you all think I will be OK? I’ve done ciders before and like them to ferment all the way dry. Does beer also need to ferment until dry?

"7% Hazy IPA - Riwaka Hops Front and Center! Hey my dudes. I'm back with another NEIPA, similar to my last with the grain bill and brewing approach. You'll notice if you have looked at any of my stuff before I don't deviate much from my grain bill from batch to batch. I change up the hops and yeast mostly, with minor tweaks of things here and there. 

[Here's the recipe, pics, insight, tasting notes from start to finish.](https://simplehomebrew.wordpress.com/2020/12/10/hazy-ipa-riwaka/)

After /u/theant06 told me to get my hands on the 2020 crop of Riwaka - speaking from his experience with the 2019 crop, I went ahead and stocked up on 5lbs of the 2020 crop. They seem to have gotten a better yield this year as last I checked Yakima Valley still had it in stock. 

If you haven't used Riwaka in your hazy IPAs, I highly recommend giving it a try. It is so flavorful without being overwhelming. I'm super pleased with my results on this batch.

"Great guidance if you want to bottle NEIPAs For anyone who hasn't seen it, this is an excellent guide on bottling NEIPAs while minimizing oxidation:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/d0c6hn/actually_you_can_bottle_neipas_at_home_or_how_i/

I just finished the last of my NEIPAs I bottled on November 8th, and it still tastes excellent, with barely any change in color. If you're interested in brewing NEIPAs but can't/don't want to keg, I strongly recommend you take a look.

A couple notes on my tweaks to the process:

* I've got a Tilt, so I bottled when it was at 1.020 gravity. This happened 56 hours after pitching the yeast, so pretty close to the recommended 48 hour wait. Dry hops were in the fermenter a total of 5 days before bottling.

* I fill the bottles to the brim, adding a bit extra to fill up the bottle after I pull out the bottling wand. No idea how big of a difference it makes, but I like the idea of minimizing in bottle oxygen.

* I think the process works better with a higher quality bottle capper. My last NEIPA before this, I followed basically the same process, and noted that a few of the bottles were noticeably oxidized after a few weeks, but others were not. I speculated this was due to to the quality of the cap's seal. For this NEIPA I used a higher quality bench capper, and every bottle was great.

* Be careful when pouring the beer! There will be a small but significant amount of trub at the bottom of the bottle, since you're not cold crashing- make sure it doesn't end up in your glass.",Homebrewing
"Anvil Foundry vs Clawhammer 120v Looking at the electric set up, I am limited to 110/120v due to no 220/240v in the house. I understand the differences in heat up time, and I've made my peace with that.

My question is between the aforementioned systems, is the cost for the Clawhammer over the Anvil Foundry worth it?

"Wind Malt / Mixed Fermentation On Mulberries. Brewed my first mixed fermentation beer today. I am pitching primary with Omega’s Jovaru. After primary I’m racking onto some mulberries I picked over the summer and pitching with Brett. Any suggestions on a Brett strain is welcome. This is new territory for me. 

All malt cake from Sugar Creek Malt Co. Exact recipe is in photos. I used wind malt, wheat, oats and rye. For hops I used Hellertau &amp; Godiva (gooseberry) and some dried chamomile. 

The Jovaru yeast should shine with the hops and chamomile. It gives off a strong lemon pith and pepper note, along with a lot of glycerol making it a dry beer with lots of body. I don’t know if brett eats glycerol or not, but I’ll find out in about 6 months. 

I mashed at 134F for 20 min then stepped up to 158F. At the end of my mash I did a single decoction to get some color and melanoidin off the malt. Wind Malt is as pale as it gets, figured a little color would help. It went into the fermentor looking like honey. 

I’m really excited to see how this beer turns out after primary and then onto letting the brett have its way with it.

I plan on bottling 5gal of of the base beer (a funky saison, 1.005 FG), as well as a 50/50 (2.5gal/2.5gal) blend of that and another sour (1.010 FG). The calculator states for the 5gal of the base saison alone has: 0.43 Residual CO2, and 0.43 Predict CO2 w/o Sugar -&gt; needing **7.75 oz table sugar** to hit 3.2 vols  


But when crunching the numbers for a 50/50 blend, the sheet states the combined components have 0.43 Residual CO2 and *1.71 Predict CO2 w/o Sugar* \-&gt; needing **4.18 oz table sugar** to hit 3.2 vols  


It seems from a practical aspect, blending two similar beers with the same residual CO2 should yield the same ""Predict CO2 w/o sugar"" as only one. **Why does the ""Predicted CO2 w/o sugar"" more than quadruple when blending?** I'd like to wrap my head around this and be able to trust this sheet, as it's the matter of a difference of *3.6 oz sugar* and the potential to vastly undercarbonate a great beer.

"Any insights for S23 fermentation schedule/time? I brewed a cream ale recipe last Sunday that was one of my LHBS house recipes, and the yeast they provided was S23.  i did a double take since this was an ale, but I called back to verify and they said that it was correct.  Brew day went fine, pitched the yeast at around 75F (no starter), and brought down to my fermentation fridge set to 55 on Sunday afternoon.

I saw airlock activity had stopped this morning, so I thought I'd grab a gravity sample.  I'm fermenting in an SS Brewbucket, so I have a valve to grab samples from the bottom - no biggie.  It came out looking like [this, aka superchunky from hell](https://imgur.com/eWe0MDz).  Obviously there is still a crapload of yeast in suspension, and I was wondering if anybody had any insight as to when it's likely to drop out - I thought S23 was supposed to be bottom fermenting?

Aside from it having the consistency of a milkshake, the flavor seems about right for what I was expecting.  My larger issue is when I should consider pulling it from the fermentation fridge for a diacetyl rest since I clearly am not going to get an accurate gravity reading with all that crap still in there.  Should I just wait until day 10 and try again?

- I would like to naturally carbonate my beer via spunding while also using up an residual dissolved oxygen post transfer.
- My spiedel fermenter can't hold enough pressure to carbonate but can hold about 2 psi which I use to pressure transfer.
- For ease, I'd like to use the unfermented sugar as opposed to adding a sugar solution.
- Previously I have just transferred to a keg with a 1-2 Plato left which carbonated fine the but left a VERY unclear beer (still murky 4 weeks in the keezer

My Plan:
- Cold crash when 2-3 Plato estimated left
- Hold for a day or two
- Pressure transfer to keg
- Attach spunding valve and let keg warm back up to fermentation temp to carbonate


Other thoughts:
- I think it should work as it's no different than cold crashing then adding a sugar solution
- I'm trying to minimize the number of transfers. I've also previously transferred to a keg to carbonate then transferred again to a serving keg but that's more cleaning and more CO2 wasted. 
- I don't have a Clear Beer draft system yet but may look into it. 

Anyone see any issues?",Homebrewing
"Should I measure temp of beer or air while fermentation in a chamber I'm building a fermentation chamber out of a mini fridge and I'm wondering if its better to measure air, the fermenter, or even the beer itself for that matter. I'm afraid if you measure the beer or fermenter directly, the fridge will stay on or off for much longer (due to the larger thermal mass). Which could result in larger sways in temperature of the beer compared to if you measure the air. On the flip side if you're measuring air and the fermentation is heating up the beer, you might not be cooling it properly and never know. Any thoughts?",Homebrewing

"Can Bretts save my beer? Let me describe the situation. I brewed a heavy hopped beer few days ago, 19blg, almost 200g of flameout hops. I used m66(mangroves jack's) yeast for the first time and they went like crazy in my fermenter. I didn't notice the raise of the temperature in  first 24 h or less and now it has a lot of bubblegum aroma. It's not that bad, thankfully there's no alcohol fusels aroma but the bubblegum covers the hops. I planned to heavy dry hop it, but since it's ""kind"" of ruined I was thinking about adding some bring of the funk( oyl 212 from omega, it's a mix of Bretts)  for secondary. I already tried them in one beer as secondary fermentation yeasts and I was more than happy.

"Creating desert stouts starting with stout kits as a base Howdy! This is my first post on the sub. Been brewing from kits for around 6 months now. Nothing but success and excellent beer, but the best thing I've done is take a St Peter's Cream Stout kit and add blackberries and roast cocoa nibs in secondary to make a blackberry porter. 
 
Stouts/porters, especially adventurous desert stouts, are my favourite drink. I plan on experiment with malt extract, lactose, chocolate, coffee, fruit, treacle, etc in 2021. 

Obviously there are loads of all-grain recipes for such desert stouts, but I live in a small flat with a crap kitchen, so I can't go all-grain. Instead, I have to start from a kit base, and do all my flavour additions in secondary.

The question is: which stout kits would lend themselves best to being the basis for a desert stout? Ideally I'd get a few of the same kit and go off in different directions with each iteration. The St Peter's Cream Stout was nice, but it's expensive, and I'm wondering which other ones might lend themselves well to this purpose.

"A note for anyone considering a 10G Spike Solo I recently had my first brew day on my pre-sale 10G Spike Solo.  Overall the day was very smooth.  It took me barely 25 minutes to get from 60 degree groundwater up to 158, and then maybe 15 minutes post-mash to get up to boil.  Clean-up was simple.  The thing is a beast and will probably outlive me... the kettle and basket with all tri-clamps attached is almost 40 pounds.

There is one thing that caught me off guard though that isn't listed in any of the online information, so I wanted to drop a mention here.

With the 10G version, when hanging the basket from the stainless hooks, the bottom of the basket sits between the 6 and 6.5 gallon mark (it hangs at a slight angle).  My system setup is I believe fairly typical (5 gallons into keg, half a gallon loss to fermenter, half a gallon loss to kettle trub, 1 gallon/hour boil-off, so pre-boil volume is 7G cold) so the bottom couple of inches of grain was fully submerged and wasn't able to drain.  This left behind a bunch of wort in the grain when I pulled the basket, as well as making a mess.

I reached out to Spike's customer support and confirmed that this is the expected level of the basket.  Unfortunately, this means that for the basket to be able to drain while hanging, the biggest batch size is 5 gallons _only if_ you don't count any loss for trub or fermentation, and limit to a 60 minute boil... so realistically, it's more like 4 gallons into the keg.  To be able to manage a larger batch size, the choices are basically to deal with the submerged grain, add top-up water pre-boil, or use a hoist instead of the hooks.

The basket draining method one was of the features that I was looking forward to with the Solo since I didn't want a hoist, so I'm a bit disappointed that it won't work as expected.  I've suggested to their support that they include this information in their FAQs (maybe the [Basket Dimensions](https://help.spikebrewing.com/knowledge/will-the-solo-basket-fit-non-spike-kettles)).  So, I'm writing here in case this information is useful to someone (especially if you're on the fence between the 10G and the 15G).",Homebrewing

"Typical Expense I was looking through some recipes on Brewer’s Friend, and there was a very highly rated NEIPA at the top of the list. I looked through the grain bill and hop bill and decided to put all the ingredients in a cart on Northern Brewer, just to get a price reference. I put each grain in to the next pound, which is the smallest unit you can buy. I don’t have a grain mill so I chose to have them pre-milled. I chose the hops based on 8oz packs because it was cheaper than the individual 1oz packs in the quantities required. A total of almost 14 lbs of grain and 14 Oz of hops. So there would be a small amount leftover to start building an inventory, but not much.

It was $111, plus $21 for the water treatment salts they specified for the water profile (I’ve never done any water treatment so that would be my initial buy-in of those packages). Of course those would get used for a long time after, but still an expense for me to do it by the recipe.

Is that a normal amount to pay for smaller packages of ingredients like that? Does one have to have the space to store large quantities of malts to be able to brew from recipes instead of recipe kits? Is NB just expensive? I haven’t priced this through my LHBS yet, who I would prefer to patronize.

"Some advice for a college student? Hey everyone, 

I've been brewing at home twice now. First time was in my previous house, which had a gas stove, which worked reasonably well. Second time was in my current house, on an electric stove. Which is really, really difficult. I simply can't keep up with the rising and falling temperatures, and as the stove only has 6 different settings (excluding 'off'), I don't have a lot of room.

* 2lbs Unmalted Wheat (\~15%)
* 1lb Vienna (\~8%)
* 8oz. Oats
* Mash @ 156F and boil for 1 hour

* Not planning to rack to secondary - will keep on the yeast cake until it is ready to bottle (12 months+)

* Will cool the wort down to safe temps for my fermenter bucket (\~100F) or so and let it naturally cool down with a fan pointed at it in my backyard for several hours. 
* Once cool I'll close it up and put an airlock on and wait for primary to finish.  After primary is complete I'll rack to a secondary vessel and will add some oak chips (again - thoughts on how much to add for a lightly oaked batch?)

"Quantifying spice additions? Ok, don't judge, just give me a lead and I'll learn my own lessons. Preface, I have never used spices in my brewing to date. But, I have a concept for a beer that would include a HINT of cardamom. I realize this spice is very potent. I've read around and the census is not much. Note, this is only a 10L batch. My options in house are green whole pods , or ground (seemingly dark).

"Is a Partially Closed Transfer to Keg Worth It? I'm getting some parts so that I can do a closed transfer starting my next brew. 

In the meantime I have a balloon (cold crash guardian) attached to my fermenter that is cold crashing to prevent O2 exposure. I plan to purge the keg of C02 by pushing out sanitizer and transferring through the liquid post. 

The balloon will still have some CO2 in it but not enough to displace the beer in the fermenter as it fills up the keg, so there will be some oxygen exposure. 

Is doing this worth it for this batch since there will still be some oxygen exposure? Or should I just keg without too much worry like I have before? I plan on adding SMB to the keg for the first time as well to  minimize oxidation. It's a Pale Ale

"Accidental cider fermentation Hey guys. I know you probably read this type of post all the time, but old posts still didn't answer my question. I have no experiencing brewing, only drinking ;) 

   Basically i'm wondering if it's possible to make an alcoholic cider from a bottle of cider I recently purchased, which seems to be undergoing some kind of fermentation. I think maybe the fridge door didn't close completely, causing it to be exposed to warmer temps. It is a 1-gallon jug. It had already been opened. It is from a local orchard but was sold at the local grocery. It is pasteurized, but has no preservatives. It says the sell by date is 12/10 and it is 12/8 today. 

  When i went to take it from the fridge earlier today, the plastic jug was so bloated that I couldn't grab it by the handle. When I took off the lid, it make a BIG hiss. It smells a little like apple cider vinegar. I liked a couple small holes in a balloon and placed on the top. The balloon filled with gas. Should i put it back in my fridge or expose it to warmer temps? Is it even possible to make this a hard cider or should i pitch it?

"Why can't I put carbonation drops in the fermenter? I'm new to homebrewing and still learning the fundamentals. I've read that the easiest way to carbonate is to add carbonation drops to the bottles and then bottling. I know you can also use priming sugar. But so far, the only method I've read about to carbonate the brew INSIDE the fermenter is to use special pressurizing equipment (which I won't be attempting anytime soon).

So why not just add the carbonation drops to the fermenter, instead of to each bottle individually? Won't it have the same effect if I use the exact same amount of drops?

Another question: If the brew is perfectly carbonated inside the fermenter, could I just skip bottling entirely and fill a glass straight from the fermenter?

"My experience with Philly Sour. Any tips for improvement?   

I want to share my experience with Philly Sour yeast so maybe I can answer some questions with my experience and get some tips on how to improve things that did not go exactly to plan. 

My 5 gallon Recipe:

9 lb Pilsner

4 lb Wheat

1 lb Dextrose (10 min)

Irish moss (10 min)

Mashed for an hour at 152F with a mashout of 10 minutes at 170F. 

60 minute boil. No Hops.

5 lb Cherry Pie filling in secondary 

I pitched 2 packets of Philly Sour into about 5.5 gallons at about 70F. I hit an OG of 1.064. Fermentation went hard for about 2 days bringing gravity to 1.048. At that point, my temperature had dropped to about 66F (recommended temps are 68-77F). I was able to get temps back up to 73-76F for the rest of the way. After the initial fermentation, it stayed at 1.048 for about 2 days. I was worried at that point that it had stalled but did some research and read about others with the same experience. At about day 5 it kicked off hard again for about 3 days to get to 1.015. I left it in for another 2 days where it stayed at 1.015. I measured PH at that point to be 3.59. Not as low as I would have liked (I like a really sour beer). I would have liked to get around 3.2-3.3. I put in secondary with 5lbs of cherry pie filling. I left it at 73F for two days until I saw that the color blended and then I put into the fridge to cold crash for 4 days (I added gelatin after day 1). Upon kegging, the cherry pie filling had caused about a gallon of loss. Once carbonated, I tasted and it was a little sour, like I said not as sour as I would like and the cherry flavor was subtle if any. 

Note: I received my water report later on and my PH is 8.1. 

Some things I would like to improve – I would like to get my PH down to 3.2-3.3. Maybe I should try kettle souring and then pitching another yeast? I use an Anvil Foundry, is it cool to leave it in there while souring?

"Plastic Fermenters? I have been brewing beer at home for over 10-years, always using the traditional 6-gal. glass carboy for fermentation. My beers are typically drinkable, rarely experiencing much oxidation. But, since I’ve been mostly brewing IPA that get dry hopped, I’ve found it difficult to extract clean beer from the fermenter, since I have to drop hop pellets directly into the carboy. My buddy has some stainless conical style fermenters, and these seem fantastic—a big open top so you can drop a mesh bag of hops in, and a funnel shaped base that allows for yeast harvest/trub separation.

"First brew on the Brewzilla...think this one needs to be called Murphy's Law Red TL;DR - First brew on the Brewzilla went tits-up, but stumbled into a success anyways.

I picked up a Brewzilla on Black Friday and decided to do my first brew with it today.  I'm still pretty new to brewing, I've done 4 brews up to this point but wanted to move to all-grain and due to space needs the all-in-one systems were the best option for me.  This weekend I unboxed the zilla cleaned it and got myself familiar with the control panel, program steps, and how long it took to get to temperature in preparation for brewing today.  This morning I set the timer so that it would start warming up about an hour and a half before I got home from work and hit start. My wife was working from home so made sure she knew that it would be turning on this afternoon, then out the door I went.  This became issue number one...whatever I did this morning for the timer was not what I did this weekend, as it apparently started heating up immediately. About 2 and a half hours into my work day my wife called me saying that it wouldn't stop beeping so she paused it because that was the only way she could get it to shut up.  I told her that was fine and I would call on my way home and tell her how to start it in manual mode.  This leads in to the only smooth part of the brew day, when I got home the water was 3 degrees shy if my mash in temp and I was able to get the mash started right away and that went just like every brew video I had watched for this thing.  While the mash was happening I started to prep for the boil and eventual cooling.  I don't have a hop spider so my plan was to use small muslin bags for the hop additions, but my dog ate my muslin bags.  My plan was to pump the wort through the chiller submerged in an ice bath I thought the chiller connection kit came with silicone hoses, but I was wrong and it is vinyl hose which Im not gonna pump hot liquid through. So I decided to run to the LHBS and get some silicone tubing and new muslin bags while the wort was coming up to a boil...but...I forgot the LHBS changed their hours due to Covid and they were closed when I got there.  Stopped for dinner at Whataburger for the family...not a single order was made correctly.  Now the boil is coming to an end, I decided I'll just used the chiller as an immersion chiller...and sonnofabitch...the sprayer is seized to the hose...goddamnitmitherhellbitch...the hose is seized to the hose bib.  So now I just gotta run the recirc pump and let this come down to temp the long way.

"Brewing with raw wheat update Hey folks,

Asked a few days ago about brewing with unmalted wheat (wheat berries in this case, not flaked or torrified).

Since I got so many different answers, I decided to try out a single 90min infusion instead of messing around. I was planning on reaching about 65% mash efficiency, but had to scale up my water and hops because with a 90min single infusion of 50/50 pilsner and unmalted wheat berries, I achieved a mash efficiency of 79%.

I milled my pilsner and my wheat berries in my mill at the smallest gap, ran it through a second time, and mixed in half a pound of rice hulls. Mashed @150 walked away for 90min while it recirculated, and then came back to ramp up to mash out temp @168 to make lautering a little easier and left it recirculate for another 15 mins. 

I prepared 10gallons of water total incase of increased absorption, despite requiring 8.7gallons. Planned to mash with 5ish and sparge with 4ish. Ended up using all of it in the sparge.

"Brewing a stout for the first time and need advice What are the best ways to add coffee and chocolate to a kinda big stout? (OG: 1.080) i expect it to finish in the 1.025 region or lower.

"Canning from a Keg for maximum carbonation and shelf-stability?   

Hello everyone. I’ve got the homebrew-scale version of the Oktober can seamer (SL1), and I love it. Up until now, I have been can-conditioning\* my beer. I prime just like you’d do with bottles, and fill as high as I can to minimize air/head space. With a few odd exceptions, I’ve had great results!

I recently bought a keezer (during the great freezer shortage of 2020, no less!), and now I’m falling back into my lazy kegging ways. However, I’d still like to can beers from my kegs. But, it’s been kind of challenging to find specific information for doing this from a homebrew perspective. Most of the stuff online is for someone working at the counter of a microbrewery, and hurriedly and sloppily “capping on foam” and handing the crowler back to the customer, and maybe wiping the sides a few times with a bar rag. I’m looking for something much more “shelf-stable” than that, something that can keep for months. 

I’m assuming the same rules from bottling apply:

**All methods:**

1. Make sure cans are cold, but not frozen
2. Minimize foaming any way you can (see above)
3. Sanitize the cans (I’ve been using a sulfite solution instead of Star San lately with great results, I brew lots of beers with massive whirlpool and dry hop additions so I’m pretty oxyphobic!)
4. Use the lowest PSI on the regulator you can that will still push beer (and be sure to “burp” the kegs first!)

**Lazy method:**

* Straight from a tap/picnic tap, try to minimize foam

**Intermediate lazy method:**

* Run tubing from tap/keg/etc with a traditional bottling wand jammed in it

**DIY beer gun:**

* Use a homemade contraption that’s like the Blichmann gun, but way cheaper.

**Expensive beer gun:**

* Buy the latest gear from Blichmann so you can CO2 purge

Would anything be different with cans? Maybe the CO2 purging would be less effective? Any other tips I’m missing?

"Kegging: Regulator dropped set point I'm new to kegging and have a question.

I put my Co2 cylinder and reg in the fridge which was still fairly warm and set the reg to 12 psi to carb the two kegs. after 6 hours in the fridge the temp had dropped to about 6c (42.8f) and the reg showed a new set point of 8 or 9. I thought it was odd, and set it back to 12psi. the next morning the fridge was down to about 2c (36f) and the reg was once again showing a set point of 8. I left it there over night again, I wanted to take a look on line to see if I could figure it out.

Am i right in thinking that as the temp dropped the setting on the dial would also drop? 

Am I fine to go back to the 12 psi setting as my temp in the fridge is pretty much stabilized?

I read a few posts that suggested it but I had to ask.

I'm thinking that I shouldn't have bothered to set the reg to my desired setting until the temp in the fridge hit operating temp and the beer in the kegs had been chilled to the right temp.

I'm confident that I don't have a leak, well kinda confident. I checked all the connections that were either factory or the ones that I changed out, no leaks. The kegs, while used, showed up under pressure.

Am I right in my assumptions about the reg and temp? I'd like to set the reg back to 12 again, but I was afraid that I might open the fridge tomorrow and see all of the changes come back and instead of being 12 it's 20 or higher!

"How to Make Traditional Chinese Rice Wine and Common Mistakes I came through a sake post where people were talking about fermenting rice. My family has been making traditional Chinese rice wine for a long time. I was drinking/eating my grandmother's creation since I was a wee baby before immigrating to United States in my teen years when my parents stopped supplying me rice wine because it was against the law. Since moving to the US, my mother had made many batches of rice wines and I have also made multiples in college (I do more beer brewing though). I will write out the recipe below 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Soak sticky rice for 6-10 hours, steam them through (don't cook them like regular rice)
2. After rice cools down, sprinkle crushed yeast ball into the rice and mix (get them in Chinese markets or Amazon) Each ball can do around 1 pound dry rice.
3. Pack the rice mixture into a clear container (NO ADDITIONAL WATER !) 
4. (If you are also using red yeast rice: sprinkle the grinded down red yeast rice on top) If not just ignore this step, they can also be found in Chinese markets or on Amazon
5. Use a spoon or an utensil to dig a well in the middle.
6. Cover the glass container and let it ferment (important to cover up), 
7. When there's liquid in the center well (usually 3-5 days if it's warm or up to a week in winter) you've got yourself a delish low abv rice wine, put it in the fridge to stop it from fermenting or leave it out a couple more days to get a stronger one. It can be stored in fridge for a couple weeks. 
8. If you let it sit more outside, rice would float to the top 

These following points need to be followed for an authentic Chinese rice wine experience

1. You need to use Sticky Rice (find them at any Asian supermarkets)
2. The rice need to be soaked then steamed, not cooked in water
3. You should not add any water to the rice after soaking initially, the alcohol will come out of the rice 
4. Don't stir, let it sit 
5. It should be a low abv sweet wine generally under 5% abv
6. Don't discard the rice, eat them, they taste sweet and boozy 
7. Try cooking with the fermented rice [https://thewoksoflife.com/sweet-fermented-rice-jiu-niang/](https://thewoksoflife.com/sweet-fermented-rice-jiu-niang/) that seems to be a good recipe",Homebrewing
"HELP! Disaster aversions advice required. Hi homebrew crew.

I am trying to avert a minor disaster. I have had my Christmas booze brewing for a while now and most of it is happily clearing. I have some strong Yorkshire ale, some Russian stout, some red fruit cider and some desperados style larger.

All are form kits.

The Desperados is actually the Mexican beer from bulldog with some tequila mix added for the 2nd fermentation along with some lime cordial. This is my problem beer. It has another week or two to clear and to be ready to be drunk. However today in testing I discovered there is a crack in the barrel. The result of which is that the beer is not fizzy. This, in and of itself, isn't a huge issue as it tastes great. (I will share the process for making desperados style beer from a kit if anyone is interested in the future)

As I see things I have 3 options to save this beer.

1. do nothing, drink it quickly (23 litres) adding propellant gas to the keg as we go and hope not too much O2 gets in to spoil it
2. rack it into another keg re-gas and drink from there, will still be pretty flat but tastes good so what the hey
3. rack it into another keg with brewing sugar, have another fermentation and drink it in February
4. bin it... not going to happen

My problem is the following; I don't have the space or equipment do to all-grain brewing. So I'm working with extracts. It worked quite well for my first homebrew; I replaced the base malt with a similar extract and the specialty grains were clearly pointed out in the recipe.

"Help! Will i get heavy metal poisoning if I drink this? Bit of a long explanation but bare with me, I was making a mango and peach cider and when I checked about 2 weeks in it stinked of sulphur, I had forgotten to put yeast nutrient in. After a quick Google I saw that you could splash rack it at the risk of oxidation. A beer hack I like to do with my IPAs to prevent oxidation is to add vitamin C so I thought it would be a good idea to add it to the cider so I did before splash racking it. But still no dice it stunk of sulphur something terrible. After some more googling I put three copper coins and a tiny coil of copper wire in a hop bag and put them in the fermentor for three hours. The idea here being that the copper reacts with the sulphur and then drops out of solution and any leftover can be cleared with bentonite which is what I was planning on doing. However I know the vitamin C can react with metal particles to form superoxidisers and oxidise the cider heavily which I'm honesty not too worried about.

"Mead questions Hi guys,

I am currently making some mead and it is a little bitter. I have used the 3 lbs of honey per gallon as suggested but it doesn’t seem to be as sweet as it should be. I think the reason why is that the must was too warm when I added in the yeast. It has been fermenting for about 3 weeks now and I just sampled it. Is it possible to add in more yeast to make it sweeter this late? Is there anything that can be done to adjust the sweetness or is this batch just gonna be bitter? It’s definitely still fermenting but it does not seem to have the activity as my previous batch. My guess is the yeast were largely killed off by the heat. 

Thanks!",Homebrewing
"Quick thoughts on a spur of the moment brew day. I’m going to brew a beer today. My brother took my propane tank and I’m not getting it back today. 
Original plan was a 5gal all grain batch made in a 15gal pot on a propane burner. 
New plan is to mash the same grains in my 5 gal pot on the stove and at the end of the day top up in the fermenter to desired OG. 

Mash at 153-155F
9LBS 2-row
1.7 oz crystal 40
1oz centennial at 60
1oz centennial at 15
1oz centennial at flameout. 
Us-05
Estimated OG of 1.057

These are all ingredients I’ve had sitting around for a year. Unmilled grains in bag/sealed containers, and hops in the freezer. The centennial bag was open too. I shall call this Old Dusty",Homebrewing
"Wacky mixed ferm (ft. cool pellicle) So I started this beer December 2019. It began as a pretty standard saison with lime zest (90/10 pils and wheat, saisonstein's monster yeast,) after primary was done I pitched Bootleg Biology's Funk Weapon 3 and let that ride until July 2020. at that point I tossed in around two pounds of pineapple and a pound of mango, and tossed in a little belle saison yeast to make sure those sugars got dealt with. 

Cracked into it yesterday and [whoaaaa pellicle](https://imgur.com/a/cpw1mEa). 

[And in a glass.

It tastes fantastic. The fruity notes come through more than anything, but there's some funky brett quality going on as well. Not really much saison character or sourness to it, but no complaints from me. Gonna be kegging it in the next few weeks. Firm believer in Funk Weapon 3.

"Does blowoff tube diameter matter?

It's been working well, but I'm brewing some belgians soon, and since too much pressure in the fermenter can decrease ester production I'm wondering if 1/4th inch is too thin.

"Fruited Sour So I am making my first sour. A Philly sour. I added about a pound of pureed Raspberry at the very end of the boil to aid in lactic acid production of the yeast. And plan to add another 2lbs of Raspberry in the fermenter along with some other adjuncts. I have read up on some advice and I cannot decide what is the best route for me.

I am using a Spike Flex+ fermenter and fermentation is about halfway complete. This yeast seems to be slow and steady.

At first I planned on adding the puree now(halfway to FG). Then I thought maybe fermentation might affect the fruit flavor. However, my OG ended up lower than planned  so I thought this might give it a boost.

Plan 2. Post fermentation. I don't do secondary. Think adding fruit after fermentation without racking off yeast is a problem? (Can't dump yeast with the Flex)

Plan 3. I don't have another fermenter other than a bucket. I could rack into a bucket with the fruit. I am a bit obsessed about oxygen ingress so I'm not a fan of this...however willing to do whatever is best.

"Brett brux questions I brewed a grisette using WLP565 Belgian saison yeast that finished fermentation at 1.005 SG, then racked it into secondary and pitched brett brux into it (my first time using brett).  3 months later, there’s no pellicle and another hydrometer gravity measurement showed exactly the same 1.005 SG, but tasting from the hydrometer tube definitely brought the funk flavors I’d been looking for with the brett.  

I am certainly open to the possibility of human error on the two SG measurements but haven’t experienced anything weird using this hydrometer before.  My two questions are:

1) I’d like to bottle this batch.  Should I use priming sugar and/or bottling yeast, or will that get me bottle bombs, and I should just bottle with nothing extra and assume the brett will keep chewing on sugars and generate carbonation over the long haul? 
2) The reason I’d like to bottle this batch is that I’m brewing a saison tonight and have the idea of pitching it onto the brett cake in 3 weeks.  Can you reuse a brett cake from secondary?  Given the lack of pellicle and apparent lack of attenuation of the previous beer in secondary, will this brett cake do much with the saison when I rack it on there?

Any insight would be much appreciated!  Thank you!",Homebrewing
"Do not overlook water chemistry Since I started brewing, I avoided thinking about water chemistry despite all of the evidence that it's one of the most important parts of beer. Then yesterday I tasted the water profile series from Mikkelier: four pilsners brewed with four different water profiles. Not only was the difference immediately obvious, but one of the beers was downright disgusting (Pacific profile).

What was really interesting about this test specifically is that it was a simple pale pilsner, so there was nothing else to mask how the water flavor influenced the beer. I highly recommend you get your hands on these or try to do a similar water profile taste test. It'll change how you brew forever.

"Are Partial Mashes Really This Good? Hey everyone! 6-7 years ago I started brewing. First I began with basic kits that didn't make great beers, but as time went on I learned more and more and started all grain BIAB and non-BIAB brews. I did this for about 6+ of those years. Recently, while making a few batches for Christmas season when friends come over, I decided I was pressed for time (I aimed for 5 separate beers - all bottled conditioned), so without much time, I said ""shag it"" and went with a partial mash recipe I came up with on the fly for 2 beers. Essentially, I made a split batch with the same beer, except that one I added some post-mash oats for additional body. I did one with just EKG and the other as a sort of red IPA. Both hit 5.5% ABV.

I had a few ideas for what to do to make sure the beer was going to be decent. I added yeast nutrient, which I never do, and I made sure to do a good step mash on the few grains I did mash. I also made sure to have great yeast starters for both. The result? Two blow offs (one of which actually knocked off the airlock)! What an active ferment.

Anyhow, I tried both today while bottling and I can already tell that these two beers are by far the two best beers I've ever made. I'm blown away. I felt like I was somewhat cheating the process, but man oh man if this is the result.....I don't know if I can go back to full all grain. Less clean up, less fuss with grains, easily hitting gravities....and the clean crisp taste and unbelievably remarkable clarity. Damn.

"India Pale Lager - Recipe and notes Wanted to dive into lagers a bit more, but still love a great hoppy beer, so the combination was appealing. 

I had a few goals with this brew:
- A balanced, but crushable beer with a noticable hop presence
- The final product still reads like a lager
- Test out the effectiveness of a hot (185F) whirlpool for bitterness and aroma
- See if Idaho-7 is the miracle hop people say it is

Here's the recipe:

OG - 1.050
FG - 1.009
IBU - 45
ABV - 5.2%

7# Rahr Domestic Pilsner
2# Weyermann Vienna
0.5# Crystal-20
0.5# Belgian Biscuit

0.5 oz Cascade @60
0.5 oz Cascade @10
1 oz Idaho-7 @10

1 oz each Idaho-7 and Mosaic 185F Whirlpool for 15 min

1 oz each Idaho-7 and Mosaic dry hop

Fermented with S-33 @55F, raised to 60F after seven days. Cold crashed at terminal, kegged, then cold conditioned 3 weeks.

http://imgur.com/gallery/PxR1S4O

The final product is, in a word, fantastic. It is crisp and light like a lager, with a wonderful aroma and smooth bitterness that follows through to the finish. The aroma isn't overwhelming but has sweet berry and cherry notes. The taste is a touch sweet with biscuity malt notes, and a brightness from the Cascade that I think pairs really well with a lager body.

I'd love to see more brewers take a crack at the style. Subtlety and balance can be difficult but very rewarding.

I don't have a ton of space... So I'm torn. I could just throw it all in the spon once it shows no mold, but then I don't get to blend.

I could also do another 7 gallons of lambic style wort soon, get another carboy (or sacrifice a bucket) and put the BB packs into it, and the samples into a couple 1 gal jugs, split by lambic / gueuze or various mixed cultures. Then I'd be able to blend in a year... But I'm running low on storage space and that seems like quite a bit of extra effort.

"What did I make and how did it happen? So a long time ago I had a job at edible arrangements and noticed that after they cut the heart out of the pineapple core they just throw away the rest of the pineapple.. the most edible and most delicious part of the pineapple.... Sooo I took it home. I ended up with like 50lbs of pineapple so i gave a ton of it away.

Anyways I ended up with a ridiculous amount of pineapple juice enough to fill bottles up with. one bottle was a pop cap bottle and this bottle got forgotten in the fridge for awhile. about a couple weeks in we cracked it craving pineapple juice and discovered it fermented a little bit kuz it was a little bit fizzy but tasted wonderful!

I threw in a cinnamon stick and a couple cloves and let it sit for like another month or so... (we just forgot about it for awhile)

The time comes where we remember about our little bb in the fridge and we pop that bad boy open. the cap pops with the pressure of a shaken champagne bottle and lets out a 1/6 of the bottle in foam or whatever but the way those flavors developed in that bottle was AMAZING!! The pineapple cinnamon clove combo and the way the pineapple flavor had developed. It had a nice crisp fizz to it too that was just Soooo Right!

I just racked to the secondary after 10 days and the SG is only 1.043.  There is a lot of suspension and it hasn’t cleared at all.   Should I repitch the yeast (California Ale WLP-001) to help restart or let it ride and wait?",Homebrewing

"BIAB - bitter aftertaste help? Hi all. I'm having a problem with my last two BIAB batches. For some reason I'm ending up with a very weird, unpleasant bitter aftertaste. I recently made a strong bitter that had this problem but I figured it was because I overran the mash temps a bit and it's still pretty good.

I was making a saison yesterday and everything was going well. I hit my temps perfectly (although I didn't hit my gravity numbers...grumble) and had a good boil and whatnot. It seemed like things were on track. But then I took a sample of the wort and was displeased to find that same weird bitter aftertaste!

I don't think it's an equipment or process issue because none of that has changed and I've made great batches without this problem before.

"High ABV beer hasn't carbonated I've made a winter ale that is roughly 10.5% and uses Safale S-04 yeast. The final gravity was 1.018 as expected.
S-04 handles temperatures 12c and higher and has an alcohol tolerance of 9-11%. 

After two weeks I've noticed it's flat. I'm trying to decide if I leave it as it might take longer or if there are other solutions such as adding another higher tolerance yeast. 

My thoughts are that it could be 1 of 3 things. Too higher alcohol killed the yeast, it's a darker beer so taking longer to carbonate, the yeast settled more than normal so it's taking longer to carbonate as less yeast is suspended. 

What is most likely the cause and are there any remedies? 

If it's best to leave it then it's okay as it's turned out quite like a wine. S-04 seems to impart quite a tart flavour.",Homebrewing

I'll end up drinking it myself probably and saving several for next year to see if another year in the bottles does some magic. https://imgur.com/a/H7lFAAI

For those that are curious...this was an extract kit that I dressed up for Christmas. 7.5% ABV. It was slated as an amber ale, though it came out much darker. It came with mulling spices, and I added some extra cinnamon, and of course the rum barrel aging. Not easy to find rum oak. I used barrel chunks being sold for meat smoking (Amazon), charred those a little extra with a butane torch, and soaked them in cask strength rum to both sanitize and infuse more rum flavor. Dumped both the rum and wood in secondary for about 4 weeks. It's been in the bottles since June.

I don't have a great palate, but I'd say where it's lacking is in needing a stronger malt character to back up the spices. Maybe it's over spiced, and it fermented too warm, so it's a little boozy/harsh. I didn't add much rum, maybe 1/2 cup in 5 gal, but that could be part of it. Too long on the oak? Too short?

"%100 Rauchmalz update I posted a couple weeks back about brewing a %100 rauchmalz beer. The beer has been in keg for three days. Just thought I’d give a follow up since the keg is going into hibernation mode for a month or so to condition. 

[Såinnhus Rauchbeir ](https://imgur.com/gallery/AmDgXVl)

I used %100 rauchmalz that was fire kilned over beechwood fires. It’s not nearly as smoky as you’d imagine. I used hard well water from the farm animal hose for this beer and it’s spot on to style. Has a traditional Pilsner/Helles feel to it. It’s not brilliantly clear yet but a month or so in keg should help that. The noble hop character plays so well with the water profile and the slight malty back bone compliments the smokiness, ending very crisp. 

I didn’t have high expectations going into this beer die to the malt bill but even this young I think this might be one of my favorite home brewed beers to date. 

If I brew this again I’ll most likely add a touch a Munich malt and I’d probably use whole leaf hops.

The gauge reads 0 and only a very low fizz is heard when I depress the pin in the cornelius ball lock that is attached to the regulator. Nothing happens even if i screw the regulator screw all the way clockwise. Has anyone dealt with something like this? Can it be fixed or should I look for a new regulator?

"What's the easiest way to supplement Zinc? As per https://www.brunwater.com/articles/zinc-and-ro-water RO water requires some type of minor Zinc supplementation. However, I'm not that happy with the options provided. I think using Yeast nutrient is probably mostly wasteful, and I like avoiding adding anything to my beer that I don't have to. I've read elsewhere a penny will provide enough, or even just a copper immersion chiller. But nothing super definitive.

"Bottle bomb to flat beer Hello everybody !

&amp;#x200B;

I am facing a problem I have a lot of trouble explaining.

A couple of month ago I brewed a beer that got infected with saison yeast which ended in bottle bombs.

Yesterday I openend one of them and they were completly flat, no more gaz. They were stock in a cold place (\~ 8°C average) for one month.

"Refractometer issue Ok, this has got me stumped and has had me stumped for years.  I've always taken refractometer  readings ever since I got one like 10 years ago, it's a Milwaukee MR32ATC from Morebeer (I think).  Usually, I use the refractometer pre-fermentation, and hydrometer post-fermentation... but I didn't bring the latter to my temporary location.

Anywho, I keep having  issues with my numbers.  Like, they're not consistent.  I religiously  have pre-boil readings that are higher than post-boil.  I'll have  pre-boil gravities lower than after boiling and adding 2 pounds of  sugar.  Usually I Papazian it and move on, thinking it would be stratification of the wort or something.

While  brewing today I was getting measurements pre-boil and figured I'd do a little experiment.  If I stired the boil and put drops from the spoon on the refractometer and got 15.25 brix.  If I stir the boil and put drops from a pipette on the refractometer, I  get 12 brix. I repeated this like 5 times with the same results.  The pipette didn't have any water on/in it (might have had residue from the previous sample) and these measurements were taken within seconds of each-other with a rinsed off and towel dried refractometer plate.

After chilling today's wort, the refractometer read 13 brix.

The only think I can think of is the metal spoon evaporating wort in the second it's between wort and refractometer, but that seems bonkers, or keeping the sample exceptionally hot... although, waiting around for a minute didn't change any of the readings.

I have no idea what's going on with this thing, which can put some brews between 7% and 12% abv, and no clear efficiency data.

Any ideas?",Homebrewing
"Fermentation temperature I made a roggenbier (48% rye, 23% pilsner, 20% Munich 10L, 8% Caramunich II, 1% Carafa Special II) and fermented with WB-06 at 60-61 F.

Now, after 21 days at 60-61F and a diacetyl rest of 3 days at 64F, it tastes acid, not quite like green apples, but not quite vinegar neither (so, is it acetaldehyde or acetobacter, I don't know). FG at 1,009 (target was 1,013).

Beersmith states that this yeast should ferment between 59-75 F, but on Fermentis site, it says that, ideally, it should sit between 64-75F (I just notice this). Could it be that this low fermentation temperature (60-61F) created this off flavor? I was thinking letting the beer at 70F (outside the fermentation chamber where a delicious kölsch is coldcrashing) for a week or two. Thoughts?

"First world beer problems - It doesn't get cold enough to make an ice beer I brewed up a 7% ABV brown ale a couple months ago and was planning on making an 'eis-brown'.  The plan was simple:

1. brew a higher abv beer
2. let it ferment to completion
3. rack to a clean keg
4. put the keg outside when it got cold enough to freeze some of the water in the beer
5. rack the unfrozen beer to a serving keg
6. carbonate and enjoy

I got to step 3 just fine and had been watching the weather for the last month, waiting for it to get cold enough at night where i thought it would adequately freeze the beer.

Well, last night the forecasted low was 9'F so I put the keg outside around 2 in the afternoon when it was 34'F.  I let it sit outside from 2pm -&gt; 6am.  It was 10'F when I woke up and thought things went well.  

I shook the keg a little bit and heard icy slush in there.  I proceeded with step 5 from above, hoping it froze enough.  When the transfer was complete, I opened the original keg and saw there was maybe an inch of slush at the bottom.  Definitely not enough to really see any kind of significant abv boost.

The forecast for the foreseeable future has lows only around 30, so I guess I'm going to have to be happy with what I got.

In the future, getting the beer closer to 0'F is probably necessary.  Unfortunately I don't have a freezer large enough to put a keg in there either.",Homebrewing

"Raw/Stone Mashed Nordic Yule Ale w/Middle Brow Brewing. I had the privilege of home brewing a traditional Nordic Yule Ale with some of the guys from Middle Brow Brewing (Chicago). 

We mashed through a bed of straw and juniper in a 10 gallon used barrel with a plugged hole on the bottom. We brought the mash up to temp with hot granite stones. After the mash we drained into a bucket, then added a hop tea made from Saaz &amp; bog myrtle. Transferred back to the barrel once it was rinsed out. We pitched Voss yeast and it’s now open fermenting next to the Såinnhus fires.

"Well I added wine yeast instead of beer yeast and it.... turned out good! Long story short, accidentally added the wine yeast EC-1118, instead of a beer yeast, BE-256, to a belgian ale that I was brewing.   


Realized the next day, and decided to let it brew out and see what happens. OG was 1.040 and FG was 1.025. Underattenuated but tasted really good, not sweet. Would've made a good beer by itself. Approx 2% ABV.   


I decided to increase the ABV so added table sugar(with 40% water and boiled before cooling down) and added it to the beer, along with the BE-256 mixed into the sugar solution bringing it back up to 1.033 Gravity.. I know that wine yeasts are supposed to be yeast killers, so worst case only the table sugar ferments to the wine yeast, or best case the table sugar and the remaining maltotriose ferments from the BE-256.

"Bottle Carbing Woes A bit ago I had some bottle blowing up, so I've reduced my priming sugar to about 6g of dextrose per liter. My current batch of IPA (which I've been thoroughly loving redoing this recipe) had half the bottles carb well and the other half are flatter than a pancake on the motorway and most of those had a too tangy taste. All the bottles were sanitized the same (though I used one instead of regular starsan, but followed starsan procedure. Maybe the problem was here). They all seemed well sealed. The guy who gave me the bottles has a habit of putting his cig butts in them, but they were all washed and scrubbed pretty well.  I stirred in the priming sugar well (but not vigorously).  
The batches were not cold crashed, but I siphoned the beer off the top.

I have an overly-complicated E-HERMS 3 vessel system, mostly hard piped with silicone hose from kettle to pump, hose from mash tun to pump and hose from HERMS exit to mash return. The wort is moved by a Riptide pump.

If I crank it all the way open it doesn't vary. The are no husks/debris in the recirc and the pump never sounds like it's cavitating.

I think my beer spreadsheet is in a place where I'm happy with it. It's not perfect, but it does everything I need and I'm not going to chase perfection. I'm keeping this free to edit as you please, so you can feel free to take it farther if you'd like. I mean hey, it's free!

[Here's the latest desktop version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e34a5JHEoH-6IEPhhK5e0uwKVXyZRqOq/view?usp=sharing). Make sure Macros are enabled if you're going to use them.

Here's why you might be interested in the newest version of the desktop file:

* It computes everything you need for making beer recipes. Also these updates:
* Figured out how to add DME, juice, and sugars correctly.
* Made the style, hop, and fermentable tables editable without crashing everything (including clearing). So now you can change what's there or add your own stuff. Adding hops works but you might want to go into the macro if you want to add a hop *and* have the macro reset it.
* Added AHA styles
* Added every hop BSG sells as of 1-1-19. 
* split decoction into adding back in vs separate boils.
* Fixed so many bugs, and more

[And here's the google sheets version!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1acAVLadS33pLeHeZzQtfmJ5lnQ30tVWNcWtaGlYzF5Y/edit?usp=sharing)

To use the sheets version, go to File-&gt;Make a Copy. 

Now there's a downside of the Google Sheets version, I could never get the beerxml compatibility to work. However:

* You now no longer need excel! Any web browser with HTML5 that can run Google Sheets should be able to run this.
* All the macros are in Tools-&gt;Macros. Skipping between English and Metric? You got it. Clearing and resetting? Sure. They do take longer due to being on the cloud, but it means I can type up a recipe at work and pull it up on my phone later.
* The inputs autofill! No more scrolling on those tiny dropdowns.
* There are the macros GUI\_print and Metric\_GUI\_print. Pressing those will (hopefully) create a pdf of your recipe and it will add it as a new document in your drive. There might be some issues about hidden sheets but idk I just going back to the associated GUI page and trying again and it works.

"The downside of cheapening out A couple of years ago, I purchased a used 14 gallon Bachmann fermentor with the leg extensions.  My environmental chamber is in a different room than my brewlab which means I have to fill it in one room, then get it into my environmental chamber in another.

Looked at the cost of Blichmann casters and there was no way I was going to pay 100 bucks for some steel and casters.  So I went to harbor freight, bought a cheap flat dolly, disassembled it and cut it up then secured the fermentor ( sans extensions) to the dolly.  It worked enough to work but it was pretty much amateur hour ( the dump valve was immediately above the top of the dolly, getting tubing onto the barb was a pain)

For black Friday Blichmann had a 50  percent off accessories sale and I jumped.  Putting on the casters took me 40 min ( 10 min looking for a screw I dropped) and man oh man is this better.
 
I should have done this from the start, but I wanted to cheap it out with ""good enough""

Has anyone had any issues with different inner diameters in their wort flow path for recirc and whirlpooling?  Will a 1.5"" TC valve with a 1.375"" ID cause issues?  Is a 1"" TC valves with 0.875"" going to be noticeably better?  Am I being stupid asking this question?    
I'm already down the tri-clamp fitting rabbit hole.  I know it's expensive and people think it's a waste. Ease of use, cleaning ease and flexibility are my drivers.   I'm also aware that a hose barb isn't technically sterile or CIP ready.  
Basically my outlet from the kettle to the pump will be 3/4"" ID and from the pump to the kettle and to fermenter for re-circ will be 1/2"".  I'll be using 1.5"" TC connectors. 

My current ""flow path"" is:  
1"" OD pickup tube (through a 1.5"" TC opening)-&gt; valve (thinking butterfly) -&gt; 1"" OD (0.85"" ID) TC barb -&gt; 3/4"" ID silicone hose -&gt; 1"" OD (0.85"" ID) TC barb -&gt;  
3/4"" ID in center inlet, chugger pump -&gt; 1/2"" ID  outlet (chugger pump) -&gt;  
Ball-valve (quick clean) -&gt; 5/8"" TC Barb (0.-&gt; 1/2"" ID Silicone tubing -&gt; 5/8"" TC barb -&gt; valve (again thinking butterfly) -&gt; 1"" TC Inlet.    
Previous to buying a new kettle this week I've basically been collecting equipment but not brewing.  I also have a large zchiller that I'll likely put between the ball valve and the pump. on the outlet of the pump",Homebrewing

"Best software for tracking several iSpindels? I've had my Tilt for a couple years and have loved it. But I brew for a house of 6 beer drinkers now, so the one just isn't cutting it anymore. I've decided it's more cost effective to build a few iSpindels to start tracking batches. And the rechargability/18650 battery feature really sold me. I'll think I'll just be switching to using the Tilt on brew day to replace my refractometer/hydrometer readings, I'm not sure I trust the PET plastic in the iSpindels to take readings from hot wort.

Anyway, I still haven't settled on what I'm going to use to track them. My current setup for my Tilt is an old phone constantly logging to a Google Sheet via the Tilt app. This is what I would most like to replicate, although using an old laptop/raspberry pi isn't out of the question.

My goals are:

1. Ideally log to the cloud/Google Sheet. I know how to set up a service accessible outside my home network, but that's less than ideal.

2. Have the data easily accessible/readable later. I keep pretty detailed logs, every brew has a log folder in my Google Drive with the Br'un Water profile, Tilt spreadsheet, and detailed notes I keep via a printed and then scanned checklist. So if something goes wrong I can look back and see what changed. I really like the Google Sheet logging because it can be stored all in one place with the other stuff, and isn't locked into another service like Brewfather or something.

3. Read and log up to 3 devices at a time.",Homebrewing
"Issues with WLP-002 For years, I used 1968 for all of my stouts. Loved how it made for malty beer while floccing out like a champ, as I had no cold crash capabilities. Had read about folks who had issues with this strain floccing so well, that it’d drop out prematurely and leave under-attenuated beers, but I never had that issue. I’d rouse the yeast after 48 hours and all was good. 

Wasn’t able to get 1968 from my LHBS, so I used WLP-002 instead, as I was to understand they are fairly interchangeable. Made a brown ale about 8 weeks back, which started at about 1.050 and stalled out around 1.020. Realized it at packaging, so I just legged and drank shite Newcastle’ish for a few weeks. 

I brewed a stout and just dumped it right onto the yeast cake leftover from the brown ale, and everything fermented out perfectly. Hit all my numbers. Packaged that stout and put another right on top of that yeast cake, and again, everything went perfectly. 

Brewed another brown ale last week, and used a new pack of WLP-002 with a starter. OG at 1.055 and stalled at 1.023. Dumped a dry pack of US-05 in there to see if it’d chew down the rest of those sugars, so fingers crossed.

What are the best alternatives to 1968 / WLP-002? I want something that accentuates the maltiness of my dark beers, but won’t stall out. Also, floculation isn’t nearly as big of a deal, as I have cold crash capabilities now.",Homebrewing

"SS Brewtech Retail Beware I am going to preface this with I do own SSBT equipment, I do like it. However I am also a home brew shop owner that sells SSBT equipment and I feel the way they treat partners is directly related to how it treats customers. 

As everyone saw this past weekend SSBT did a big sale on Chronicals and Electric systems. I have had some customers on the fence about buying SSBT equipment because of the high price tag. When I saw the sale I logged on to the wholesale portal I saw the sale was also applicable to retail outlets. 

I contacted the customers and let them know, about the sale and if they were interested to let me know. A few customers were definitely interested and wanted to get it through me to support a small business. When I tried to place the order the ordering page was locked out.

I contacted retail support, no answer. I contacted them via social media, no answer. I submit a trouble ticket and 1 day later they respond saying &gt;Sales are only available directly through our webstore and are not available direct to retailers at this time. Additionally, we are not accepting any wholesale orders during the event.

Now as a retail outlet, I look at myself as an extension for SSBT, we have limited for space and prioritizing my vendors is fairly important. Sadly at the time of me righting this I have not heard back from SSBT wholesale team, I am also unable to submit orders. 

I am bothered by the lack of response and customer service. It seems SSBT is completely fine with this behavior. I just hope if I have a problem with my equipment they are a little more responsive.

I am going to do an Assassins Creed brew day this Saturday, and i got a recipe out of the game. There are some things i am going to preface this with.  
   
1. I am not using old Barley, I am going to get it milled from my local store and not colourful.

   
2. It does not put a yeast in the recipe, and i assume it's a wild yeast. I am not quite comfortable using a wild quite yet, so i would really appreciate a suggestion on what yeast to use. \*\*This is my biggest hangup\*\*

 Recipe:

 In a cauldron, take last year's barley that's grown some colourful friends, roast it over a low fire until the stink is replaced with the smell of burned syrup.

 Take equal parts new Wheat, soak it in clear ice water for two days, and add to the cauldron with enough water to fill to the top.

 Boil over a hot fire for a morning, strain into a tub and re-boil the grains one more time. 

Add to a cooled broth five apples, a bush of lavender, one medium plant of sage, and a fist sized ball of pine tar.

Cover your tub and forget about your brew for twenty nights. Store in a barrel and keep for cold eves that need a bit of warming.",Homebrewing

I percieved this beer as watery, thin and flavourless and i want to improve it. Primarily wanting to increase maltyness and mouthfeel.

In addition to this i think i will sligthly increase the grainbill to account for the higher fg and increase abv to 3,5%. What do yall think of that? 

In addition to that i have heard that toasted oats are good for increasing malty biscuity flavours, do you have any experience with this and what % of grainbill would you use? I might also increase the black patent for more roasty flavours but i am afraid of acrid contributions.

I am having trouble balancing my kegline and am quite confused. Please redirect me if there is a better sub.

Anyway, I have pretty standard IPA that I want to serve with decent carbonation, but nothing crazy. I'm aiming for roughly 14 psi, which, ok, is on the high side.

I'm serving with a picnic tap, so about a foot above the keg.

I had been using a 10 foot line of 3/16"" line, nothing fancy (though I bought it a long time ago). I find the beer very foamy in the glass. I can get it to a decent place if I raise my hands up over my head, absorbing some of the pressure.

When I do the calculations, they say I should be using 4.16 feet of tubing. That seems like it will have way too little resistance and cause even more foam.

I get
LENGTH = (KEG PRESSURE -1 -(HEIGHT/2))/RESISTANCE
L= (14 - 1 -.5)/3
L= 12.5/3

when i brewed this I had no idea how to handle fruit, so there was very limited raspberry taste to beginn with.

giving the brett more than a year to do its thing yielded a beer that is slightly sour, fruity without tasting of any one fruit and very funky from the brett.

I love it!",Homebrewing

"Keg to Keg Transfer with Spunding Guage/Valve I did search the archives first.  Apologies if I missed it.  OK so I have done a few keg to keg transfers just using a valve on the recieveing kegs gas port buried in liquid.  I'm nervous about having the right back pressure, but I feel it is tough to dial it in blindly just using a valve.  So I purchaed a bowtie spunding gauge/valve, and I humbly have a couple of questions.  So my setup is pretty standard.  Using two Sanke Kegs.  I do transfers from 1/4 slims to logs so Ican fit the log into my kegerator.  I have a standard fridge where I store the 1/4 until ready to use.    I set up the transfer with 15lbs in in the sending and recieving kegs.  Standard Sanke coupler and lines on sending keg.  Beer line out on the sending keg to beer line port on the receiving keg.  Sanke couple on receiving keg with valves removed.  Gas port on receiving keg has a gas line to valve on the end buried in liquid during the transfer.  I plan on inserting the spunding gauge/valve on that gas line.  First question is what are others using for pressue for these type of transfers, and what is a good differential in pressure to maintain beween sending and receivng kegs?

"Liqueur Crafting: Difference between Grain Alcohol (90°~) and Spirits (Vodka/Brandy/Rum/etc) for Maceration?    Pretty much the title. Grain Alcohol usually has a higher alcohol proportion, so I can only assume it's a better solvent, therefore it would be better for maceration of fruits and herbs, as it would extract more flavors and aromatics more easily and quickly. Also, it would be easier to control the alcohol content in the final Liqueur.

   So, is there any reason for using less-concentrated spirits for maceration and general liqueur-making?

"Tips for increasing extraction efficiency? I used to hover around 50%, according to Brewhouse's calculations. 

Today I used 5.3kg Munich malt, with 250 grams caramunich and 200 grams oat flakes with 20 liters of water at a ph of 7.3. 

Added them at 35 degrees C, and increased to 69 degrees at a speed of a bout 2 degrees per minute. 

Immediately after adding the grains, ph lowered to 5.8.

I added 2ml of phosphoric acid as I thought my ph wouldn't be acidic enough and my ph at 69 degrees was 5.10, a bit lower than I hoped. (next time I'll add less acid) I mashed at 69C for 60 minutes. 

Pre-boil gravity, corrected to 20degrees C, was 1.036. Just a bit better than last time I did the exact same recipe. Only this time I tried to respect mashing steps and kept an eye on water chemistry and ph.

My take on Troeg’s First Cut. Doing two, one-hour BRIAB sessions for better attenuation. Aiming for at least 6.2% ABV and 45 IBU, but not opposed to a higher abv percent. 

**WHAT I KNOW ABOUT FIRST CUT:**

\- Uses Crystal, Pilsner and Munich malts

\- Official site claims that it uses just comet and simcoe hops, but past promotional material mentions mosaic as well. 

\- Some Untappd entries for the scratch version of it mention only simcoe in secondary. Would I only use simcoe in secondary and just comet for boil and whirlpool? Maybe.

\- Mangoes used at some point. Probably a secondary edition (5 pounds a good starting point with dryhops?)

"Free Science Oppurtunity [SuperYeast Poster](https://imgur.com/a/m8d80Z1)

Hello!  
I am posting on behalf of the MeMBrane research group at Aston University.  
We are currently running a free citizen science project, and need your help!  
We are improving yeast strains for production of alcohol and biofuels, by increasing their tolerance to alcohol and sugar.  
Firstly, we need to identify tolerant strains. You can send us a sample of your yeast through our free swab system, and have your yeast tested for alcohol and sugar tolerance.   
You will be able to see how effective your yeast is, and there will be a leaderboard on our website (the winner takes a prize!).

"Cleaning and sanitzing - my (failed) brews so far Sooo... this is what I brewed so far

In pot on stove, 1 gal glass jug:- Helles beginner package (malted grain), cleaned equipment with included Oxi Clean -&gt; clumsy at bottling, way too much yeast in bottles. Mostly gushers

\- IPA beginner package (Brooklyn BrewShop), cleaned equipment with Oxi Clean , cold crashed for a day -&gt; mostly OK, few gushers

Klarstein Brauheld Pro 35 liter, plastic fermentation buckets:

\- Milkshake IPA with fruit and dry hop additions to primary, cleaned equipment with Oxi Clean -&gt; beer tasted disgusting after bottle conditioning (sour, off flavour). Had to dump them all, not sure if lack of sanitizing (i thought oxi = star san) , the (pasteurized) passion fruit addition or contaminated hop sock was the issue. Lesson learned

\-  Dry hopped cider made from fresh, pasteurized apple juice, cleaned equipment with Oxi Clean -&gt; came out very vinegar-y and not tasty

Went to the shop and bought 2 nc kegs:

\- Belgian Tripel, cleaned equipment with Oxi Clean -&gt; Beer very sour, gross when taking gravity readings, got better every week. Is now in keg for 3 weeks, tastes better but still has an unpleasant smell to it

Went to the shop and bought me some star san

\- Apple cider from cheap ass juice, cleaned everything with oxi &amp; star san -&gt; came out delicious! backsweetend with table sugar, force carbed and put in fridge. Very tasty, friends loved it

\- ""no bullshit"" IPA, just 2-row and hops that I still had,  cleaned everything with oxi &amp; star san -&gt; beer is almost ready to keg. Fingers crossed

Do you guys think that the lack of star san caused the fatalities?   
Do you think it's worth to keep the Tripel in the keg and give it a few more weeks? Or is the unpleasant smell an indication for an infection?

"Belgian dubbel has hit FG.. When to bottle &amp; ABV questions Okay, I know the obvious answer is ""if it's finished, it's good to go""..... but is it?

Firstly, the yeast attenuated more than I had expected, giving me a 9% ABV beer rather than 8% (which is already quite high for a dubbel). In taking various measurements through hydrometers and refractometers and plugging them into the Northern Brewer website, I get [three different answers](https://imgur.com/a/fCMsvIq) for possible ABV. Interestingly, 1.016 was my target FG, but I trust the hydrometer more (yes, they're all calibrated correctly). But should I be paying attention to any of the other outputs?

The beer smells gorgeous. I've just finished a dry week, so I'm sipping the sample I took for the hydrometer very slowly. I get some nice flavours from it (peppery/spicy, slight floral, some dark fruit &amp; bready), but I do wonder if it could be rounded out more and if a dubbel would benefit from longer in the fermenter? It's only been 10 days so far. Or do I want to bottle it ASAP to keep most of the yeast, as the yeast form an important part of such a style, rather than letting them settle at the bottom. The alcohol burn is also real on this beer, I've never understood it when people mentioned it before, but this is.. Wow. It isn't hidden. So, again, would letting it sit for a little bit longer (I won't bottle until Sat/Sun earliest anyway, taking me to the 2 week mark). 

Due to the cold temperatures here in the UK, I now have the capability to cold crash in our conservatory. Is this something that would be recommended, or should I skip this because I want the yeast in the beer (though I appreciate cold crashing doesn't get rid of all the yeast).

Cutting corners recently I stopped the chilling at 120-130f and transfer to the fermenter since it was metal. I would splash it as.much as possible to oxygenate it for fermentation. let it cool over night and add the yeast in the morning.

Well I would ferment as usual. Dry hop. And then keg hop. Time and time again I would get an oxidized piece of garbage. Wet cardboard. Harsh sherry. Cloudy beer.

"Help name my (probably unsuccessful) first ever homebrew, an introduction So, ever since craft beer started to blow up here in Alberta and my latent alcoholism could be easily spun as a cool new hobby, I’ve had making my own rattling around the back of my head. Well, on Friday I finally pulled the trigger and made a pit stop after my weekly grocery trip to pick up some gear for brewing. 


Turns out the only shop within 150km in any direction of me is more interested in selling extract kits than they are in helping a complete newbie build even the most basic of brew-in-a-bag setups for all-grain brewing. So I bought the things I thought I needed, including unmilled grains, hops, and yeast. 


And because I didn’t research any recipes before I bought grains, it turns out I had about half the base malt I needed and a whole bunch of other malts that I need in much smaller quantities than the 1kg bags they came in. Undeterred I decided to roll with it and see what comes out. And considering I’ve never done anything like this before in my life (aside from some lactofermented hot sauces, and one try at a sourdough starter a few years ago that I binned when it started to smell like blue cheese) I’m not expecting anything out of my first round aside from learning the process. 


And here’s where I need help. My beer needs a name. For good luck. Because if it has a name, it’ll be more likely to succeed. Or I’ll be more likely to drink it. One or the other. 


This was my process and ingredients for an 11L batch:

Grains: 

- Munich: 1kg
- Crystal 40: 500g
- Briess Carapils: 500g
^(all of the above was “milled” with a food processor because the brewing store doesn’t stock grain mills nor do they do any milling on site. 10/10 would not recommend. also, I saved my 2-row for the next brew, which was apparently the only proper base malt I bought. if this one’s gonna be a fuckup, at least round 2 will have *some* sort of proper ingredients.)


Hops:

- Centennial: 15g for 90min
- Fuggle: 15g for 30min
- Saaz/Fuggle 15g each for 5min post-boil


Strike water was 10L at 72C, for a mash temp of 67C for an hour. I sparged with 4L at 76C, then boiled for 90min, at 97C (boiling temp at my elevation). 


Specific gravity was 1.033, original gravity was 1.041 (I took gravity readings for the wort pre-and-post boil, am I doing that right?). I cooled my wort outside in a snow bank because the brewing store didn’t have a wort chiller and they didn’t know what I was talking about when I described it to them. I have one being shipped right now. It took 70 minutes to get from 90C to 22C. Does this matter? I don’t know. 


I pitched the yeast 26 hours ago, Saflager S-23, and it’s sitting in the primary fermenter right now at a steady 18C. Secondary fermentation will happen in my cold room that keeps a steady 11C. 


So, here we are, 26 hours in, and my beer is bubbling away. Now that I know I didn’t kill the yeast and that my half-baked attempt at brewing is going to produce *something*, I’m curious about three things:


1. What do I call it?
2. Guesses on flavour profile for my abomination?
3. How soon is too soon to start another?


Anyway, really excited to get this journey going and really glad that there’s a handful of breweries nearby so when this inevitably turns out to be nigh-on undrinkable I can just go fill up a few growlers and have something that I don’t need to just choke down.",Homebrewing

"Brett primary spoilage (Perry) I had about 10kg of pears and some White labs Brett that needed to be used, so I blended up the pears in a sanitized food processor dumped them into a sanitized 30l bucket, popped the top and airlock on and let it bubble for about a week. 

This was a very young Perry (probably should have gone three weeks) but I wanted to follow the progress, so decided to put it through the cider press after about a week or so. 

When I opened the top there were three tiny spots of white (mold?) on the floating pomme mash. I skimmed    5mm of the mash off the top with a clean spoon and discarded it. I saw no other growth so I assumed that whatever it was hadn’t penetrated the surface. 

I pressed the whole thing through a cheese cloth and into capped bottles. 


It was much closer to juice than Perry, barely alcoholic and very sweet, but the flavor was phenomenal: like racehorse sweat if racehorses sweat emoticons and jolly ranchers. 

Had half the batch over the next week. 

Now it looks like there may be some little white flecks growing on the surface of the remaining bottles. It’s too soon to know if it’s Kham’s yeast or mold, but, nonetheless, somethings there that shouldn’t be, which leads me to my question:

When using brettanomyces as the primary yeast, how do you minimize spoilage microbes? I assume in my case that the yeast didn’t raise CO2 or ethanol content fast enough (or that it didn’t drop the ph in the pomme mash; guess I should have stirred?).

"2021 NHC Update I’m excited to share some news with you about the 2021 National Homebrew Competition: It’s happening!It broke our hearts when we had to cancel the 2020 competition just as it was set to get underway. Not having that annual tradition for our hundreds of dedicated judges and volunteers and our thousands of entrants left a hole in the spring and summer.But you know that saying about lemons and lemonade? Well, we took homebrew competition entries for a canceled competition and made hand sanitizer for essential workers. Since then, we’ve learned a few things. First, hand sanitizer is great, but nothing beats a homebrew. Second, we never want to cancel NHC again.With uncertainty forecasted for 2021, we are doing everything we can to ensure NHC happens. After all, if you’re like us, you’ve probably been brewing more than ever. And the judges in your quarantine bubble might be suffering from palate fatigue.We will bring you the best NHC ever. Here’s how we plan to do that.

In 2021, all NHC entries will be judged from our refrigerated warehouse in Colorado.

This September, many of us at the AHA helped execute the safe judging of more than 9,000 entries at the Great American Beer Festival® with no COVID transmission. We will be applying what we learned to run the NHC using the Great American Beer Festival competition model.

We want to get you the best experience ever, so we’ll be partnering with Great American Beer Festival judges and BJCP certified judges to execute the competition.

We typically judge about 1,300 entries for the NHC final round. This year, we’ll be ready to evaluate upwards of 5,000 entries.

In order to make this event possible, we will be increasing the entry fee to $29 per entry. The increase will allow us to conduct all of the judging in one place and to take necessary health and safety precautions.We understand that 2020 has been a challenging year for many. One silver lining is that many of us have had the chance brew a few more batches, and maybe even share a few beers with friends. Our community is important to us, and ensuring the competition happens in 2021 is an important part of building that community.

"Hey, water chemistry matters Just sharing a story about my experience with water chemistry. Maybe some people will have a better day knowing that all of us can struggle from time to time, others might be able to benefit from my learning experience. 

So, I've been brewing for a while. Probably about a decade at this point. I'd gone through all the phases, and my most recent one was doing BIAB, fermenting in 5 gallon corny kegs, and serving in 3 gallons. It was a sweet time. I was travelling a lot, and this setup was able to go anywhere I did. Quite literally, I brought it on a plane to Italy when I was living there. At any rate, I settled down, bought a house, and somehow ended up with a local brewery's pilot system. I had been using RO water and chemistry adjustments for a while. But with this new system, I was making more beer, and my two 5 gallon water jugs didn't quite get me all the water I needed. 

For most batches, I was needing 11 to 12 gallons of water. So, I would get 10 gallons of RO at the grocery store and top off with 1 gallon of well water. Well, all of the initial batches of my new, expensive system sucked. Like, bad beer, man. All beers had this awful, lingering bitterness that was not hops. I blew 3 or 4 batches of just barely drinkable, bitter crap. It was pretty upsetting; I had gone from making pretty decent beer on a very basic setup, to making very bad beer on a complicated setup that I splurged on. I was willing to try anything, and, on a Hail Mary, I bought a small RO system for the house, so I could always have as much RO as I wanted. Without that 1-2 gallon top off, my beer was back to normal. 

The TLDR/conclusion here is that just 10% of your water being not up to brewing standards can really get you. I encourage anyone getting into brewing to go with RO as not to be potentially discouraged. I've run out of brewing salts before, and straight RO water makes fine beer (there are exceptions, of course). It'll be better than what I was putting out with a ratio of 10:1 RO to tap, anyway.",Homebrewing

"Water build up Hey all,

I am working on brewing a pacific coast ipa today, my last two extract brews I developed recipes for using distilled water with 2 oz each of sodium chloride and gypsum (recommendation from another reddit user). I wasn't overly impressed with the results though I think there were many issues water aside. My question is does this water make up seem okay or should I just get some store bought spring water?

"Cider with M29 french saison So i got hold of 14l  cheap fresh pressed juice and all i have for the moment is mangrove jack french saison (and all my airlocks and F2 carboys are used for the moment :) ).

Wondering at what temperature it is best to ferment this.  I can do  +-25°C (maybe more with a blanket around it+ its own ferment temp rise),  21°C and +-16°C.

I know the french saison works best with higher temperatures and gives more flavour. But i don't know if it's beneficial for the cider to ferment at 25+ degrees. Haven't used the M29 before (smells like cheese with dried herbs).",Homebrewing

"Mash water volume (water/grain ratio) - new all grain brewer missing the mark. Recently upgraded my hot side to a fancy single vessel set up from Spike. I was using a large pot on the stove. I would mash in with just 3 gallons and at the end - after the boil and transfer to the fermenter - I would add cold water to bring the volume up to target and lower temperature. 

On the new single vessel, I can fit all of the water (including predicted losses) with all of the grain into the kettle.

This obviously shifts the grain water ratio - and I’m left wondering if this has unintended changes to the mash. 

This last beer I brewed was my first all grain batch, and on the new kettle. Like any good scientist I decided to change multiple variables. 

7.78 gal water
11.4lbs of grain (only milled once).

I did a step mash
122 15 min
145  30 min
158 30 min

I did a vorlaugh for 20 minutes
Did a whirlpool and transfer.

Checked my starting gravity....and only 1.021
I entered crisis mitigation mode and added DME to raise the gravity to my target 1.049


-first all gain batch (been brewing hybrid batches 50/50)
-first step mash ( I’ve been doing a single infusion)
-first run on the new kettle
-first time having target volume in kettle with grain

I’m looking for help and a general discussion on what people have found helps with efficiency. I’m going to check the kettle temp with a calibrated thermometer to ensure the temperature accuracy. I almost wonder if I need to add a temp probe to the grain basket to see the difference in temperature measured by the element to the water temp coming out of the pump into the basket. 

I wonder if I need to adjust the mill - or simply mill twice. 

I didn’t check mash PH before adding grain or through out process - I added that to my check list.

Anyone have some systematic approaches or ideas to improve my processes and overall brewing?",Homebrewing
"Evaporative cooling Just wanted to share my recent success at cooling my homebrew. We've just begun to hit summer in Australia and two 40°c days timed very poorly with my fermentation.

"A week on I'm finally ready to share the mishaps from my 1st all grain brew day It has been a week since I used my new BrewZilla to make my first ever all-grain brew, and it’s taken me that long to own up to how it went, but I’ve decided to share my toils with you, for your entertainment and to reinforce my lessons learned. 

So the batch I wanted to do was called 'War Priest', taken from Acquisitions Intoxicated, who designed the recipe on their Twitch stream, and based it on one of the characters from the D&amp;D game. The layers of nerding out going on here is something I can’t go past, and would highly recommend [Acquisitions Intoxicated](https://youtu.be/7v_dJC0AKD8), along with the forbearer D&amp;D game [Acquisitions Incorporated](https://youtu.be/j_fGKY44DaI), to anyone willing to give it a whirl. 

War Priest a **big** beer - a Black IPA aiming at over 8% ABV and 80 IBU. Here's [my Brewfather recipe](https://share.brewfather.app/xuXq2xoiGUUCjF) for it (slightly tweaked from what I actually did for that batch, but not hugely...yet)  

I was (stupidly) aiming for a 23L ferment, which from everything I read about the BrewZilla was near the limits of the grain bill size the 35L vessel will take, but not over it... So fuck it, I went with that rather than scaling down a few litres... because what's the worst that could happen? 

A few notes before I regale you with tails of my woes: 

* I decided to use a BIAB bag underneath the malt pipe for extra filtration, based on the setups from others that I’ve seen online 
* I ordered the grain bill double milled (ie for BIAB) 
* I did not use rice hulls
* the ""[Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Mash Paddle](https://www.kegland.com.au/stainless-steel-mash-paddle-heavy-duty.html)"" from Kegland might be appropriately sized for the 65L version, or for an oversized stock pot feeding the entire crew of an aircraft carrier, but in the 35L BrewZilla it is comically large, almost unusable (learn from me and ignore that piece of advice - stick with a normal sized one!)

Last weekend I finally got time for a brew day, after sitting on the grains and my brand new BrewZilla for over a week. I had tested bringing water up to a boil, and using the immersion chiller, so that I would be comfortable with the process. 

I had also built the recipe into Brewfather, which gave me all sort of information about the process which seemed incredibly helpful. In hindsight, however, I didn’t know some of the intricacies of the tool, including the Equipment settings and volume limits... What resulted was me having to remove about 4L of mash water to add to the sparge before putting the grains in because I knew it wouldn't fit otherwise. That amount was pretty much perfect, with the BrewZilla tapped out in terms of capacity, and the density of the mash being unpleasant to stir.... (particularly with the 10 tonne mash paddle that couldn't fit sideways in the malt pipe around the middle tube....)

But mash went reasonably, and the colour and smell was perfect, so I'm feeling okay at this stage. So I move onto sparging, using every ounce of strength to be able to pull the malt pipe out of the wort and twist it onto the little ledge thing to drain.

Based on my lack of rice hulls, the ultra fine milling of the grains, and probably the fact that I forgot to recirculate the wort through the mash process, the sparge kept getting stuck. Queue montage of me in my laundry/garage, standing over the BrewZilla, which was propped up on a chair to get better air flow, with the malt pipe resting on top, using the worlds larges mash paddle to gentle try to help the sparging process along... I manage to get almost the whole way through this, having put in all of the sparge water (and extra taken out pre mash), only to make the fatal mistake of not paying enough attention to where the malt pipe 'feet' were on the rails at the top of the kettle. When stirring the incredibly thick grist I must have twisted the malt pipe too much, because malt pipe plus 8.25kg of grain and whatever water weight it had picked up come crashing down back into the wort, splashing about 4L of wort over me, the walls, the washer/dryer, and the whole garage....

From there I was able to pretty quickly pull the malt pipe back out, hose myself down, and start the long process of cleaning the garage thoroughly to remove (what I hope is) all of the sugary, sticky wort that flooded it, but at the end of the process the BrewZilla wasn't having a bar of it, and refused to turn on the heating elements. It took a solid 4 hours of it drying off before I had any luck getting it going again. 4 hours during which I was beating myself up for breaking my brand new brewing tool that I’d bought as a graduation present for myself, in the first day out of the box! 

But thankfully, after that I was able to complete the brew days otherwise uneventfully. The final product was about 19L of wort in the fermenter that has been bubbling away all week, and I expect will be ready to keg this weekend, at which point I'm planning to brew a [Witbier](https://share.brewfather.app/0BWxkjE21wGRPs), learning from many of the mistakes from last time...

I hope me owning up to this helps someone avoid a similar fate, or at least makes a few of you laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR – very full malt pipe fell back into the wort at the end of the sparge, sending several litres of hot, sugary mess all over me, my laundry/garage, and my brand new BrewZilla. Thankfully, after a few hours of drying out, the BrewZilla started working again, and I was able to complete a slightly smaller batch in the end.",Homebrewing
"Using instant oats for body/mouthfeel with extract brewing? I'm doing a bit of experimenting this weekend. Specifically I'm making a high gravity 12% hoppy saison using some saison yeast with near 100% attention.

"Hop palette fatigue? So this is a little bit outside of the normal technical and process questions that others and myself usually ask here. For a few years now I’ve been chasing the mythical perfect New England IPA. I have become a much better brewer in that time and have refined my processes all over the place from cold side oxidation to water chemistry. There’s one thing that I feel is constantly screwing me up... I don’t think I like any of the beers that I make. 

My friends and family enjoy them, but I am kind of ambivalent to them. They’re never able to live up to what I want them to be. Maybe it’s because I have been lucky to have been able to try some of the worlds “best” IPAs and drink pretty much nothing but very hopped up, and most of the time hazy style beers from professionals. I love various beer styles, but I am absolutely a hop head. So my question is… Am I just not able to taste and smell what others think is really good? Over this Thanksgiving break, I gave my parents and sister samples of my beer and samples of another beer that I really enjoy. I didn’t tell him which one is which. All of them picked my beer. 

The point is I think I have possibly overloaded my palate with extremely hoppy and very well-made hoppy beers. Is this what I’ve heard called hop fatigue? Is that a thing? What do I do to get back to objectively tasting and smelling all the hard work I put into my beers?

Bready and complex with figs and pepper. Fairly dry and refreshing. Effervescent and slightly prickly with alcohol warmth and a medium-light body. Rocky, tan head dissipates after about a minute.

During aging, it lost a little heat and gained a little dried fruit, as well as the flavor becoming more prominent and less muddy.

"Scottish Wee heavy problems Hello All,

I brewed a Scottish wee heavy and it was a problem from the start. This was my first high gravity extract beer and a few lessons were learnt , anyhow , after 3 weeks of fermenting , it’s finally stopped . OG was a massive 1.113 , and it’s now at 1.065. I reckon the Yeast has finally run out of gas. I had yeast problems initially. 

Anyway, I am going to assume 1.065 is still way to high , however , I did squeeze and rinse the hell out of the steeping bags. Is it possible the current high gravity is due to the large amount of unfermentable sugars from my excessive squeezing every last drop out of the special malts ?

The FU happened when I was pitching the yeast in. I had two jars of yeast in my fridge, and as I am simple person with memory capacity of a bee, I didn't mark the jars for what they contain. Another one was WhiteLabs Vermont Ale, that I used in previous batch and another one was  WhiteLabs German Lager that I used for pilsner. So when it was time to take the yeast out of the fridge, without hesitation I took the jar that I thought was the Vermont Ale yeast and proceeded with that. Next day it just suddenly crossed my mind that I must have taken the wrong yeast. The one that I took was in such a pickle jar that we hadn't ever bought home. I fermented the pilsner at my parents cellar as it has constant temperature of 13C, so pretty okay for pilsner, right. So now I have beer, that was supposed to be sort of a NEIPA fermenting with German lager yeast at 20C. 

The question is, what kind of outcome you would expect of this batch with lager yeast that is fermenting way above its optimal temperature range? Also the last batch had fermented just in time for trip to summer cottage, so I did not have time to dry hop it before it was all gone. Do you think the amount of hops is decent for the beer style? Is there other modifications to this recipe that would make it more like the style it is poorly trying to mimic?

"Need advice for fermenting vessel So i've gone from an ordinary plastic bucket to a fermzilla, but i've had to many problems with the fermzilla and now it's broken. It's leaking from the valve part and I cant seem to find that as spare part anywhere so it time to buy something new.

What im looking for is a vessel that can do oxygenfree transfering, pressure fermenting is a plus but not needed. I dont really care about if it's plastic or steel and I have a high budget range.

"My Imperial Stout never carbonated Hello to everyone,

  
I have made an imperial stout 9.5% abv that was on primary fermentation for 8 days and then on secondary for 14 days. After that, I bottled and I primed with dextrose so as to have 2.0 CO2. Well, after 20 days there is no sign of carbonation and the temperature is 20C, I have never faced something similar even when I had used gelatin. I suppose that all the yeast cells had settled down and none went into the bottles. So I was thinking if it is possible to open all the bottles, put some yeast that I recently harvested (Lallemand Verdant IPA yeast) and put other caps on and wait for it to carbonate (I used Lallemand Lalbrew Nottingham yeast for the main fermentation). I know that it has a lot of steps that I could contaminate my beer, but still has anyone tried that? Or generally has anything better to propose?

cider doesn't taste like alcohol? I have been fermenting cider in 3 1-gallon containers with regular airlocks.

"Determining off-taste in blue moon clone Hey all,

I made this popular [blue moon clone](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/blue-balls-belgian-wit-blue-moon-clone.24978/) last month. Just kegged it on Monday and had my first sips today and it's the first beer since all grain that I've been really disappointed with, and may have to dump. So I figured I'd try to get to the bottom of it here. There is just this extremely bitter and tangy taste, hardly tastes like beer. The only thing I can think of is that there was too much orange peel OR because I didn't put the orange peel into a muslin bag, instead I just dumped into the kettle and let the carboys sit for about a month? Recipe below...

I made it into an 8.6gal batch (I always do around 9 gal batches because anything more and when I BIAB the grain overflows out of my 15gal kettle) and scaled with beersmith. Recipe as follows:

6lbs 14.4oz flaked wheat

10 lbs 2 row

1.9 oz Willamette

1.29oz Coriander

1.29oz Orange peel, bitter

OG - 1.044, FG - 1.005 (my refractometer was acting up so not 100% accurate on the FG... I need a tilt)

There are 3 slight deviations from the original recipe. The first is the scaling to a bigger batch. Second thing you will notice is my ratio of wheat and 2row is off. I noticed last minute I didn't have enough flaked wheat so I said screw it and just increased the amount of 2 row. 3rd thing is I used Willamette as a sub for Goldings.

Lastly, this is the first batch that I started with RO water and made my own mineral profile, so I could have done this horribly wrong.

Overall, I think it has something to do with the orange peel. Maybe orange peel doesn't scale well in beersmith when increasing batch size? Or maybe the orange peel doesn't work as well with less flaked wheat? Maybe my water profile was off and made it extremely bitter/tangy?

Any suggestions at all, please share!",Homebrewing
"Help with my kegging woes My last two kegging experiences left me with some foamy pours and some skunky/cardboard flavours. The foam I am sure is from over-pressurizing. But the off flavours has me thinking oxygen is destroying my beer!

What I've been doing: auto-siphon from carboy to keg, then purge with co2 a few times, set it at serving psi (I try going lower, around 6-10 b/c I am using a 2.6 gallon keg with a small regulator and Sodastream canister) and leave it for the week. 

Comes out pretty foamy but settles and is carbed ok. But boy, the taste! So skunky. When I tasted from the fermenter prior to kegging it was delicious and on point. What am I doing wrong here? Should I be doing closed transfers? I have seen enough videos out there that my process theoretically works and that others have success.

If I were to perform a closed transfer what would I need to get going? Just a double spout? Also, where do I hook up my gas line/bev line in this case? Feeling very overwhelmed kegging, any help/tips would be very much appreciated!",Homebrewing

"So I think I've got a persistent infection My brews seem to turn out acidic after a while in the bottle. 2 weeks in the bottle, they're great, and then suddenly one day they taste pretty lousy. It's a pretty noticeable flavour, I wouldn't say it's funky but acidic for sure. However, the brews are not overattenuated - the gravity remains unchanged.

Nothing worked, couldn’t lauter this mash. Had to dump the mash. Stick cranked out the next batch though even when wanting to call it.

"Question about a first time brew This is my first homebrew project so I went for an all-grain american ipa style beer as my first brew (I drink these a lot so I thought I'd be able to tell if it came out well more easily) and I have a couple fo questions regarding it.

1. It appears to have stopped fermenting as there is no activity in the fermenter that I can see anymore even though I'm just under 2 weeks in to the ferment - I felt when I started that I underpitched the yeast so I thought think may have been a cause?
2. I've checked the gravity and it had a gravity of 1.060 when I started the ferment and it now has 1.028 - is that a normal level at this point in the ferment?
3. I tasted a small amount when I checked the gravity and it has quite an alcoholic flavour despite it being only 4.20% (assuming my gravity reading is accurate) I've done some research and I think it may be due to fermenting it at too high a temperature - is there a way to reduce this in the final beer?

"Can/should I add more yeast if I screwed up hydrating my dry yeast? Hey, definite noob here, but want to see if anyone has some advice for me in my situation. First time brewing in almost a decade.

Used an extract kit ([Brewer's Best, Imperial Nut Brown](http://brewersbestkits.com/assets/1048_imperialnutbrown_recipe.pdf)) today, and everything went swimmingly during my boil, I cooled my wort down fast with an immersion chiller, and decided to try rehydrating my yeast packet ([this one](https://kamiljuices.com/products/windsoraleyeast)). For some reason, though I knew to warm up the water beforehand, I neglected to do so (used cold brita water). The yeast didn't bubble up at all in the starter glass, and I'm not sure how much action it's had since adding it to the fermenter. I figure I probably killed off a bunch of the yeast by putting it dry into cold water.

I'm curious if it's worth trying/possible at this point to get another packet at my local homebrew shop tomorrow morning and adding that to the fermenter (and starting it correctly this time), or if it's not possible/not worth it at this point (finished brewing about 4 hours ago).

Fermentation finished up in about 7 days (3 Gallon batch). I moved it to secondary to lager for 3 weeks.

"Correction for too much finishing hops? This is mostly for future reference, I don't know that I need or want to do anything the fix the current batch. Anyway, I was nearing the end of my boil and letting my mind fly ahead to think about chilling and pitching and I just abent-mindedly added the entire 1 oz bag of finishing hops (Fuggles) to my porter. It was only supposed to be 0.5 oz. 

I figured that wasn't going to be deal-breaker, so I finished the last 15 minutes of boil. The wort was bitter, but not intolerable. 

I'm assuming that if the beer is too floral, I can condition it a bit longer and that will fade. I also assume I'm stuck with extra bitterness, which may turn out to be a happy accident, who knows? If this were to happen again, is there a way to intervene? Aggressively filter out the hops? Stop the boil? Ooh - I guess I should start using a hop bag. Is there any way to correct for too much bitterness after the boil?",Homebrewing

"Dubbel Grists - is simplicity best? ""or simply easiest?"" Thanks, Depeche Mode, I needed another earworm. 

Anyway. I tried asking in the weekly recipe thread, but that thing sees so little attention that I'm pulling this part out for more scrutiny. I have pretty solid luck with light coloured Belgians, I'm very happy with my various IPAs, tripels, (low EBC) saisons, and the like. However with the singular exception of a chocolate quad I am not happy with my darker styles. 

This is what I was thinking for a more complicated grist version of the beer. Lyle's is invert sugar syrup and is about 10 EBC, so not beet sugar, but most non-syrup candi sugars aren't either.

"Biscoff lemon cheesecake(?) Sour Thought i would share my first original recipe which i have put on this weekend.

Started out as a straight lemon sour made from a post i found on reddit to test souring out. 4.5kg marris otter mashed then soured using sourpitch and kept at 32 degrees using a fishtank heater until ph hit 3.1 before boiling, lemon peel @ 10 mins and fermented out with us 05.

Trial went well but it was very straight, sharp and sour. Wanted to add more of a dessert feel to it so i have added 250g of biscuit malt and 500g of biscoff biscuits to the mash along with 250g of toasted oats for a creamy mouthfeel.  Soured to 3.1 again and boiled for 60 min.

Hopped with 25g of cascade and simcoe and 50g of citra, 1/3 of these at 10 mins remaining along with lemon peels and 1/2 whirlfloc.

Will dry hop in secondary with the remaining 2/3 of hops and 500g of lactose to add to creaminess and give a base of unfermentable sweetness along with more lemon peels.

Smelled great going into the fermenter, i find sours take a while for fermentation to start but hopefully this will kick off later today.

Looking forward to seeing how this goes, might try a sour stout if this goes well!",Homebrewing

"An experiment by mistake So about a month ago my wife ordered my a 3 liter flask to use in brewing, the seller shipped her a case of 6 of them by accident. I tried to return the 5 extra but they said to just keep them. I then had the problem if what to do with 18 liters worth of flasks, then I had an idea.

 I brewed a beer and split the batch into 6 two liter parts in each of the flasks. I then pitched 6 different yeasts to ferment in the flasks. I let them ferment out, bottled and conditioned the brews (4 bottles per flask). 

 The end result was that I got to taste all these beers, with the only difference being the yeast used, head to head to see which I preferred. I know this isn't shocking research to most of you, but the difference was amazing. This allowed me to choose the exact yeast I want to use for this beer moving forward to get the best results for my tastes. 

The truly exciting part for me was realizing the HUGE difference yeast selection can make in the final product!

I am going to do this moving forward with all the beers I brew regularly. I was amazed how I was able to turn an error into something really educational for me and advance the quality of my brews (in my opinion) that I probably would never have realized had the mistake not been made.",Homebrewing

"Protecting electronics dangling in a fermenter I'm looking at dangling a couple [these pressure sensors](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mki183v1.html) inside a fermenter at different depths, in hopes that watching the difference between the two will indicate the SG of the brew, or even if it's not that accurate, the graph over time will tell me when the brew is done moving.

The sensor itself is gel potted and supposed to be able to survive chemicals - chlorinated water, beer. The circuit board, however, is most definitely not.

So I'm thinking of soldering it up, attaching a little snorkel to the sensor (that smokestack on it is about 2mm diameter), and then slathering it all with food-safe silicone.

I'm in Australia. Anyone have any idea where I can get/what kind of silicone to use? If I just grab a tube of silicone bathroom sealant from Bunnings - will that be ok to dunk in the fermenting beer, do you reckon? Is there special stuff intended for sealing a plastic fermenting barrel that might do the trick?",Homebrewing
"Critique my recipe - Leftovers IPA Hey Brewers!

I thought I'd put this recipe out for critique to try and improve on what could be reasonable base. I'm calling this one Leftovers IPA. The reason for this is that I had some pelleted hops laying about and I wanted to get use out of them before they started to go off or get stale. Let me know what you think.

Ingredients:
2 × 1.7kg Cooper's Pale Ale LME
1 × 1kg Light DME
1 × 1kg Dextrose
45g Mosaic pelleted hops
50g Amarillo pelleted hops
55g Cascade pelleted hops

Method:
• Steriliser everything (obviously)
• Bring 3L of water to boil
• Once water is boiled, add 2 × 1.7kg Coopers Pale Ale LME, 1kg Light DME, 30g Mosaic, 30g Amarillo, 30g Cascade. Bring temp down to simmer and simmer for 30 mins.
• Add 1kg of Dextrose and stir untill dissolved.
• Add wort to fermenter and top up with cool water up to 23L.
• Once temperature is between 18-23°C, pitch yeast sachets that came with Pale Ale LME tins.

Day 4
• Add 15g Mosaic, 15g Amarillo, 15g Cascade.

Day 7
• Add 15g Cascade, 5g Amarillo.

OG was recorded at 1090
FG is yet to be determined as I broke my glass hydrometer.

"2nd Batch of Cider. Thoughts, opinions, ideas? I have only made one batch of cider in the past. I used pie apples from a tree at my parents' house, and added a lot of water and brown sugar because the yield was so low. I carbed with carb drops, and it came out... average. I only fermented for about 2 weeks. Cider was pretty dry, had some slightly funky aftertaste, but it was drinkable. Not particularly sparkling. 

Now, I've had a 4.5 gallon batch of cider going for almost 7 weeks in primary. I crushed and pressed a few different varieties of apples from a local orchard. I added raw honey as well, no water. I tasted it over the weekend and it's pretty decent- quite dry. Girlfriend doesn't like it as much as week two lol. 

I put my fermenter in the fridge today to cold crash the cider. My plan is to cold crash for 2 days, and then add 1 frozen apple juice concentrate as primer to the cider and let it dissolve. Then rack, to my bottling bucket, and bottle. I was going to put some in a plastic bottle to squeeze every day until it was firm, and then pasteurize all of the bottles. My goal is to have a strong, sparkling, slightly sweet cider, and from all my reading I think I have a decent plan?

Anybody have experience priming with apple juice concentrate? Anyone have good or bad experiendes with an extended primary and no secondary? Tips on pasteurizing?

"Stainless steel keg pasteurization process. I wanted to share a pasturization process that I've been doing with good sucess using hot water. I'm only posting this because I've read a lot of posts saying that 1. it is not possible, or 2. not practical. For my purposes,  I do this to back sweeten my ciders and preserve them without restarting the fermentation process.  I like to age my ciders for a few months so they mellow out, and lastly I like to keep enough drink stored so I don't run out. So a shelf life is what I want without using additional chemicals. 

***ATTENTION***
I don't know if i need to put a disclaimer to tell people to be careful around extremely hot liquids and potentially heavy objects involved in the process. So with anything, please take extreme care when proceeding with the following if you were to try it. I am not liable for your injuries or damages to your equipment. I am sharing my experiences using my equipment at my own risk. So use your best judgment during the process. 
***ATTENTION***

The kegs involved are 5 one gallon stainless steel (SS) kegs, and two 5 gallon Northern Brewer SS kegs with rubber bottoms. The one gallons have a ball-lock system attached to the head during the process.

The smaller kegs will sit in a medium size pot filled with enough water a few inches from the top of the pot. The 5 gallon kegs will sit in an 8 gallon pot with the water line a few inches from the top as well. The top half to 1/3 of my kegs are not usually submerged. 

Bringing water to a boil, I'll take the pot off the heating element and slowly insert the keg. The temperature will start to drop rapidly as the keg warms up, usually setteling at about 140*F.  When the temperature of the water drops below 140*F, replace upto half of the water with fresh boiling water to bring it back up passed 160*F.

The pasteurization time and temperatures are 30 mins at ~140*F using the slow low temp method, and 15 seconds at ~160*F using the faster method according to this article by Britannica. [links here.](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pasteurization)
There are higher temperatures to pasteurize at, but i do not feel comfortable at higher than 170*F.

I will usually keep this up for 10 minutes, or until the top part of the keg that is not sumberged reads to about 160*F. At this point I am fairly confident that the cider is now pasteurized. I have done this and kept ciders for about 8 months now and have not had any restarted fermentation with added sugars, nor have I had any infections. 

As for the kegs, they both seem to be doing well and show that they can tolerate pasteurization temperatures. The rubber bottom on the 5 gallon kegs seem to be okay, without any obvious signs of ware. But i always figured i could just glue them back on again if they ever came off.

"Speidel Cap + Gas Bulkhead Mod for Oxygen-Free Transfers My usual fermentor to keg transfer involves a purged keg with silicone tubing  leading from my Speidel fermentor’s spigot straight to the bottom of my keg through the lid opening, with a cap loosely fitted to the top of my fermentor so as to not create a vacuum during transfer.  

I’ve noticed recently that less than 5 gallons of beer in my fermentor often leads to air getting sucked into the keg at the tail end of the transfer. Very likely a mixture of CO2 and oxygen. The latter not being so great for my hoppy beers. This cap with gas bulkhead mod helps alleviate that. I now hook up one line from my CO2 tank to my keg and one line to my fermentor pushing about 1-2 psi into both, with keg lid off and screw cap on Speidel loosely fitted. This helps mitigate, if not eliminate, any potential oxygen ingress by pushing any air out from both the fermentor and keg during transfer.

its close to my 12th batch and I always serve my beer (bottle conditioned/ priming) at 4°c cause thats the way i like it, but my brother likes it stupidly cold and so he places it in the freezer for a couple hours max before drinkin(as much as he can get away with before it freezes solid) and its always been close to cristal clear, but now he got a temperature controlled beer fridge and he set the thing to -2°c and naturally leaves every bottle in there. All my bottles that stayed on that temperature for more than a day were never the same again. Its cloudy, and it has a flavour thats off but i cant quite put my finger on it. 
First thing i thought it was chill haze, but if that was the case it should return to normal after warming right? Also it should not affect flavour.
Now i think it might be dead yeast. But it if the water never actually crystallized it should not have damaged their cells walls.

"Just finished my 2nd batch with all-in-one and I'm having trouble with water amount and/or boil-off rate So I just finished my 2nd batch with Brew monk (/hopcat) 30 liter version. I already made an excellent porter/stout and now I tried to make an quadrupel. I use the Brewfather app for amounts.

The Brew monk has a water level meter on the side, which I rely on. I measure my mashing water amount, pre-boil and boil amount with it. The thing is, when I sparge the water level indicator tells me it's missing a good amount of water. Today it was missing about 4 liters. So I sparged it with 4 liters more. This got me to preboil amount of about 26 liters as it should have, as I was aiming at 20 liters to fermenter. Well I brought it to boil and let it boil for an hour. The water level indicator said 24.5 liters and my fermenter agreed to that amount after I moved it to there, also gravity was way too low. So according to my masher the boil-off is about 1.5 liters/hour (that would be only  0.4 gallons/hour)

Same-ish thing happened with the 1st batch (It was a group thing, pre-made bewerages were supplied, so this isn't very scientific). It was sparging too low volume according to the Brew monk, and we sparged it a little bit more and again it resulted to too low gravity and bigger batch. As this was a lower ABV beer we managed to fix it a little with sugar and it turned out great.

TL;DR: I get too low pre-boil volume according to my masher's volume indicator, sparging more leads to said sparging water adding up to fermenter volume, **but** pre-boil volume is ok. Gravity is also too low.

PS. Can some one point me to a good non-biab sparging tutorial, that would be compatible with all-in-one malt pipe? I tried watching the grainfather video, but I don't feel like it told me what to actually do. Or I think I might have had stuck sparge twice now.",Homebrewing

"Questions about infections. I'm sorry. Firstly, I'm not worried. This isn't a panic post. I am indeed relaxing and having a homebrew, but I still have some questions about infections.

So, I am aware that the cooldown period is when the wort is most vulnerable, and that keeping a sanitized lid on the pot is important. I'm confident that all my equipment was sanitized, and that the wort was poured into the fermenter without contamination. 
Brewday was on Saturday (11/21/2020), and the fermenter spent all of Sunday bubbling away, which I was glad to see. Forums outside of reddit say that the yeast have now established their ""reign"" at this point, and infections (that is, if enemies are present at all) are unlikely. It is also said that the alcohol produced will also help prevent infections. In this, I am also confident that there is *some* alcohol present in the fermenter, though probably not the amount I want for the final product (OG: 1.094; target FG: 1.013; 11.5g US-05 at a terrible 71°F).
However, I did take out the rubber stopper and the airlock because it was getting gunky. I took sanitizer and soaked the area around the hole before taking it out, and Star San'd the crap out of my hands, the stopper, and the airlock— especially the underside part that points inside the fermenter— before putting it back. I think I did a good job with sanitizing, and I think an infection is unlikely. 

Here are my questions: 

1. Is a whole day of bubbling a sign of a healthy fermentation, and should I be confident that the beer is doing fine and that infections have been avoided for now? 

2. Is it true that yeasts can establish their ""reign"" and prevent other microorganisms from taking over, or can infections occur at the same time as an active/healthy fermentation period? 

3. If other microorganisms take over before the yeast gets to work, should I be looking for signs like weak bubbling or no bubbling at all? This is assuming I maintain a proper temperature and added an appropriate amount of yeast.  

4. If on bottling day I discover an infection, is it worth scooping out that film of white fuzz that I seen in pictures of actual beer infections? I hate the idea of dumping 4 gallons of 2 weeks of my life and $30 worth of malt, so I was wondering if there are remedies to this problem. I also don't want to open the lid, so I really have no way of seeing what's happening inside (it's a white bucket). 

5. How much alcohol does it take to protect the fermentation process? Similarly, if the alcohol floats to the top, why do pictures of infections show the spread of bacteria *on the top* of the beer? I guess this question is linked to questions 2 and 3, but I'm not sure. 

That's all the questions I have for now, but I'll probably reply with more in the comments.

Grain bill was 6.5 pound marris otter, 6.5 pound malted wheat, 1 pound oat.. fermented with Voss Kviek yeast.. 

I took a little taste after fermentation stopped and I'm pleasantly surprised. The herbal taste is present but not overwhelming. Its got a slightly sour note, a hay-like sweetness, and a grassy characteristic. We will see how it turns out but so far I'm pretty happy. Anyone else here try making gruit ale?",Homebrewing

"NEIPA Whirlpool/Dry Hopping I would like to put together a NEIPA recipe and brew it within the next couple of weeks, but I’m afraid that I am limited by my setup. For starters, a lot of the recipes and style guides I have been seeing use HEAVY whirlpool additions over 30+ minutes. I do not have a pump or anything like that to get a constant whirlpool going, so I’m not sure if a manual whirlpool gives the same effect. Additionally, I have never really dry hopped before, but I have a glass carboy and am concerned about introducing oxygen into the fermenter by dropping the hops in. 

Has anyone brewed any styles like this with a similar setup? Is it a lost cause? Should I hold out until I eventually upgrade my brew setup?

"PSA: Refractometers/Hydrometers will have different accuracy levels depending on both temperature and alcohol content. Calculators provided within. Simply put, alcohol interferes with the readings of a refractometer and temperature interferes with the accuracy of a hydrometer.    


Pre-fermentation you may be seeing different values between your hydrometer and refractometer because your probably testing the gravity of HOT wort. You'll need a [Hydrometer Temp Correction Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/hydrometer-temp/) to get a bit more accurate of a reading between the two. Refractometers normally have ATC (Automatice Temperature Correction) up to a certain degree (which is normally above normal mash temps, depending on the quality of your device).  

Post-fermentation may be showing different values between your devices because ALCOHOL interferes with the accuracy of a refractometer. In this scenario, you'll need to use your hydrometer (as normal fermentation temps are well within the temp range needed for accurate hydrometer readings) or use a [Refractometer Alcohol Correction Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/refractometer-calculator/) to get a reading that would match your hydrometer.  

In short, some of the better advice you'll get is to use your refractometer during production and use your hydrometer post fermentation when you're doing your logs.  

**During fermentation**, as to not waste too much booze, I normally use a refractometer and a correction calculator.",Homebrewing

"Murky Wort. Like really murky. Hey folks, long time lurker first time poster. I’m a beginner/intermediate brewer.  Doing all grain a while now and finally brewing again after way to long of a break. I’ve been doing mash In a bag (full volume) and just standard batch sparge. One thing that has always bugged me is the fact that the wort coming out of my mash tun literally looks like dirty mud dishwater. I’ve done really fine crush and I’ve done coarse crush and no matter what, when I lift the brewbag out, the wort is pretty damn murky. From what I’ve read a lot of people don’t seem to think it’s a problem, but one reason I’m focusing on this right now is because I can’t seem to really get a nice compacted trub pile in my kettle before transferring to the fermenter. I end up with a giant pancake mess on the bottom and lose a whole lot of potential beer. Aside from that, those YouTube videos of people transferring clear work are just kind of sexy :-). 

What part of my process can I look into or tweak to see if I can get some clarity back in? Will recirculating with a pump help anything? Is it my grain crush or water to grain ratio? I’m happy to tweak any part of my process based on suggestions. 

Ultimately my beers are turning out pretty good which is awesome, but aside from the final beer product I am just very interested in the process as well.",Homebrewing

I recently got a Tilt so I've had a lot more granular data on my fermentation. My OG was 1.084 and I was at 1.025 when I transferred to secondary (6 days after pitching). My FG was expected to be around 1.020 but it's stayed at 1.025 for going on a third day (though the tilt seems to bounce between 1.024 and 1.025). I'm going to leave it in secondary for the full week but now I just wasn't sure if it's just done fermenting since it's not moving or if it's stalled?

I recently brewed a Belgian tripel with an OG of 1.076 using mainly pilsner malt, with some Candi sugar for good measure.

"Broken Thermometer So I’m coming here with basically a question, but also looking for some reassurance. I HAD a glass thermometer as you will see in the link, and I put it in the wort right before I was transferring to a bucket just to make sure the temp I was getting on the digiboil read out was accurate enough to pitch my yeast. As soon as I got it half way in the wort, I heard a *tink* and then a bunch of smaller tinks, which confused me. But after I thought about it for a second I pulled the thermometer out of the wort and sure as shit it had busted and dropped all the things out of the bottom. 

The thought of dumping it passed my mind, but screw that after just brewing for 5 hours. So I transferred to my bucket and pitched the yeast and all. 

My question is, what are those little beads and should I really worry about them/will they mess me up if i let them sit in primary for the next few weeks? 

I planned on just going on as usual, fermenting in primary a few weeks(I’m doing a tripel), cold crashing, and then transfer to a keg. Also I think it’s important to note when I was cleaning my kettle after, in the bottom I’m assuming was 90% + of those beads that fell out.

"Jalapeño Pale Ale help I grow my own hot peppers. Last few years I’ve made jalapeño beers.  First batch was an amazing saison (and I lost the recipe).  My last 2 batches were IPA’s that were good, but not great. First batch too sweet (1# of C60, 9# 2row, 1# wheat), and same with the second (0.77# of C40, 7.5# 2row, 1.33# wheat, .66# flaked wheat).  Second batch I mashed too high (153), so that I’m going to fix. 

I want to do something lighter (2nd batch was boozy).  But I want some bready backbone for the jalapeño flavor to grab.  And it needs to have some body so it doesn’t taste like jalapeño water. 

My recipe: 5# 2row, 2# wheat, 3# Munich light. Mash at 150f. 75min boil. Cascade to bitter (38IBU) and Saaz at FO for aroma. 2 jalapeño at 1min.  2 jalapeño in secondary.  

My question:  how much light Munich too much??  Should I inverse the wheat/Munich??

I should say I'm a total amateur brewer (just a few BIAB batches) but I have a fair amount of automation, electrical and electronics experience. So assume I won't have any issues with the electrical/electronics side.

"Easy Non-Brew Hard Seltzer After a couple of failed attempts to brew a seltzer, probably a nutrient deficiency that caused the batches to stall fermentation, I ended up with this tried and true hard seltzer cocktail recipe inspired by Brulosophy. I’ve now made about 10 batches, and each one has been pretty damn good, especially the watermelon batch. 

Recipe:  
2,625 mL of Vodka (exactly 1.5 handles of vodka)  
2 - 4oz fruit flavoring (check with your preferred LHBS for flavoring options)  
500 gm Sugar  
50 gm Malic Acid  
Top keg off with RO or distilled water  

Notes:  
Ensure to blend well. I add the Flavoring, Malic Acid, Sugar, and filled the keg half way with water. I then stirred with a drill-attached mixer from NorCal Brewing Solutions. Mix well enough to dissolve sugar and acid. Add vodka, top off with water, blend for just a bit more to homogenize what is pretty much a cocktail in a keg. ABV is about 5.6%.  

Feel free to adjust sugar and acid levels to your liking. These measurements are perfect for my liking, and those that have had the honor to try my hard seltzer.

"What is a brewer to do when not making beer? Here's a funny little question that's probably borderline off topic - hope the sub doesn't mind.

I love homebrewing. Like a lot. Every single time I finish brewing a beer I clean up and put everything away while thinking to myself: *""Aw, we're done already?"".* I love the process - sitting outside, enjoying the weather even if it's bad, BBQing up some hamburgers or hotdogs while the mash is doing it's thing, all while drinking the homebrew I made a month or so ago. My local homebrew supply store even knows me by name I'm in there so much.

I try to keep myself from brewing more than once a week - any more than that and I just have too much beer. I know I can do smaller batches, or give more of my beer away. But I'm beginning to wonder what other things I can be doing during the week that will satisfy my itch to brew - or is it just a craving to create?

I recently saw a few videos by people who have their own pizza ovens. They made their own dough, rolled out their own pizzas and covered them with homemade sauces and ingredients. I realized that pizza making would probably be a fun thing for a brewer to try - it would be something I could iterate and experiment on through new techniques and ingredients - just like homebrewing.

I have been using the single body regulator, and would like to use the dual body one, however it is too heavy for my 5lb CO2 tanks. I was wondering if it is plausible to convert the dual body to a 2 way secondary setup by throwing a plug where the high pressure guage is and swapping the tank connector for a 5/16 hose barb, then mounting that inside my kegerator.

The concern is that Gulo is diastatic and I'm worried that a long bottle conditioning period may lead to bottle bombs. It tasted damn good when bottling so, ya know, I could just get smashed off my own hooch. Was is your infinite wisdom reddit?",Homebrewing
"keezer commercial and homebrew setup questions I'm curious if I'm thinking about this the right way. I'm starting to build a keezer and just need to order the draft components. My ideal setup is to have four taps.

"CO2 kills yeast? I have a friend who is experimenting with a wine that started as homegrown grape juice that she got and started fermenting on it's own and she was talking about concerns of the CO2 killing the yeast if she had it capped too long before putting a balloon airlock on.  
My input was that CO2 build up causes carbonation and could make a bottle bomb but doesn't kill the yeast. Alcohol past it's tolerance, heat, or potassium/sodium metabisulfite will kill it. Even if all the sugars are fermented out to dry most of the yeast falls out but there is enough (maybe dormant idk) that if you add sugar it will kick back up (such as to prime a beer for carbonation).  
Am I misinformed on this front?

The line I she gets it from is ""If we capped the bottle, the pressure inside the bottle would build until either the bottle exploded or the carbon dioxide killed the yeast. I don't think you want to find out which would happen first, so I wouldn't try it if I were you!"" which I would suppose the bottle will explode much before the yeast is killed and I didn't think that would kill the yeast.",Homebrewing
"Advice on Emptying an Old Keg Hi all,

So last week I was able to get a Large 50 Litre Keg from a local bar. I called them and they gave it up for free because it belonged to the previous owner who left it out back. The staff said it was somewhat full of Guinness and it was pretty difficult to carry back home (at least 100+ lbs). I have no intentions of drinking it since I’m unsure if its been opened before, but mostly because has been sitting outside in an alley for weeks.

I’d like to empty the keg for personal use (strongman training) but I’m not sure how to go about that. Some youtube videos suggest that I just need to jam a screwdriver and push the ball down to depressurize. But the videos only seemed to talk about kegs that are mostly empty. I’ve also heard that kegs can explode if overpressurized so I’m also concerned about emptying a full keg that has been left out for a long time.

I have never used a keg so I’m wondering if anyone could provide some advice on the safest way to deal with this.

TL;DR – I have a keg full of beer that’s been sitting outside for a while and I’d like to know how to empty it safely.",Homebrewing

Made my first batch ever yesterday (IPA), most of it went well but I know I made some mistakes I'll definitely remember in the future. My fingers are crossed that it'll turn out drinkable.

"A bit of a head scratcher. Three fruits. Three carbonation levels. I made a three gallons of a basic beer with 50% pilsner and 50 % wheat.  Yeast: Imperial whiteout and imperial suburban Brett.  SG: 1.040, FG: 1.006.

I fermented for a week, then racked into three 1 gallon carboys onto three different fruits from my brothers trees (1 lb cherries, 0.75 apricots, 2 lb plums).  The beer sat on the fruit for 5 weeks. 

At bottling, I prime each bottle to approximately 2.2 volumes with a sugar solution using a measuring device called a food injector.  This is my normal method and have never had issues with it.

I tried some bottles 3 weeks after it was bottled.  The cherry beer is probably at 0.5 volumes of carbonation. The apricot at 2 volumes. And the plum at 2.2 volumes.

"How Long Should My 2.5lb CO2 Tank Last? Hello fellow homebrewers,

I have been brewing hard cider for just about a year now. I carbonate all my cider and have a kegerator setup. It has been going well, and I have really been enjoying this new hobby. That being said, lately I feel my CO2 has been running out extremely fast. In the past, I could get 3-4 corny kegs carbonated, then dispensed from my kegerator with a single 2.5lb CO2 tank. Now I am having to refill my CO2 every 1.5-2 kegs.

To get into specifics, I generally will force carbonate my corny keg at 23 PSI for about 3 days. Then I lower the pressure to 8 PSI for serving. I checked my keg and CO2 regulator for leaks and found none. Is it possible CO2 is seeping out through my liquid line? I am under the impression that would make cider come out of the tap if that’s the case.

I thought this might be due to adding too much pressure, but even if I almost totally depressurize and let the beer sit for a few hours, I get the same effect when the beer comes out slowly.  This is really disappointing because I'm wasting a bunch of beer and I feel like I can't enjoy it.

"My batch from hell. Two Fridays ago, I brewed [this recipe](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/363082/avg-perfect-northeast-ipa-neipa-) for an NEIPA. No issues, it tasted fantastic after the first dry hop. After second, it was good, but not as good. Fast forward to kegging. This is the second time I've dry hopped with loose pellets, rather than using a bag or mesh container. I bought [this filter](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B00CH29IK2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for a closed transfer. This thing clogged within the first minute, so I took it off and went no filter. Then the racking cane clogged, so I cleaned that and put it back on. Then the QD clogged, so I cleaned that. Throughout all of this, beer is coming out, so I'm catching it in cups to just not make a mess. Finally, it's out of the carboy. I figured I lost about 1.25 gallons. I drank a few of the cups just to get something out of it.

Proceeded to force carbing, no issues there. The next day, I go to pull a pint off and nothing comes out, so I disassemble the faucet and it's got hop matter all stuck through it. Clean that out and finally, pull a pint off and it tastes pretty good. Not nearly as good as it had prior to the first charge. I noticed the tap was pretty loose, so I tightened as best  I could.

The next day, I wake up to find all remaining beer on the floor of my garage, with my ""drip tray"" literally dripping and filled with beer. I was so defeated. This delicious beer and all the money/effort that went into making it is now gone. Cleaning the garage was depressing as it smelled so good in there!

"Carbonated beer and oxidation Hey homebrewing folks. I just finished up a NEIPA. One main goal of the brew was to reduce grassiness and astringency which is something that I’ve encountered with heavy WP and DH hop additions. I have had great success with this run, thankfully. 

Now that it’s kegged and fully carbonated I’m afraid that some of the hop aroma I was getting on the samples has sort of faded. I’m thinking of doing another DH addition in the keg for about a week and then pulling it.

I’m obviously worried about oxidation because other than a lack of sticky hop aroma the beer is great. What are the chances a fully carbonated and oxygen free keg would oxidize if I pop the lid open for a few seconds when adding some DH?",Homebrewing

"Bottling yeast experiment result A while ago I posted here about a tripel karmeliet i was brewing and wheter or not the yeast from fermentation would be able to bottle condition or if I needed to add a bottling yeast. (https://old.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/jd0dse/i_should_repitch_yeast_for_bottling_right/) 

This is a pretty anecdotal experiment so do consider it as such.

What I ended up doing is splitting the batch, adding a tiny bit of cbc-1 to half the batch.
It's now been 4 weeks (also tasted both at 3 weeks) and the results have left me with more questions that before.

for priming sugar, I used candi syrup diluted in water (aiming for 3 volumes of C02)

the bottom line is both batches carbonated just fine, the added yeast was not needed:
- at 3 weeks the cbc-1 batch had great carbonation, whereas the other one wasn't quite there
- at 4 weeks it's hard to tell the difference with regards to carbonation

now here's the part I don't quite understand :
- the batch that did NOT receive cbc-1 has more yeast deposits in the bottles
- the batch that did NOT receive cbc-1 is very slightly sweeter (enough that I can consistently detect it in a blind test)

I'm guessing that could be explained by the different yeast behavior. it's also possible that I didn't have a consistent product between the two batches, as i transfered the cbc-1 batch from the fermenter first, so I guess it could have had more stuff towards the bottom.

Also for a futur batch, I'd aim for a lower carbonation, there's a lot of yeast in these bottles and the high carbonation tends to swoosh things around making it less pleasant.",Homebrewing

I was planning to purge a carboy with co2, slowly rack from one 6.5 gallon carboy to another, purge the headspace, put on an airlock, and open it in the Spring. But do I need a 5 gallon carboy so there’s less headspace?",Homebrewing

"Pressure Fermentation Temperature Control Hello all brewers. I realize temperature control isn't as big of a concern while fermenting under pressure, but in an effort to improve my brews, and experiment even further, I would like to set up something for temp control with a corny keg. Wondering if anyone has done anything like this or have any suggestions?

I am thinking of building a fermenting chamber with an old beer fridge and insulate a box connected to it. I know this part has been done, but I would like to control the temp inside the keg. I was thinking of drilling a hole through one of my keg lids and finding a bulkhead thermowell or temperature probe of some sort. 

Has anyone done this with their corny kegs? I feel like the idea above will work, but I am curious to see other's DIY setups.

"How much is too much acidulated malt? Planning on brewing an IPA/NEIPA later today. While ordering online, I could only purchase in increments of 1lb. So I figured for the acid malt I’d just buy extra and measure about 1-2% of total grist. Yesterday I ordered my grains from my LHBS online, went to pick them up and the grain wasn’t milled upon arrival. So they ask if it was ok if it was all milled together, I said sure and didn’t think more of it until it finally hit me laying in bed last night. So now instead of 1-2%, there is 6%. This is my first time using acidulated malt. Been brewing for about a year and read from various sources these malts help drop ph of mash slightly to help with efficiency and bring out hop flavors etc.

Now my question is this, should I go ahead with the brew day or scratch this batch for now and get new grain? What effects would having 6% acid malt have on flavor/efficiency in a  IPA?",Homebrewing

It was a kit from northern brewers that I got from my lovely BF for my birthday! I am brewing a hefeweisen. I think it mostly went according to plan except for a few things -

1. I spilled about a half cup of the malt syrup (on the floor, ugh), will this affect the brewing process?
2. I left the wort to cool in the sink with ice and water, and didn't realize our sink doesn't exactly hold water well and it was sitting without ice water for about 10 min before I realized. I filled it back up with water but ended up trying to cool it for about 30 extra minutes. The lid was on the pot for most of the time except when I was checking it. Should this affect it either?

"testing store-bought juice for preservatives before starting a big batch of wine There are four kinds of juice in my local supermarket (in Istanbul) and they all list no preservatives.

I plan to pitch yeast in sugar-water with some energizer (I don't trust my yeast, either) and then add it to four glasses of juice. If it bubbles, that would be the juice that I go with. 

Can I put the yeast into straight 100% juice, or should I dilute it to a particular specific gravity even just for a test? (Added complication: my hydrometer broke and the new one is going to take a few weeks to get here.)

"I Need Advice For My ""All Up EÑO Beer"" Recipe. After making a few gallons of Meads and Beers. I decided that I wanted to *make one.* I had two all grains under my belt, and I felt like with my research and knowledge, I could make my own all-grain brew, from complete scratch. I was partially correct.

**My Goal** 

I set out with the idea that I was going to make a highly drinkable, jalapeno ale. Since really nobody else online was doing what I wanted to make,  I toyed with the process of adding peppers and spice to make the brew spicy enough to *tingle* (not burn) and feel like it was warming. A very fine line I know. 

**The Process**

I started with a 4 Cup batch. it was seriously weird but I wanted to make a super small batch before I made a gallon or two of it.  The yield was 2.5 cups of questionable albeit very good beer. my main issue with that small of a batch was dealing with the yeast cake, clarity, and headspace. That first batch was honestly pretty good and was too spicy with the addition of habanero peppers as well as jalapeno, but I needed to make that batch and I'm glad I did, I saw a lot of issues with the original recipe and made the necessary changes. The first things I attempted to correct were the lack of mouthfeel, clarity, head retention, and obviously lower the spice.

After that, I waited a few days and made a 2-gallon batch with the necessary adjustments. Due to the micro-batch that the first one was, I now had really abnormal measurements that needed to be converted, which worked out in the end so, sorry when you read the ingredients and wonder wtf I was thinking using cups instead of gallons, or Tbsp instead of cups. This batch went amazingly. The process was easy, smooth, and could not have been better, It clarified perfectly too as a perfect jalapeno color. I bottled and let carbonate for 3 weeks, and then tested the first bottle. 

**The Results that I need help with**

What I got was a mostly clear, beer with a 1-1.5 inch head that was completely gone within 30 seconds. A mouthfeel that was best described to be ""If Budlight had an anorexic cousin"" but ""great flavor and spice"". The spice was perfect. A warm tingle in the back of your throat and tongue, that never built past that. It aged amazingly and was at its best around the 3-month mark but I did leave them all in a fridge the entire time after their carbonation stage. But the biggest issues that need to be addressed are Head retention, Mouthfeel, and clarity. 

If you could please let me know what needs to be changed to fix these issues, and if you are able to try it out yourself, please do and let me know how it went. I'm going to list the ingredients below, I haven't toyed with using xanthan gum (I still don't think I want to) and I'd like to stay as close to the original as possible, the flavor was amazing, I just need to know what to do to fix these issues. I do use Irish sea moss as a clarifier. With this current configuration, I get an almost champagne effect with the carbonation after the head is completely gone.

**Ingredients List/Recipe**

2 Gallons Recipe for ""All Up EÑO Beer""

* 34.5 cups of purified water
* 1 Cup of Rice
* 4 Cups of oats
* 12 Cups of Light Caramel Malt
* 4 Tbsp of Ginger Powder
* 2 Tbsp of Fresh ginger
* 12 Tbsp of DME (Sparkling Amber)
* 1.5 Cups of Honey (Clove)
* 2 Large Jalapenos split in quarters (during the entire boil)
* 1 Cup of Brown Sugar 
* 1 Tbsp of Hallertau Hop Pellets
* Nottingham Ale Yeast

OG- 1.049

FG- 1.017

ABV \~4.3%

Mash at 154°F (68°C) for 60 minutes. Mash out at 168°F (76°C), Bring to a rolling boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at 35 minutes from the end of the boil. Chill wort to 86°F (30°C) and pitch yeast. Ferment in primary at 68°F (17°C) until an FG of 1.017 is achieved. Bottle with 7 Tbsp of White Granulated Sugar, dissolved thoroughly and age for at least 3 weeks.

Note: I cold crashed before bottling to better the clarity however, I was still left with a less than Opaque brew.

**Final Thoughts**

Thank you so much for any help or even just reading. I'm not highly experienced however use brewing as a decompression method and I really enjoy learning about the process. It's incredibly fascinating and I love the history and science behind it. Any help is appreciated, Thank you again, and have a great day!",Homebrewing
"All grain noob question: mash thickness I have a question which seems pretty basic, but I can't find a good answer in my books or online. I'd appreciate it if someone can point me in the right direction!

What criteria determine your starting mash thickness? Most brewers seem to choose something like 1.25 or 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grist, but the choice seems almost arbitrary.

My assumption is that thickness of less than 1 qt/lb  would just be too thick to work with. I also understand the practical need to start with a thick mash if you're infusing for several rests. 

A ratio of 3 qt/lb is sometimes given as an upper limit, but I have no idea why.  Is it too thin to form a good grain bed? So much water in the first runnings that you won't be able to  include enough water in the sparging process?

Is there something that I'm missing? Some actual, noticeable effect on flavor or body? Why don't we always use, say, 1.25 qt/lb?

Thank you!",Homebrewing
"Fermenting after FG is reached Recently I have had some yeasty tastes in my beers, I am wondering if it might be due to bottling in 6 days and not letting it go longer in the fermenter even when FG is reached. Will this help at all to settle out more yeast or am I being crazy?",Homebrewing
"Yeast CO2 Production This is going to sound stupid but is there a definite point where no further CO2 will be produced by the yeast and if so is this the ultimate indication of complete fermentation?  Does yeast produce CO2 while ""cleaning up"" at the end of fermentation? Does it produce CO2 while breaking down diacetyl?

Reason I ask is, I have a ball valve on my blowoff tube. I got the idea of closing that for 4-5 hours after my SG was stable. Then I'll open it and see how much gas was generated. I don't have time to stare at the blowoff tube for a bubble that might only be generated once every 20 minutes. I'm assuming there will be a point where no more gas is generated and then I'll know fermentation is 100% complete but I need this thinking to be critiqued.",Homebrewing

"Oxidation causing an increase in bitterness? I recently bottled a DIPA, fermented under pressure and DH'ed once during active fermentation, bottled with my beergun and partially bottle conditioned.

"Eggnog Inspired Beer I know it's a little late but I'm gonna try to squeeze in a holiday beer inspired by eggnog.

I also have golden naked oats and flaked wheat on hand.  The GNO are a possible addition but with that high of % of wheat, is it even necessary? Plan on adding vanilla and nutmeg to it, probably in a mix right to the beer and then a tincture at bottling if needed (my preferred method of spicing beers).  I thought about adding cinnamon and clove as well, but I feel like that could cloud the lines between eggnog/pumpkin/spiced ale so I'll likely leave those out.

"Souring using probiotic capsules? Hey all!
I'm planning to attempt my first kettle sour, and wondering if anyone has any tips for me.
I was planning on using probiotic pills, which contain 1 billion lactobacillus strains per capsule.
I have a pH meter, and some lactic acid to drop the pH before pitching the lactobacillus, but not sure how much to add for a 23l (6 gallons in Freedom Units) batch.
Most videos I've seen on YouTube people just use probiotic drinks, so I don't know if that's a better option..

"Increased efficiency with recirculation Hello, this question probably gets asked a lot so thanks in advance.

I tested my new brew kit with a built in grain basket and recirculation pump yesterday. 
My estimated efficiency according to beersmith was 81%, and a post boil OG of 1.069. My actual efficiency and OG were 76.5% and 1.065.

Whilst I am very happy to be in the estimated ball park figure I was hoping to be even closer, if not bang on. I ran the recirculation pump gently throughout the hour long mash at 68C without much temperature fluctuation (occasionally +/- 1.5C) to ensure consistency throughout the mash. 
Could that have been an error I made? I've read about avoiding disrupting the grain bed and it's permeability but have never really understood the reasoning or science behind it. 

Cheers!",Homebrewing
"Best kveik option for pseudo lager Hi I am homebrewing for few years now and since I don't have the equipment to brew a lager I recently tried kveik Oslo strain which indeed created a very nice crisp lager like beer. Now I would like to experiment a little bit more with other kveik and I can see that there are few more options for crisp profiles. I can find lutra, skare and Oslo as I mentioned. Do you guys have any recommendation? Which of the three should be closer to a lager profile?

"Setup advice on first all grain brew I'm doing my first all grain brew and I just wanted to check that there aren't any hidden issues in my method. I'm trying to avoid buying any new equipment so I dug out an electric turkey fryer out of storage that basically works as a 7.5 gallon stovetop kettle with a heating stick. It has a spigot but no false bottom. I feel like this is too small for a 5 gallon BIAB so I was planning to basically do a traditional mash and lauter in this kettle using a paint strainer bag instead of a false bottom. I used brewfather to make the water volumes, I think I input the max volumes correctly.


For a detailed explanation:



1. Heat 4.4 gallons to strike temp in turkey fryer, add bag and grain and mash for 1 hour

1. Heat 2.7 gallons of sparge water

1. Drain wort into separate kettle

1. Batch sparge, drain

1. Remove grain bag and return wort to turkey fryer 

1. Boil, etc...


So my equipment limits my volume to max of 7.5 gallons at any step and I have to use the same container for mashing and boiling. Basically a BIAB with a sparge which as far as I've read only makes it a little more time consuming without any real detriment. The only issue I can see right now is I might overshoot my pre-boil volume if I squeeze the bag (and since this is a stout I've heard that might introduce more bitter flavor) and I can always just boil a little longer if I do. So please let me know if y'all see any issues! Thanks for taking the time.",Homebrewing
"had a bad batch of seltzer water in my keg, was able to empty the whole thing without the co2 attached, which made me realize if i wanted to, i could just take the keg to wherever i wanna go, without lugging the co2 tank around. is this right?

i could even overload it with pressure right before i go somewhere, just to ensure i'll still get to pour from it throughout the night.

i guess i shouldn't be surprised, i just thought at some point the pressure would be too small to push out maybe the last third or so of the keg. to my surprise it emptied the water entirely. pretty cool.

reason i had to pour it all out was because i tried out using the garden hose for filling up my keg this time. didn't work, i can pick up on the taste of the garden hose.",Homebrewing

"Rookie question about honey vs honey malt So I’m trying to make a beer close to Bell’s Hopslam and am not sure what to do to get a good honey flavor that balances well with the rest of the beer. I’ve read that adding honey even with around 5 minutes left in the boil won’t add much (if any) actual honey flavor to your beer. Instead what I’ve seen is the yeast will just convert the honey to alcohol and you lose most or all of the honey flavor. I’ve seen some recipes that add honey to the fermenter after fermentation is mostly completed. I’ve seen some that just use honey malt in the grain bill. What do you guys think would be the best way to get a honey flavor that’s noticeable, but balanced with the rest of the beer? I don’t want to make a sweet IPA, just an IPA that you can tell has a touch of honey. Bell’s actual Hopslam homebrew recipe just uses honey at the end of the boil, but I’ve seen quite a few people who made their own take on the recipe that use honey malt. Some use honey malt and honey. My planned grain bill using honey malt is as follows (btw let me know if anything looks off about this!):

***

10lbs 2 row

5lbs pale ale

.5lbs caramel 40

.5lbs honey malt

.5lbs carafoam

.35lbs acid malt

"Can't get Oxy Clean off glass carboy I usually use PBW to clean my glass carboys but I recently used scent free oxy clean. I unfortunately forgot and let it soak for about three weeks.

"My SG way lower than 1 to start with pulpy apple wine- is it an issue? I made this batch of apple and rasberry wine, I added 4kgs of sugar and pulped the apple and rasberry and put them in.

I put the yeast in today. I was wondering what was going on- is that there the pulp is too dense to get an accurate reading or I haven't added enough sugar?

When I did a side by side, there is a noticeable difference in color between mine and the Pilsner Urquell. The picture shows PU on left, mine on right. The PU is darker, almost a copper color. Mine is a pale yellow almost like hay. Assuming both grain bills are 100% Pilsner, what is the reason for the difference in color?

"Seltzer Water - Carbonator Question Hey guys, first post here. Thankful to be a part of such a chill community. :) 

I am an insane sparkling water/seltzer addict! I probably drink an average of 48 ounces a day, sometimes more. I have two 5 gallon corny kegs that fit in a Danby kegerator that I got on Craigslist, and recently moved up to a 20lb CO2 tank. I distill my own water too, and I fill the kegs with that.

My only disappointment (which is understandable) is waiting for water to carbonate. I'm familiar with force carbing and shaking the kegs up to speed the process along, plus I will have the other keg already carbed up before I do the next one. However, I'm curious if you had any suggestions using a carbonator to take it to the next level.

My desire is to eventually upgrade to something where my carbonation is instant and I don't have to put forth as much effort. From what I have read, the whole idea of ""instant soda water"" is not cheap to do. If I added a carbonator to this setup... would it be worth it? Would I need to go all out and buy a fountain dispenser and a chiller? Please advise.",Homebrewing
"Belgian Candi Sugar/Syrup Fermentability I'm asking this question because I was unable to find a solid answer online. My question is, ""Does the grade of Belgian candi sugar/syrup affect its fermentability?"" 

BYO states, "" Belgian candi sugar is sucrose that has been caramelized to some degree, depending on the color. Dark candi sugar will have more of a caramel taste than the amber variety. Aside from the caramel notes, it will behave exactly like table sugar.""

From the above, it appears that D-10 is just as fermentable as D-180.  If that's true, then flavors won't be imparted into the final product, just color.",Homebrewing
"WLP500 ensuring there isn't too much banana WLP500 has won more NHC medals than any other Belgian strain by a large margin. This confuses me, because every time I brew with it, I get a *ton* of banana ester, which is not typical of most Belgian beers (I know it's mentioned a couple times in the BJCP guidelines, but if it's there it should be subtle). I ferment this strain, as most people suggest, at 64 F to start and finish a little higher, 68-70 F. Yeast count at 0.75m/ml/P or thereabouts, O2 for a minute for low-med gravity, 2 min for higher gravity. That same process with WLP530 has landed me a gold medal for a tripel the only time I've entered one in a competition. I loved the results. But WLP530, despite being the famous Westmalle/Westvleteren strain, doesn't win many NHC medals.

What gives? Is there something I'm missing with WLP500? Why does it get so much love? Is there a way to use it and get a more typical Belgian ester profile?",Homebrewing

"After 25 years of brewing, I had my first disaster today I’ve been homebrewing for approximately 25 years. 

I’ve had a few stinkers – custom recipes that weren’t nearly as good as I’d hoped. 

But nothing major has gone wrong. No bottle bombs. No infections. Nothing that made me waste all the work involved in brewing 5 gallons of beer. 

That is... until today. 

My Christmas beer – a malty, higher-gravity saison – met an untimely end. 

It’s been a good while since I’ve kegged. For various reasons, I’ve just been bottling over the past year, year and a half. For some reason, the thought of cleaning a keg seemed more daunting than cleaning 50 bottles.

I had a Christmas beer that finished fermenting and a Christmas hard cider I was looking forward to enjoying over the next 34 or so days. 

Three days ago, I put the beer in the newly cleaned keg and lines. I hooked up the gas and gave it 35psi for 2 days to speed-carb it. 

Last night, I dropped down to 14psi, bled off the excess, and poured me a small glass full just to taste. Delicious! Everything I was shooting for. A couple of weeks of aging would do this batch a favor, but it’s still great as it is. 

Unbeknownst to me, my output connector that hooks into the keg had a crack in it. It must have been from the year+ of lack of use. 

I didn’t discover this until I came home this evening when I discovered...

Five gallons of delicious beer had leaked out into my brick patio. 

R.I.P. Christmas Saison.

"What to do with a Dry Irish Stout Extract kit? As the title says, I have a dry Irish stout extract kit (well, 3/5'ths of it) that I want to do something experimental with. 

I bought [Northern Brewers Dry Irish Stout kit](https://www.northernbrewer.com/collections/extract-kits/products/dry-irish-stout-extract-kit) a little while back and I didn't want to just make 5 gallons of the exact same thing as it was my first time brewing beer (I've been brewing mainly ciders, meads and wines) so I took 1/5th of the ingredients, made a gallon batch and it was pretty good. I then bought some lactose, found a few recipes for a milk stout and came up with 1/5th of a pound of sugar for a gallon batch, used another 1/5th of the kit, and I also added some cocoa nibs soaked in vodka (also something from a recipe for a chocolate stout) and threw those in secondary.

Today I racked both into secondary which is completely clear plastic, and you can barely tell the difference between the two beers. The stout it pitch black, as I expected, but the pale is only ever so slightly lighter in colour. 

I checked and double checked the seals, the airlock and everything seemed air tight. I’m also fairly confident that I sanitised properly. Could this be oxidisation? An infection? Or has the crystal malt just darkened it more than I expected it to?

I did adjust water chemistry the first time, and I got a decent mouthfeel w/ this brew. Would that involve increasing the flaked oat content in the grain bill?

Also, in terms of hops -- a few of my friends have said this is a very high amount of hops for a NEIPA (not sure I agree). It does have a slightly hoppy taste but I was under the impression you need these big dry hops to get that haziness in the beer. Curious if this can be toned down slightly? Was toying with the idea of no hops in the boil and going all whirlpool/dry hop. Also was considering substituting Galaxy for some El Dorado hops, as I've had some killer Citra/El Dorado combos that really appeal to my tastebuds. 

Appreciate any of the veteran's insights.

"Yeast starter tips (first time) Hi all,

I am going to make a batch of California Common next week. Always fancied it since reading about it in Brewing Classic Styles. My LHBS has just by chance got in one packet of wyeast 2112 California Lager so I snapped it up along with the rest of the ingredients I needed. 

Looking at my wort gravity (1.055 for 24L) it looks like I am going to have to make a starter. I've never done this before and have a couple of questions! 

I'll make 2L of 1.040 wort with some nutrient, pitch the yeast and leave it in a 5L carboy for a few days, swirling it every few hours. Will temperature control it best I can (left out a tester and water gets to about 33 degrees left overnight in our kitchen).

Where I am confused...

I only do partial boils so I guess I will need to take into account the volume of the starter when diluting my wort? 

Do I need to take into account the alcohol the yeast has made? It'll be tiny right? 

Do I need a starter at all??

Thanks!",Homebrewing
"Freeze Distilling Cider I have fermented a mix of organic kiwi apple and grape juice and want to freeze distill it.

"Does keg line oxidisation effect beer in keg? Hello,

I moved house for renos 3/4 months ago and turned off my kegerator as I wasn't going to be using it. I had a hoppy blonde in one keg and a milk stout in the other.

I've since returned and the beer in the lines seemed heavily oxidised, the blonde was pink after 3 months of sitting in the tube. I thought the keg was tapped as I was getting a lot of foaming before I turned off the kegerator and I assumed if there was anything left it would be heavily oxidised from 4 months of sitting in a warm garage. These assumptions were wrong. I opened the keg to clean for the next brew and there was still about a gallon left that looked and smelled fine. Im now drinking the milk stout and honestly, it tastes fine.

"Recalculating my gravity after adding more sugar? Hello Team

I had some weird stuff happen to me recently with this last brew, so bear with me.

First off, this beer I'm doing is a nothing special brown ale - Had it taken off and done everything as expected the final gravity should have been around 5% - (Gravity reading I took was 1.040). I'm about 90% certain I added the liquid yeast to early to everything before sealing it up and potentially thought I had just killed it. So, I let a few days go by and checked the airlock and ... nothing. It wasn't going. I popped it open and it looked like SOME activity had happened, but not a lot. A mild, scummy looking ring around the top, but not much else. Definetly not what I'm used to seeing, especially at this point. SO, I decided to try again with an extra Ale yeast satchel I had. Before that, I mixed in a little sugar mixture (1.5 cups water (warmed) 1 cup sugar, 2 tbsp brown sugar) so this new yeast would have something additional to eat and also took a gravity reading.

So, my OG, prior to adding extra sugar, was 1.040
My current gravity is 1.020

my question is how do I calculate my gravity at this point? 
I'll obviously take a final gravity reading before bottling and all that, but I just want to see if there is some kind of formula I can use for my circumstance? Do I use the 2nd gravity reading? Do I do some kind of subtraction or division?

"Mash time's effect on attenuation? So I've done a few brews on my Foundry now. Before I had been using a three tiered system, with 60 min mashes and never thought anything of it. But after looking at Beersmith's mash profiles it seems to recommend 90 minute mash's for lighter body beers, and the 75, then 60 as you increase the targeted body for the beer.

Does the mash time actually have a significant effect on the body and attenntuation if you're still hitting the mash temps for that style? For example, on a beer mashed at 156, will it end drier if mashed for 90 instead of 60 min?

"Pump recommendations for moving hot sparge water from Grainfather heater I have a Grainfather and the Grainfather sparge water heater, which is basically just a coffee urn with a spigot at the bottom. I fill it from my RO drinking water tap at my kitchen sink, using a hose with the water heater on the ground. Then I lift it up to the counter, and from there lift it up on top of a sturdy stepstool that is on the counter. Then I plug it in and heat it up. When it’s time to sparge, I connect a hose to the spigot on the heater and use gravity to run sparge water into the grain basket. 

The problem with this setup is that I have worsening arthritis. It is not easy for me to lift 4 gallons of water up onto the stool on the counter. I also worry about the safety issue of having all of that hot water up where it could in theory get knocked over, though it is pretty sturdy.

What I would like is to be able to keep the water heater on the ground and use a pump to send the hot sparge water up to the grain basket. Self-priming ransfer pumps with racking arms don’t seem to be able to work with sparge temp water. A wort pump would be OK with the temps but the spigot is only 4 inches off the ground, so I’m not sure how well they would prime. Plus, there’s no way to firmly connect a hose to the spigot. Presently I just jam a silicone hose up on there are far as it will go.

*****So not only being sneaky I need to figure out the ratio for all of this is in a 64oz juice jug *****
I am hoping some smart people out there can help me. I am pretty smart just not about this...haha. 

So I have used a whole pack of red star yeast in a 100 percent juice bottle. I pour some out to make room for foam etc. Then I add some dissolved sugar about one cup. At first just left it open and waited at least 3 days for that. It did work but yes I am impatient. 
I bought some air locks and idk they don't seem to prove helpful.
I do get buzzed etc


Now I started using alco-tec. They recommend a 5 gallon bucket for brewing. I cannot do that. I need a ratio for a normal juice bottle... 
How much alco- tec to add and sugar. I store the bottle inside a open shopping bag to catch any over flow and wait even 24 hour with the Alco-tec 48hr. I store it in the basement which is dark. 
Anyway, I get a decent tasting bubbly drink. It does get me buzzed.

\- Planning to ferment at \~35°c (kveik strain) and adding dry hops at high kreusen, could the high temperature affect the taste and make it bitter? Hoping for loads of citrus with s touch of malty body and sweetness.   
\- Planning to ferment at 68°c to avoid too low FG, acceptable?

My plan was to; 

\- Mash @ 68°c for 60 minutes  
\- Boil for 60 minutes add \[X\] hops at \[?\]   
\- Chill to \~30-35°c   
\- Pressure ferment at \~35°c and add dryhops at high kreusen. Total

"Is the only difference between taprite primary/secondary regulators the fittings? I have a Taprite 740 (""primary"") and a Taprite 1660 (""secondary"").

They both say that the bonnet has a maximum inlet pressure of 950psi and the body has a maximum inlet pressure of 1800psi. The 1660 accepts a bracket so that it can be wall mounted, but otherwise the bodies look very similar.  The only functional difference I can see is that the ""secondary"" has a standard LHT on the high pressure ports, whereas the ""primary"" has a RHT.

If I attach the ""secondary"" to the ""primary"" with a RHT to LHT nipple, is that essentially the same thing as building a primary? Can it safely handle the pressure coming out of the cylinder, or does it actually need a first stage regulator to be safe?

Another question: taprite sells a different regular, 5740, which is targeted at soda. How is that different from the other regulators?

"Bottle conditioning a lager - Saving part of liquid yeast. I have ??  I am brewing a Mexican/Vienna lager, partial extract.

Hello Homebrewers! 

So lets get straight to the point! I live in a place where i have limited (not even) access to everything from equipment to grains, yeast, hops...  I have read alot about homebrewing but i guess nothing helps like doing it and learning. 

With what i got access to currently, i’m prepping to brew my first beer this week after thinking of doing so for quiet a while now. So i gathered what i could find to fit the profile of a good American IPA (if you can call it that) and here is what i’m thinking of for my recipe: 

Grains: 
- 3kg pilsner malt 
- 1 kg victory malt 
- 1 kg aroma malt

Yeast:
- Safale s-04

Hops:
-cascade whole leaf hops
-citra pellets

Process:

-Mashing all grains with (how much water?) for an hour 
-Strain grains
-Sparge ? 
-Adding 25grams cascade hops after turning off flame
-boil wort for 45 mins 
-add 14 grams citra &amp; 14 grams cascade 
-boil for 10 mins 
-add 20 grams cascade 
-boil for 4 mins
-add 10 grams citra &amp; 10 grams cascade 
-boil for 1 min
-cool down (ice bath) 
-move to fermenter 
-pitch yeast (how much?) 
-ferment for 2 weeks
-dry hop after 1st week ? 

My main concerns are the amount of victory and aroma malt used and how much water to start with and how if not total amount fits a 5 gallons batch.

"Milk Stout Off Flavour x 3 Hello all. This is driving me a crazy. My stouts and other darker beers used to be the only thing that turned out before I got into water chemistry and fine-tuned some of my other processes. For some reason, I keep getting a rubbery-like aroma in my milk stouts. The taste is a little alcoholic as well but this was just a sample. This is the third time I've tried brewing a milk stout and I get this aroma and flavour. 

A little bit of history.. My ""light"" beers like cream ales never turned out well, until I started using lactic acid for ph and campden tablets to remove the chlorine. I started pressure fermenting recently (maybe 6 batches in) and I love it! Had ambers and IPAs and cream ales all turn out, but the first milk stout turned out like my batches before adjusting my water and pressure fermenting.

Some thought the come to mind:

1. Maybe the lactose is messing things up, but i thought it would be pretty straightforward to use. I used 1/2 lb at the end of the boil of a 5g batch. Maybe I am missing something? Should I use lactose at a different time?

2. Ph too low? Maybe all of the roasted malts are lowering the ph of my mash too much? I don't feel like this is the off flavour they would contribute too. I don't take a ph reading either, but probably should

3. Maybe I forgot to use campden tablets for the sparge water? I know I used it for the mash water.

4. Maybe a bit of an underpitch. I used wlp002 and made a 2L starter but saved some for a future brew. Didn't seem very actice, but pitched it anyway

Any ideas are appreciated!

"Bottle bombs and how to stop them. \[copied from r/BrewingNewbies\]

First off, what is a bottle bomb? Well, to keep it short, it's when the co2 levels are too high for the container to handle, and in turn, it explodes.

Now how do we stop our bottles from turning into a war missile? It's actually pretty simple (which means it pretty overlooked).

**1) Your yeast is not done!!!**

If you have any amount of sugar in the container your storing your brew and there's yeast still left alive, then it's going to eat the leftover sugar and continue to make alcohol and also co2 (that's the stuff that makes your bottles go boom 💥).

**2) Basic thermodynamics**

Co2 and everything else in the universe obeys the laws of physics. As the temperature rises so does pressure, making it even more important to not keep your brews in a hot place.

**3) Your airlock is fucked man**

Enough said. If you don't have or can't get an airlock your probably WAY too young to be even brewing in the first place.

**4)** **Contamination**

Wild yeast and bacteria eat and ferment certain sugars that brewers yeast can't. If your brew does become contaminated then it can lead to over-carbonation.

**5) USE. THE RIGHT. BOTTLES.**

If you're using just a plain regular glass bottle to store your co2... It's going to blow up. You MUST use beer or champagne bottles if you are looking to keep some of that sweet sweet carbonation.

I hope this helped clear up some confusion or explained some things more.",Homebrewing

"2.5 Gallon Setup Questions Hi All,


My dad gave me all of his brewing equipment from 20+ years ago, brewed my first batch with an extract kit and made drinkable beer. I really enjoyed the brewing process and it was cool to make drinkable beer, even after a few mishaps. I'm not looking to upgrade piecemeal so much as build a new setup.

Anyway, I want to do all grain and 2.5 gallon batches, this has led to me to the Anvil Foundry 6.5 (with pump kit). I really like the idea of the e-BIAB option both for space savings and because my gf asked that I not brew in the kitchen :)  So, a couple of questions:

1. I'm looking at the Anvil 4g bucket fermenter, is this a good option? I also see that people ferment in kegs, is this viable or preferred for 2.5 gallon batches? 

2. I hated bottling and want to keg. I'm seeing 2.5g and 3g kegs, should I go with 2.5g or do I need extra space like I would in a fermenter? 

3. I'd prefer not to buy a mini-fridge at this point as I'm in a rental house that has two full size refrigerators. We don't have anything in the spare fridge other than beer anyway, can I just put the kegs and CO2 tank in the fridge and serve from there with a picnic tap? 

4. I really like sours and will brew my own. I've read mixed things about kettle souring and sharing equipment with non-sour beers. Is it safe to use the same kettle for both? I would probably dedicate one keg and one fermenter to sours as I'll likely always have one on hand.

"Question about adding malt late in the boil Sunday I brewed an imperial stout. I was doing a partial boil with an extract kit. I encountered a few issues and I’m wondering if I should have done anything differently.

The recipe called for adding 6 lbs LME and 2 lbs of DME with 10 minutes left in the boil. I’ve never done a recipe that called for adding malt that late. Adding this much cool malt stopped the boil for about five minutes while the pot got back up to temp. As it returned to a boil the pot came close to boiling over and I had to remove it from the burner a few times before the foam settled. My timer went off while I was still working on getting the hot break to settle. I didn’t want to start cooling the wort while the hot break was still going on so I left it on the burner until it settled. I think it was about 10 minutes. After I cooled it in an ice bath I noticed a lot more stuff floating in the wort than usual. I wasn't sure if it was proteins or scorched malt from adding it too fast or bits of grain that got out of the grain bag. I decided to pour the chilled wort through a grain bag into the fermenter to filter out the solids. I'm not sure how all this is going to affect the beer. Any feedback would be appreciated.

What was the point of adding the malt so late in the boil?

Is the extra time on the burner going to be noticeable? I I figured some extra bitterness from boiling the hops longer wouldn’t be too noticeable in such a big beer.

How is filtering the solids out before fermenting going to affect the beer?",Homebrewing
"Why does wine turn into vinegar? (Answer) [copied from r/BrewingNewbies]

Most people know that vinegar is made from wine, but what makes wine into vinegar in the first place? Well, there are two answers, a long one, and a short one. The short answer is adding additional oxygen after the first week. The long answer is because of a bacteria called Acetobacter. It produces something called acetic acid, it basically makes vinegar, vinegar. Acetobacter uses alcohol and oxygen to produce acetic acid. That's why it's important to not put in any oxygen after the first week, maybe even sooner.
Now how can you prevent that? Well, you can use chemicals like Campden Tablets, Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite. But if you're like me and don't want to use added chemicals then there are a few steps you can take to make sure Acetobacter doesn't have the time or resources to turn your wine into vinegar. First fermenting, as I said above you should never add in more oxygen after the first week, you can keep it out by using an airlock, or by using a siphoning tube when racking or bottling. Second, you can sanitize everything before use. Yes, Acetobacter is on anything and everything but sanitizing will make it so there isn't as much of it when you're brewing. Lastly, you can pasteurize OR cold crash your brew when it's done fermenting (note: this only works if the Acetobacter hasn't already turned your wine into vinegar) this will help kill anything left alive if you're planning on leaving it in long turn storage.
I hope this helped clear up some confusion because I know some people want to hear details and explanations and not just ""don't put in oxygen"".",Homebrewing

"Columbus Pale Ale I love CTZ hops, so I decided to make a single hop pale ale this weekend.  It's cooking nicely in my WFH office right next to me.  My only question is - to dry hop or not?

Recipe for 5.5 Gallons

10 lbs Pale Malt

1 lb Crystal 15

.5 oz Columbus (16.2%) 60 minutes

.5 oz Columbus (16.2%) 5 minutes

1 oz Columbus whirlpool

US-05 American Ale yeast

I used RO water and mashed in with 5 gallons. I adjusted with 10g of gypsum, 1.5 g Calcium Chloride, and 2.5 g baking soda.  I did not adjust the sparge water since I batch sparge, although I might start doing this as an experiment.

Measured OG was 1.047 and I put 6 gal into the fermenter because I ended up with not as much evaporation as I expected.  I used [this hop spider](https://www.morebeer.com/products/hop-spider.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaVbo-Ui5m9228mVQma97erRMqrR4rgYsSNFU3byEecR0F3i-nRqiJMaAm3KEALw_wcB) from Morebeer for the hop additions, and a nylon mesh bag for the whirlpool.  According to Beersmith it should be 45 IBUs, but the sample I took did not seem to be super hoppy so maybe the hop spider had some negative effect on the hop utilization.  

I'll need to make a call on dry hopping tomorrow I guess.  I ferment in a Speidel so no pressure transfer for me, but I normally put it into a CO2 purged keg by draining it through the ""Out"" post of the keg.  I might try some sodium metabisulfite to further prevent oxidation.

Throughout my entire process I've been brewing on a budget with a focus on perfecting my process before investing real money into my home brewery.  I've also been locked into apartment brewing since the beginning and still am, which provides its own set of challenges.

My current set up is as follows: Igloo beverage cooler mash tun (batch sparge), regular ol' brewing pot that I boil on a stove, kitchen sink ice baths, two buckets pouring back and forth to aerate, Speidel fermenter that I have rigged for closed transfers (no true temp control), makeshift keezer with two 2.5 gallon kegs and picnic taps.

"To upgrade or to overhaul Here's my current rig: 10 gallon SS BrewTech kettle, the brew bag, 1800w induction burner, hotrod heatstick for extra power during boil, Jaded mantis chiller, Brewjacket immersion. 

I do 3.5-5 gallon BIAB batches. I live in 700 square foot New York apartment with an 11 month old taking up increasing space and attention, so efficiency in all aspects of my brewery is key. What I am trying to decide is whether to add pieces to my current system, or get a completely different system. Here's how I see those options right now:

**UPGRADE CURRENT SYSTEM**

My first thought is to add some kind of grain basket that can hang on top of the kettle when draining. I'm getting tired of having to hold the bag while it drains, and a ratchet to hold the bag isn't an option for me because of brewing location. 

Also considering adding a pump. Mash recirculation would be nice, but main benefits for me would be decreasing chilling times and the ability to do a real whirlpool so I'm not getting as much trub in the fermenter (I know this has no impact on beer quality, but I just want less in so I get more finished beer at the end lol). Would also like to be able to pump the wort into the fermenter instead of needing to use gravity (this would let me change where in the apartment I brew). 

Would also add something like the blichmann brewvision thermometer so I could monitor strike and mash temp on my phone and not need to check the kettle so often before the boil.

Any other thoughts on upgrades I could do to make things easier?

**JUST BUY A NEW SYSTEM**

The obvious choices here are either the Grainfather or Robobrew. Either one would essentially take all the different components I already have or would add in the upgrade scenario, but shrink the amount of space required to store them all. The Grainfather's bluetooth capabilities would be a huge plus for me. Step mashing would also be awesome since I don't do this right now for fear of scorching the bag. An all in one system would let me automate a lot of parts of the brewday that I can't automate right now - this is probably the biggest selling point for me since the kid has made brewdays trickier to pull of with my current set up.

**DRAWBACKS**

The upgrades would add more stuff for me to store, and space for my gear is already at a premium. 

My biggest concerns about the all in one systems are that there is a lot more stuff to break, and that if something breaks, the whole system could become unusable. Right now if one of my components breaks, I can just replace it and still use all the other equipment.

"Let's talk keg couplers I just filled my first keg. Those, who are kegging their beer, what type of keg are you using? 

Here the ""only"" couplers that are used are A,M,S, with M being used mostly for soft drinks. I went for A type because it looks clean. Refundable deposit for 15l keg is beteween 45 and 90 USD, so it is an affordable way to obtain a keg or two. Are you kegging your beer, or do you prefer bottles? Why? What coupler?

"Any experience with home-canning? My father loves to homebrew. I help him when I’m able, but he’s not been able to go through his beer quickly enough to make new batches at the rate he wants to. A big part of this is due to covid and not being able to have guests over to drink it. For Christmas I wanted to get him a growler machine or a can seamer so he can can his own homebrew. This way he can give out his homebrew to friends and family to enjoy and continue making new batches. 

I know I know, we have plenty of growlers, but of course he doesn’t want to give out the nice ones if he doesn’t know he’ll get them back, and the cheap twist-cap ones don’t keep the beer fresh nearly as long. He also hates the process of bottling his beer and has been kegging it for the last decade instead, so I don’t want to go that route. 

Does anyone have any experience with canning your homebrew or with a growler machine that won’t break the bank?",Homebrewing
"Do I need rice hulls? Apologies for yet another question about rice hulls, but other posts weren't clear enough for me (I guess I'm just asking for critique). Also, it's pretty cool that my username is somewhat relevant for this post.
 
Here is my current grain bill (for BIAB- 3 gal batch):
5.5lb White wheat malt (52.4%)
2lb 2-Row malt (19.1%)
2lb Munich Malt (19.1%)
1lb Rice Hulls (9.5%)

I've read suggestions that say I don't need rice hulls if I have a good amount of barley in the mix. 

Can I omit the 1lb of rice hulls, or should I keep it as a safeguard? If keeping the rice hulls improves efficiency, I'll probably keep them. 

(And since we're on this topic, I have another 3gal BIAB recipe planned involving just 6lbs White Wheat Malt, and 2lbs Rice Hulls. Is this a reasonable grain bill?)

"My first batch ever is on it's way! Finally after lots of lurking in this sub and asking for advice I started my first batch ever.

It was supposed to become an all grain Pilsen but after the first struggles of an surprisingly big cooking pot and a ""not so perfect instruction"" it will be probably more like a chaos speedy strong.

It is based on a 100% Pilsen malt with a 6.5% bitter hops.

In the beginning i was very much struggling with the pot size that was easily 3 times the size of the biggest heating field my kitchen had to offer.

Instead of the expected resting temperatures every rest started out too hot before the temperature cooles down and I started the timer. Every Single rest was about 10 degrees higher than expected except for the last one when i finly managed to understand when to stop the heat and anticipate how much it continues to rise the temperature after.

I succeded the iodine test and was happy. I had the expected  wort strength in my mash and was ready to remove the grain. So far so good but that is where the plan completely disappeared.

I started out with 16 L of mash, recipe said i should add additional 12 L. But I did only 5 as my wort got incredibly watery and dropped down to 6° Plato instead of the 11,5 needed.

What to do I thought to myself. I don't want a weak watery beer. So I started to boil the hell out of the wort to get the percentage up again before adding the hops. I got back on track but way less wort than needed. After a reduced hops time (i only had about 2/3 to half of the quantity i should have for the 41gramm of Pellets) the wort was back up sky rocketing to 17° Plato...

At this point i wasnt happy, i was tired from already 8 hours of cooking. I was disappointed by the momentary Situation and in an mood that I just wanted to finish. To the at this point only 12 L i threw in the remaining of my yeast. If it is already stronger than usual i thought by myself that it can also accept almost double the yeast.

I filled it all into the plastic fermenter and to my even bigger disappointment it was leaking. I didn't saw a crack so It hat to be the valve. I checked it and started to juggle my future beer from one freshly sanitized pot to another to find out if the leak got less until I realised that whoever put the valve on the pot put the seal on the wrong side. I started to get angry that this small problem caused me additional loss of time. At this point i was only 5 hours away from waking up to my next work day but I changed it, sanitized everything again aaaand the bucket was still leaking. Much less but still enough... I couldn't take it any longer. I put the fermenter into the tub and could ignore the leak for the night. I needed some sleep.

Next day the leak was magically closed. The bubbler bubbeled fabolous and my hope was high again. Only 3 days later (today) there are only 6°Plato left. Supposedly it should take 2 weeks if I believe the recipe to be left with only 1/3 of the original strength.

First taste test is already promising. It's flavour full, a bit un harmonic still but not too bitter and I like the taste of the hops. Maybe tomorrow or the day after I plan to fill it up into bottles for the last carbonisation. (it already has some, but I want more)

Thanks for reading about my Chaos speedy strong Pilsener

Until now the foam that forms when pouring into the measuring cylinder falls down within a second. But maybe that will get better if the carbonisation is stronger.

For me it is almost certain that this wasn't the last time brewing.",Homebrewing
"Blueberry Maple Brown Ale: Blueberry addition timing. My dad and I are going to be brewing this coming weekend, and I chose to try and replicate a beer my girlfriend and I had a few years ago in Florida. I'm wanting to try and make a beer inspired by their Breakfast Club Blueberry Pancake Brown Ale... I'm curious as to what gives the best Blueberry flavor. Adding blueberries to the wort, or I was told to add them to the the keg post fermentation. I've never done anything with fruit or back sweetening before. I'm personally leaning towards the post fermentation approach, because I'm afraid that the blueberry notes are going to change dramatically during fermentation. I'm just wanting to see what anyone has to say about that from their experience. I'm aware that the fermentation process should be completely done before back sweetening. Probably going to attempt cold crashing as well. I would love to know everyone has learned from their experiences.",Homebrewing

"How would you describe the ester flavors of A62 Bell's House Yeast? Bell's mentions that you can ferment their house yeast warm and let the esters open up a bit but they only say it has a 'nice ester profile', which isn't very descriptive.  I personally have a tough time as well putting a finger on it based on a few batches with hop forward beers.  Had a BJCP certified buddy taste a Centennial Blonde with A62 he got some pepper and earthy ester notes but may have been more hop driven.  Any other thoughts?  Bell's beer is not available in Canada so it's kinda tough to compare to the commercial versions.  In any case, I'm glad I had a chance to get a yeast sample as any homebrew'd beer with A62 turns out great.

It luckily went on sale right when I decided to purchase it, so yay. Anyway, for those of you thinking about getting it, I wanted to put it a little report (and another one when I get a second keg).

The first thing I did was take out all of the shelves whatnot. One keg fits fine without any further messing around, but I want 2, so I proceeded to remove the plastic molding on the inside of the door to get more space. Unfortunately, it was all glued on, so I pulled off the gasket around the door (which just fits into a grove that goes around the edge of the door) and started to pry off the plastic. It wasn't too hard, but it wasn't a very clean job. the plastic was thin, so I ended up pulling it off in pieces until it was all off (it's verymuch like the annoying plastic packaging that lots of stuff comes in that is always obnoxious to open). I broke off the protrusions in the insulation afterwards so the inside of the door was flat. The gasket now doesn't fit well since the groove it fits in was part of the plastic I ripped off, but some glue or double-sided tape should be enough to put it back on. I'm going to drill a hole in the door and mount a faucet there. There is plenty of room above the kegs for disconnects, tubing, etc... and thermostat is high enough it won't need to be removed to make room for 2 kegs. 

I can't say for certain if 2 kegs would fit since I only have one, but I did trace my keg and cut a cardboard circle out to get an idea. It looks like it would *barely* fit 2 after the alterations I made. I'm going to get another keg and chance it. I'll use the second keg regardless of if they both fit or not.

I'll check back in when I get a 2nd keg and can confirm they both fit.",Homebrewing
"Can I brew cooking wine from a kit? Hi /r/ homebrewing!

I've been brewing beer for a little over five years. I take the process very seriously, spending time on perfecting recipes, using proper equipment and sanitizing. Throughout that time I've also used cider kits to make something else than beer every now and then. And while the results are less than perfect, some of the cider kits have turned out plenty drinkable and have been a hit at severals parties.

One thing I have never considered trying to brew is wine, as I don't think the results will be very good. I've seen my local brewing store sells kits for wine alongside the cider kits, but I am skeptical. However, I live in Europe and my country has very strict alocohol laws, meaning wine is very expensive. As such, there is no such thing as buying ""cheap cooking wine"", as even the worst quality wine you can find will have the same alcohol fees as an expensive wine (the alcohol fee is flat per ABV). There also is no such thing as cooking wine with salt added as I have heard countries like the US has. The cheapest bottles I can find are around $12 at the moment, and if I want something I can also enjoy a glass of I will need to pay at least $15. This effectively means cooking dishes with some wine in them, like pasta bolognese, or onion soup, are some of the more expensive dishes I make - which I find a bit silly.

Then it dawned on me, why don't I just brew some cheap wine from Red Wine Kit? The quality probably won't be great, but it should be decent enough for cooking. I figure one batch should last me at least a year or two if I only use it for cooking as well. From my understanding, one of the more important things about cooking wine is that it should be as dry as possible - and according to the wine kits I've seen in the store, they end below 1.000FG unless you specifically kill the yeast before it finishes. So if I just let the yeast finish out, the results should be really dry and hopefully tasty enough.

Now. I am posting here for general tips and a few specific questions. Does anyone here have experience with using such ""cheap"" red wine kits? How are the results? Any tips for adjusting the process if the end goal is cooking wine? Any tips for what grape to go for? I doubt mye home brewing store has great selection, but I saw they had a Rioja one - and I usually enjoy Rioja when talking about proper wines.

My main question is about bottling. I don't have wine bottles and would prefer not to buy any new gear for this experiment. Would bottling wine on longnecks work with normal caps? Wine bottles usually have corks, which breathe. However, screw tops, which seem to be getting more common on wine bottles, don't breate I believe. I would guess a long neck with a normal crown cap would work just fine. I have some 0.33L bottles standing around, and that amount would also be quite perfect for cooking I believe, as I usually use a little over third of a normal wine bottle.",Homebrewing

"Acetaldehyde, infection, or PH? My dad and I recently tried making our first braggot. It was kind of a ""what do we have in the cupboards"" type moment so the recipe isn't perfect. We tried to go for a stout-like profile

Heres the recipe:
1. Safale us-05 
2. 1 lb Chocolate malt
3. 5 lb Honey
4. 1 lb flaked oats
5. 3.3. lb Liquid Malt Extract (Dark)
6. 1.5 oz cacao nibs

The grains were steeped in 2 gal of water at 156° F for 30 minutes, then the Liquid malt extract was added and boiled, at 60 minutes 0.5 oz of cacao nibs were added. 

The honey was dissolved in 3 gal of distilled room temperature water. Then the cooled wort was added to the must. To bring the whole thing up to 5 gals. 

Before pitching the yeast this tasted amazing, and felt very promising! Low acidity, very malty and a great mouth feel. 

Fermenation was very active and formed a very nice krausen. The braggot was left to ferment for roughly 2 weeks then my dad got impatient and racked it into a carboy. It sat in the carboy, reformed a new krausen and continued with a healthy fermentation for another 2 weeks. 

There were no off smells, or pellicles at any point of the fermentation.

We just got done racking into a corny keg, and took a small sample. It was incredibly tart, almost fruity in my opinion. Kind of similar to over-boiled / scorched coffee. 

Any ideas of what went wrong? And what are some possible solutions? Could it be acetaldehyde?

Tldr; made a stout-braggot and it turned out very sour. Almost positive no lacto or wild bacteria was introduced. The wort/must wasn't acidic to begin with. Tastes like burned coffee, how fix?",Homebrewing

"Anyone have experiences with a floating dip tube keg lid? Does anyone have experiences with this product (or equivalent)?: https://www.kegland.com.au/floating-corny-keg-lid-aka-the-corny-floater.html

In theory, it seems like a better solution to cramming a floating tube onto a short liquid diptube.  At least:

* easier to swap between regular and floating tubes (I don't disassemble kegs often)
* I need only one per keg in service, instead of committing the diptube to the whole fermentation-and-service cycle (assuming I'm willing to open the keg)
* friendlier towards my sanitizing technique: small amount of sanitizer (or more of boiling water) and shaking and rolling.  can sanitize the lid separately and swap out.  (I assume can't use CO2 to push [enough of] the sanitizer out, but that seems to be equally bad with all ""trubless"" dip tubes)

My main concern is if the lid seals: I have a bunch of ""unjerked"" bought-new kegs, so I'm assuming the lid will seal on those.  My secondary concern is if the solution is good only on paper, and not so nice when you actually use it.

"I'm getting sick of these Corny style posts and disconnects. The leakage rate is unacceptable, at best. Once again, one of these poorly designed fittings has let me down. It's basically taking any and all fun out of the exercise. 
The slightest sideways pressure (or weight hanging off it) on the disconnect causes a major leak. I think the line to the pluto gun (which I keep inside the serving fridge) must have rested against one with the force of about 0.01 N last night, because I check it today and half a cylinder of gas is gone.

There *has* to be a better system for small vessels and volumes. I don't want to have to disconnect every single thing and shut off the gas every night. And even if I did, I'd probably still forget. You should be able to trust fittings implicitly.

I'm considering looking into Nitto or aviation style fittings - at least you can trust them. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

"Is My Fermentation Done For? So I brewed a fairly large 5 gallon biab stput last week. The OG came out to 1.106 I believe, I added 2 lbs sugar during fermentation. Before the sugar I belive it was around 1.092 or something, forgot to write that down. 

My question is did I kill my fermentation. The scenario was I brewed Monday morning and didn't have a lot of time so I didn't pitch my yeast until that night. I got antsy and jumped the gun with my sugar and ended up boiling it cooling it and pitching it into my fermentation Wednesday morning. 

It fermented strong for a few days now Sunday evening I took a gravity reading and im getting a reading of 1.050. My end goal is 1.017. With all the added simple sugar will my yeasties go back to the maltose? Is there a way to referment this beer? Pitch another starter?

1. One hour mash at 152
2. I used ph5.2  
3. I built a small starter 800ml of 1.040 with omega Irish ale

"Blackberry tart cherry mead So I decided that I needed more mead in my life, because I hadn't made any recently.  Looking through what I had ingredient wise, I found a blackberry port kit I got a few years ago and never made.  So I figured might as well make some mead from it.  I went to go and check my honey supply, and found out that the bucket I had crystalized all 2 gallons.  Back in the summer, I saw tart cherry juice at Costco, so I grabbed 4 boxes, or 7 L of the stuff.  So I hatched my plan.  I read how to liquify honey, and that I should never get it over 140 F.

[So out came the sous vide](https://i.imgur.com/cbXMPgu.jpg)

"Same brew.. Keg vs bottle, different taste So the wife got me a mini keg for my birthday, this has been my first kegging experience.

The last gallon I bottled. The last of the kegged beer kicked so I opened one of the bottles tonight and it tastes.. Off. Not bad. But not nearly as good as the kegged beer did. I'm wondering if its a bit of the yeast I'm tasting but not as ""yeasty"" of a flavor, but its a kveik (my first) if that makes a difference. Anyway.. Is it always this way?

No matter which recipe I seem to follow or what clone kit I get, the end results have never matched up to the expectations I have for how that beer should turn out. Don't get me wrong, I think it's largely due to me and not necessarily because I'm brewing with extracts.

One of the biggest issues I'm having is getting those punchy hop profiles into the beer. I've followed recipes, boiled, steeped and dry hopped, but what I'm getting is a malt heavy tasting beer. It's driving me insane and I don't know how to fix the problem.

"Question about Crystal Malts Just as a thought experiment, I was tring to figure out the effect of substituting different crystal malts, and the effects on the color and flavour profile of a beer. Either when matching existing recipes, or building recipes of your own, how do you pick which Crystal malt to use?

For example, consider a recipe calls for 5% of the grain bill to be Crystal 60L. If you only had Crystal 30L on hand, would it be approximately equivalent to use 10% Crystal 30L instead (twice the amount, half the Lovibond)? Or 2.5% Crystal 120L (twice the Lovibond, half the amount)?

My gut tells me that once you get up to the higher Lovibond numbers, you'll start picking out some more toasty, nutty flavours that weren't present in the lower Lovibond Crystal malts. Perhaps the Crystal 120 was a bit of an extreme example where the equivalency falls apart somewhat. 

But at least for the low-mid range crystal malts (say 15L to 60L), can they all be interchanged with each other as long as one considers the proportion being used? If I only had some Crystal 30L in my inventory, could it be equivalently substituted in place of another Crystal malt in a given recipe by just using proportionately more/less? What differences would I expect from making those substitutions, all other things being equal (same mash profile, base malt, etc)?",Homebrewing

"Clove Phenolic in a Lager I have a lager sample in my yeast bank that consistently produces mild clove notes and I thought someone in this reddit would have some insight. 

This spring I pitched dried 34/70 lager yeast into high-gravity wort to make a Maibock at 10% ABV. The beer was clear of any yeast-derived off-flavors. I then used that yeast cake to produce a light lager at under 5% gravity. The light lager was over-carbonated but tasted pleasantly of cloves to everyone who tried it. 

I top-harvested the yeast from the light lager at high-krausen and stored it. I have used the yeast to create 3L starters (stepping up twice from 30ml) and brewed three 5 gallon batches, each having the same clove note.

Experienced tasters and brewers have tasted my beers and I have not had a significant, notable contaminant in my brews in years. I have hundreds of batches of experience. So I believe my sanitation to be reliable and consistent. 

In short, I have a yeast sample that consistently produces phenolic compounds that are indistinguishable from that in Hefeweizen. 

Has the lager yeast mutated to become phenolic, or is there some other microbe contaminating the sample that is pleasantly phenolic? Does a phenolic lager deserve to exist? Is it special and worth preserving or am I just confusing an undesirable off-flavor from some known contaminant with a totally separate ale separate style.",Homebrewing

"Does reducing the pH prior to fermentation reduce the amount of acid produced by the yeast? I've been adding lots of bicarbonate to reduce the tartness of my sugar wash fermentation, and it works decently, but is still a bit acidic for me.

Could I potentially be better off adding an acid like HCl to get a lower starting pH (around 5), and then adding bases *after* fermentation to reduce acidity?

Also if anyone has any general tips to reduce tartness (perhaps a different yeast strain?) they'd be greatly appreciated. My standard recipe is just 1 gallon DI water, 1 lb dextrose, 4 g Fermaid-O, EC-1118 and various amounts of Sodium/Potassium bicarbonate (aiming for 300 mg/L).

"""Mass"" Production Home Brewing Just wanted to share my methods of brewing large volumes of beer on a medium sized all-grain setup. ""Mass"" being equivalent of 4 corney kegs. Anyway I think it could be useful for anyone looking to double their output without having to buy any new equipment. This method could be used on a single batch setup (to now make 2 batches) or on a 2 batch system (to now make 4).

* You will need to have two heating pots and a mash tun big enough to fit the extra grain 

I have a typical three vessel setup. 14 gal HLT/strike water pot, 14 gal mash tun, 14 gal brew pot. In a typical method you can only get two batches per brew out of this setup (about 12 gallons of finished wort)

Start with the mash as per usual, adjusting for the extra grain and strike water. In my case its usually around 36-40 lbs of grain and 11-13 gallons of water. This is super close to the top of the mash tun but less head space equals less heat loss, haha.

I then heat 14 gallons of sparge water while I mash, then start the transfer of water to mash, wort to boil kettle. Once the boil kettle is full I fill the mash with the rest of the sparge water to the top. Empty the HLT of any water, and continue to drain the rest of the wort into the HLT vessel. (About 10-12 gallons). There will be a small deficit of sparge water around the end, about 4 or 5 gallons, so I continue to sparge with 140 degree tap water. If some of you dont like that then I suppose you could pre heat some extra sparge water and keep it in an extra pot until you get to this point. I however feel this small amount of tap water is a non issue to flavour or quality in any manner.

You now have 1 pot of extra sugary wort and 1 pot of less sugary wort, but now totalling double you usual volume. You can now boil each as per usual, hopping just one pot, (remember to adjust the hops for the total batch volume). Doesnt matter which pot you hop in my experience. I usually just hop the first one to start boiling. 

Once boil is complete I run one pot at a time through the counter flow chiller into my 4 carboys being sure to divide each pot equally. 3 gallons of extra sugary wort into each carboy and then 2.5 gallons of watery wort into each carboy. 

If you dont like the separated boil pots or you want to try 2 different hop profiles from the same mash you can combine the wort using the mash tun or another vessel. If anyone is interested I can show you how I do that as well.

Anyway this is how I double my output. My brew days almost always consist of 4 batches which I usually find ways of making them all different through dry hopping and pot additions while all coming from the same mash. I then have extra for trading for another style with another brewer or a bunch of one beer for an event or ways of experimenting with the effects of different dry hop additions or yeasts on the same wort. 

And if anyone is wondering why I dont get bigger pots, its because:
1.I have already invested in this setup which I had originally planned to make double batches with. 
2. Space is already crammed as it is
3. Boiling that much liquid in one vessel would require major heating. 
4.This way I can heat two smaller amounts at the same time, barely increasing the overall brew day.",Homebrewing

Recently i got even more involved in the process and started using pH strips and brewers friend water calculator to adjust pH. This has caused my efficency to climb 10% points. Thought this might be a intresting point for those strugling with efficency and to show the importance of pH.

This effect was demonstrated on a dark mild single infusion mashed at 64C for 60min (78%) and the current pilsner that got a slightly more complicated mashing protocol since the manufacturers of lutra kveik recomended a protein rest. 52C 15 min, then 62C 30 min and finally 69C for 30min.

That all spice is dominant.

I just racked into the secondary. I'm hoping some time in the secondary will mellow it and that some of the abrasiveness is just the beer being green.

"Help with my milk chocolate Stout stuck at 1.03 Hey there,

My first semi-grain brew from my local brew shop. [Link](https://i.imgur.com/cCUdqKZ.jpg)

Og was 1.051. Supposed to be 5.6% abv, but after two weeks it was stuck at 1.03. It's still stuck there after I repitched some lager yeast a week ago.

Having talked to u/audis4gasm on one of the daily threads, I concluded that I steeped the mash at WAY TOO high a temperature. My first time using this and I need to get my mom's candy thermometer for next time, methinks.

So, I screwed it up. Having Googled this for days, I've come to four possible fixes:

1)Glucoamylase;
2)Beano;
3)Tossing my cacao in a cup and a half of vodka, and then dumping *that* into the fermenter; or
4) Accept my weak as tea beer and move on.

I would appreciate any suggestions or anecdotes from the Reddit hive mind as to what would work best. Thank you!",Homebrewing

"Homebrewing Help I'm a new homebrewer, but long time homebrew-appreciator, and am having some problems.

My setup: Brewzilla 35L, Fermentasaurus, Corny Keg. 

I have brewed 4 or 5 batches so far, and every one tastes weak/watery. I am aware that ""water has no taste"", but it tastes like the beer has been mixed with water. I have made 2 or 3 batches with kits and 2 or 3 batches with all grain. They all have had the same problem, to varying degrees.

I am assuming I am doing something wrong.

Here are the steps I follow to make each batch:

1) Fill brewzilla with some water. The recipe book I follow is for stovetop and doesn't take into account the false bottom of the brewzilla, so I generally have to add much more water to start than the recipe calls for. The amount of water is still less than the total water required for the batch, however.

2) Heat water to strike temp

3) Add grain, lower to mash temp

4) Mash for 60 minutes, stirring every 10. I don't have a mash paddle, so I'm using a large wooden spoon.

5) Lauter for a few minutes

6) Pull out mash, let drain

7) Sparge until the water in the brewzilla hits the target amount for the recipe. The water is not pre-heated, but ""hot"" from the tap

8) Boil for 1 hour, add hops as per schedule

9) Turn off boil, chill with counterflow until temp is between 68-80; usually pitch in low to mid 70s.

10) dump into fermenter and pitch.

11) Ferment for 10 days

12) Transfer to corny keg, set PSI to 15

13) Wait 3 days, set PSI to 10-12

14) Drink

I have a hydrometer, but I have yet to use it successfully, so I'm not sure what percentage my brews have been coming out as.",Homebrewing

"Stout tanks mash tun I'm putting together a system upgrade and going with a two vessel no-sparge setup for 10 gallon batches.

Initially I had planned on two spike kettles, and I have already purchased my custom 20g boil kettle. Before ordering my tun, I discovered the stout tanks mash tun that has a bottom drain. On my 3 vessel propane setup I was using an inverted keg with the bottom cut off, and having a bottom drain made cleaning pretty easy.

So right now I'm trying to decide whether to get the spike kettle with a dip tube, or the stout tanks kettle with bottom drain. I think the price would be close in the end after adding the false bottom to a 20g spike kettle, maybe a little less since shipping is free. I guess not having matching kettles could be considered a downside if you're OCD.

The SS brewtech mash tun is nice looking, but I don't know why they always insist on ruining a nice triclamp set-up by adding one weldless fitting to everything. The insulation is also not necessary since I'll be using a RIMS.

"Infection keg cleaning question I recently had an infected batch, decided to keg it, and well, it was still a dumper.

"Insel Kreide Biere Brut Clone In the last weekend of October I got to experience this delightful beer. It's like they married champagne and a pale ale together to get a delightful baby of the two. 

I have never tried cloning something like this before, so I am wondering if any of you have had it before, come across clones or similar? All I have found online are Brut IPA's which this certainly is not.

My guess is obviously starting with a champagne yeast, and then a noble hop of some sort. The hops really didn't come through much though, and on the nose it smelled almost completely like champagne. So I wonder if they had grapes in there too.

"My CO2 regulator is NOT designed for beverages... Should I get a new one? After using my CO2 tank for a while, I can say that serving from my keg is a pain in the ass. However, I just realized that my CO2 regulator is probably not one built for beverages. 

The pressure dial goes from 10 psi MINIMUM to 230 psi. Like, it's clearly not ideal: I don't need anything above 50 psi and I essentially can't dial into a nice serving pressure (1-2 psi). Also last time I got a new CO2 tank refill, there was a lot of sputtering, a variable flow rate, and a bit of liquid CO2 coming out the gas line. It froze over pretty hard for a bit, though it seems to be mostly in working order now. 

I bought this one off of Craigslist for 25 bucks. Should I buy a new one that can handle a pressure range more suitable for serving beer and other beverages? Should I get a mini regulator or something similar that allows me to take my kegs on the go?

I know longer boils will increase gravity and body, but that's also going to result in a higher ABV. 

In designing a grainbill, the only solution I can think of that allows me to skip adjuncts (and I'm thinking this is wrong)  seems to be to plug in the base, Carmel, and specialty malts to hit the target ABV of 14%, then just load in carapils until it hits the target OG of 1.178.

"Bottling once gravity stabilizes? Usually when I've brewed, I kept my beer in the fermenter for two weeks then bottled, only because that was mentioned in the first tutorials I'd read and that's just what I'd always done.  I have a Tilt, though, and lately have been checking on the gravity of a beer I recently brewed each day.  The beer was brewed on Sunday and about a day ago the gravity hit 1.012 and hasn't budged since then.  So, I'm wondering if there is any reason to not go ahead and bottle?  Some things I've read have said the beer will continue to ""condition"" (although I don't understand exactly what that means, aside from perhaps some flavors continuing to develop) even after fermentation has ended, but my thought is why not just go ahead and let that happen in the bottle instead of the fermenter, and get a head start on letting the beer carbonate?

(And if it matters, the yeast was WLP565 which apparently gives a pretty aggressive fermentation.  BeerSmith estimated my FG would be 1.020.  I started it at 65ºF then bumped it up to 80ºF over a couple of days, since I'd read that will encourage the yeast to produce more of the Saison flavors I'm looking for.

Dry hop using a magnet attached to a bag, and magnetizing that to the lid of the bucket. Probably have two stuck up there for active stage and later stage.

"For those who hate bottling, but still do it, try 22oz The title pretty much explains the point. My homebrew school in town (yes there is a LHBS that also has as a brewing school next door) strictly uses 22oz bottles when they have their students bottle beer. The reason was that most people don't just drink 1 bottle of homebrew at a time, and this would save loads of time and space during the bottling process. I couldn't agree more.

The cost for a 24 pack of 12oz bottles is only $1 cheaper on morebeer than a 12 pack of 22oz (not promoting, just using for cost comparison). So for spending $1 more you can almost get the same volume, but you have to cap less, sanitize less, and clean less.

So do I add water to the 13,5 qt of mash so it will do a total of 7.5 gallon and then start the boiling ? Thanks !",Homebrewing
"40% Brewhouse Efficiency on Brewzilla Hi all,

Just finished brewing what was supposed to be an Imperial Stout. Been brewing for almost 3 years now with relatively good results except for hazy beer. However, this is my fourth brew with the new Brewzilla 3.1.1. On my first brew, efficiency was 52% and then on my second and third I managed to bring this up to 64%. However, today, I had the awfully pathetic 42% brewhouse efficiency that makes me want to either retire or set this device on fire.

I was supposed to end around 1.079 and ended at 1.050. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's still a drinkable 5.5%-ish stout but not what I wanted to brew. Standard 5 gallon brew, with RO water and adjusted chemistry. Ph was fine too. Sparge was fine. No stuck mash or sparge either. Milled most of my grains except for the Chocolate and Black Malt. Also did what other Brewzilla users have suggested which is stir twice during the first half hour of the mash. The only difference for me was that instead of brewing at 67C/152F I brewed at 70C/158F with the intention of increasing the body.

Any clue what the hell could have happened here?

"SMB addition to NEIPA creating sulfur smell - Have I f**ked up? I'm getting a strong smell of sulfur (rotton egg smell) when I open up my beer 7 days after bottling, the following sections is where I feel like I messed up. I'm hoping after a couple more weeks, the strong sulfur smell goes away in the bottle. It hasn't changed the taste of the beer, though there is no proper taste from that initial 7 day bottle taste test, as I'm expecting a flavour to come about after the 3 week mark from bottling.

I decided to brew a roughly 5 gal (22L) NEIPA and after reading so much about Brülosophy's experiments decided to add more SMB powder than was recommended. It was roughly 1g of SMB, where the recommended amount was 0.3g for the size of the batch. This was partly due to not having a scale to measure it to that precise amount, but in hindsight now: I'm thinking when I diluted the powder in a cup of water, I could have just measured out roughly a third of the cup.

In addition to this, I think the step where I added the powder was probably wrong too: I decided to ferment real mango fruit (following the correct freezing and defrosting methods) 7 days after initial pitching of the yeast. Instructions told me to add it the fermenter before bottling, but I'm not sure how much this would have played an effect. Because I was nervous about oxidation, I decided to add that cup of SMB at this phase, which led into another short fermentation with the sugar that was released by the mango. The smell that was released was a strong sulfur smell, which I disregarded because I knew it was because of the SMB.

What I'm hoping to hear is some reassurance that this has happened to someone and that sulfur smell just goes away in the next 2 weeks during that conditioning process. Otherwise will it just smell like that every time someone opens up the bottle? The smell slowly dissipated as I left the drink in a glass as I understand the sulfur is able to reduce as it is exposed to the atmosphere.",Homebrewing

Just looking for some quick advice/get some thoughts.

 I've currently got a brew fermenting. Now this is some real entry level stuff, like a malt extract, brewing sugar, hop tea and yeast in a fancy bucket entry level.

With the lager yeast I used, it was supposed to be at 20-25 degrees Celsius for 7-10 days. The problem is I never got it over 18 the entire time, like its sat pretty much at 18 celcius for 12 days now.

I'm planning on bottling 2-3 days from now and today a heating pad I purchased 2 weeks ago finally arrived.

"Hard root beer from a mead makers perspective. Is there a reason not to do it this way? Help with what flavors make “root beer.” Various hard root beer posts seem to be making beer or adding spirits to make hard root beers.  Or using syrups for flavoring.

Has anyone had any experience with these? I was thinking about essentially making an adobo sauce with the chillies that I add in after transfer to my fermenter to chill (I'm a dirty no chill brewer) this (I think) would mean that the chilli puree is sanitised and have time to impart its flavour to the beer.

"Help, OG is Half of Expected Value Hey everyone,

I put [this](https://byo.com/article/the-king-of-stouts/) Old Rasputin clone (5th one down) into  Brewfather yesterday, resulting in [this](https://share.brewfather.app/eHc2uMipTFbOOP) recipe. I brewed it yesterday and had the following problems:
- The recipe called for 6.13 gallons of mash water which should result in a ""mash volume (water + grain)"" of 7.63 gallons according to Brewfather. I poured the grain in then filled it with water and it ended up being 8.5 gallons.
- I have an Ssbrewtech mash tun and used the Vorlouf attachment for 5 minutes, 45 minuted into the mash. I then used the recirculation manifold for the remaining 10 minutes of the mash. I then sparged the remaining 2.56 gallons of water. However, the had grain settled to the bottom so the top was a few gallons of liquid (see [here](https://imgur.com/a/rol5K0G)) and I'm not sure I got anything out of the vorlouf or sparge other than additional water.
- I then transferred to a kettle, but I only ended up with 6 gallons of water instead of the grainfather calculated 6.5 gallons. I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do, but I just topped it up to 6.5 gallons.
- By then end of the 60 minute boil, I had 5.15 gallons of wort instead of the Brewfather calculated 5.69. i had just estimated a boil-off rate of 0.81 gallons per hour, but ended up closer to 1.4 gallons. Is that too much or did I measure something wrong?
- I lost my counterflow wort chiller so I just used my glycol chiller in a Grainfather fermenter. As such I wasn't able to pitch the yeast until this morning.

Anyways, I should have ended up with about 5.4 gallons of wort at 1.098, but only ended up with 5.1 gallons at 1.048. I'm brewing another beer today, what do I need to do differently?

"Purp-ale? Beer-gundy? [Beer Pic](https://i.imgur.com/8fUGQdZ.jpg)

A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/ho61uk/purple_heifer_recipe_tap_handle_and_pour/) reminded me that I've had some [butterfly pea flower tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BTI2AVO/) for a while that I had intended to try in a beer (for no particularly good reason).

I have a nice honey blonde ale recipe that I've made a few times before that seemed like a good base.  Scaled down to a 2.5 gallon batch:

* 5.6% ABV, 22 IBU.
* 1.045 OG (1.051 with honey), 1.008 FG.
* 4lb. 4oz. 2 Row
* 4oz. C15
* 4oz. Honey Malt
* 4oz. Flaked Oats
* 8oz. Honey, added post-fermentation
* 17 IBU Willamette @60min.
* 0.5oz. Willamette @5min.
* US-05
* Yellow Balanced Bru'n Water profile (75 SO4, 60 Cl), pH target 5.30

Single infusion mash at 155 for 60 minutes, mashed a bit high to prevent the late honey addition from drying it out too much.  Fermented at 67F.

Once fermentation was complete, I filled a coffee mug with butterfly pea flower tea (about 20 grams).  I then poured boiling water on it, let it steep for a few minutes, and strained the liquid off.  I did that 3 times, which left ~8oz. of very dark blue tea.  I let it cool to ~100F and then dissolved the [raw honey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L4G2PBJ/) and added the resulting ~16oz. of liquid to the fermenter, which kicked off a secondary fermentation that lasted for a couple days.  My hope was that the fermentation from the honey would also minimize oxygen addition from the tea.

I raised the temp to 70F for a couple more days, then cold crashed and added gelatin (don't want a murky purple beer), and kegged the next day.

The beer doesn't look quite as in-your-face purple as some examples I've seen, but it's a very pleasing reddish-purple (almost crimson?) color.  The tea flavor itself is very mild, it doesn't really come through in the finished beer at all.  To my memory it tastes the same as previous versions without the tea... a nice smooth blonde ale with a subtle (but definitely present) honey flavor and aroma.

There is a slight astringency on the back end... since I didn't use a proper strainer, which I would definitely do if I tried this again, it's possible that I ended up squeezing the leaves when I was trying to separate the liquid (though, since it's not technically a tea, I don't know if you really get much astringency from it).  The honey flavor comes through nicely in the beer though, so a touch of tea-like astringency doesn't actually feel out of place.",Homebrewing

I brewed a chocolate orange porter last night and used adjuncts for the first time in a few years (cacao nibs and dry sweet orange peel). My first mistake was brewing in the evening - I am notoriously careless and rush more when I brew at night. My second mistake was adding the cacao nibs and sweet orange peel to the boiling worst sans filter/bag/basket. I should have added them to my hop basket at least but my mistake didn't become apparent until I started recirculating during cool-down. My pump clogged immediately and in that moment I realized my mistake. I let the wort finish chilling and then disconnected my pump (it was loaded with nibs) and tried to drain it into the fermenter using just gravity, but there was also a clog in my ball-valve. Feeling desperate, I sanitized my arm and reached into my chilled wort and unscrewed the back of the valve - nothing. I then realized what I had to do: I sanitized the end of my ball-valve, put my mouth around it, and blew back into the kettle. Beer immediately started flowing and I was able to mostly fill my fermenter... until it clogged again. This time I had my wife hold a (sanitized) strainer basket over the fermenter lip and I lifted the kettle and poured directly through the strainer.

To be able to monitor my wines I usually put a hydrometer inside my fermenter.

For a lot of my previous wines, the SG has fallen from for example \~90 to \~10 in 14 days. However, with my current redcurrant wine, it is dropping extremely slowly.

"Stouts, Gravity, Refractometers, Maths... Help? I recently popped a Fundamental Observation from Bottle Logic, and while I'm not trying to clone it per se, it's in the range of flavor profile and mouthfeel I'd like to learn how to create.  I'd gotten a lot of great advice on here about stouts, but 5 brews later things just weren't connecting, so I saved a little from the bottle, let it go flat, then threw it on my refractometer....and saw it was at 25°!

I did some ""math"" (I played on a refractometer brix conversion calculator till I got it right), and figure if the bottle is 14.1% and the FG was 25°, that means the OG was 40.3° (according to the brewers friend refractometer calculator with a wort correction of 1)

Ok... so that kind of makes sense, except that going from the refractometer page on brewersfriend to their ABV calculator page and plugging in the gravity numbers given from brix conversions, it's showing a difference of 1.52% ABV .    Let me try to illustrate:  


**On the refractometer page (lines up with what I saw, and the bottle's stated ABV):**   
OG  :: 40.3°  \~  1.181  
FG  :: 25.0°  \~ 1.062  
WCF :: 1.00  
ABV :: 14.1%

**Plugging the gravities into the ABV Calculator Page:**   
OG :: 1.181  
FG  ::  1.062  
ABV :: 15.62%  (and it takes setting the OG to 1.170 to get close to the target ABV of 14.1%)

So all of that laid out, now I've got three questions:    
\------------------

1) What is going on with the varying ABVs between the refractometer and the ABV calculator using standard gravity ?

2) Which Original Gravity do I aim for when designing a grainbill :: the 1.181 or the 1.170?

3) Finally, and this one could be it's own thread, but I'm using Beersmith2 on an old computer to design the grainbill (I know I should update already, but in the meantime...).   My plan was to use my fermentable malts (base and caramel) to achieve the target ABV according to beersmith, then add in all the specialty malts (chocolate, carafe special III, and other low-fermentable malts with minimal actual ABV impact, so I'm ignoring their impact on ABV), and finally, use Carapils to raise the gravity until I hit the target for OG (ignoring how it impacts the ABV since in reality it wont), and then :: Is that design process right?",Homebrewing

Looked over at my pasteurized room temperature batch that got done bottle carbing last week and decided I wanted to make it a little sweeter because it almost tastes more like a sparking wine.  Popped it open and pssshhhhhhhhhhhttttttt all over the ceiling.. the walls.. all over me and my wife. We laughed. I threw one in thr fridge to test in a few days outside. I hope the cold one doesn't do the same. :)",Homebrewing
"Added fancy rotating racking arms to my plastic fermenter &amp; bottling bucket. Because why not? Cheaper than buying stainless ;) [https://imgur.com/a/DlnZ538](https://imgur.com/a/DlnZ538) 

I guess I'm finally getting OCD with how much I can extract out of my plastic fermenters/bottling bucket, and am getting tired of tipping them to get the last bits out... still with trub.  

I probably *really* should have checked here first, but I bought a pair of these here: [https://www.ontariobeerkegs.com/S\_S\_2\_Piece\_Ball\_Valve\_With\_Racking\_Arm\_1\_2\_NPT\_p/2pc-ball-valve-racking-arm.htm](https://www.ontariobeerkegs.com/S_S_2_Piece_Ball_Valve_With_Racking_Arm_1_2_NPT_p/2pc-ball-valve-racking-arm.htm)

But, as I learned once I got them, the ports in my plastic fermenters is 1"" across, while the OD of these 1/2"" threads is (clearly) smaller: So gaps and leaks:  Had to pick up these washers from McMaster-Carr, and this sorted it: [https://www.mcmaster.com/99604A129/](https://www.mcmaster.com/99604A129/)

"Saffron Orange NEIPA As the title says, im making a saffron neipa. Its christmas soon. And here in sweden saffron is used in pretty much everything when christmas comes. So I was thinking I would try to make a Saffron Neipa. As this is abit of a experiment, I couldn't find alot online as to when to add the saffron. I will not keg this beer, so by kegging is out of the question. And I know that this may be a bad experiment as the hops may take over and the saffron will just linger in the back and make some kind of an off flavor. But i guess this is what experiments are for.

"Batch size, dry hopping amount, slightly confusing terminology I’ve always been slightly confused about this, but I’ve never bothered to ask until now. When people refer to batch size that could mean a whole lot of different things such as the amount they end up kegging, or the amount going into the fermenter, or the amount in their kettle post boil. Usually I can scale the recipe to what I have as my equipment to reach the OG / FG. 

However the hops are still confusing to me. For example on a recent episode of Experimental Brewing, Scott Janish mentioned that sapwood cellars likes to whirlpool with about 2 pounds per barrel. What is it exactly? Is it 2 pounds per barrel of wort that ultimately makes it into the fermenter? Or 2 pounds per barrel of the stuff they are actually able to keg? Those could definitely be a lot different depending on hop absorption and losses. Same question applies to dry hop amount. 

I’ve seen quite a few recipes where the batch size is the post boil volume. The person who wrote the recipe could be potentially leaving behind a gallon or more of stuff behind… But I don’t know that. What should I be doing with the amount of hops that they specify for the recipe say I am targeting 5 gallons into my fermenter. Hope this makes sense.",Homebrewing

"PSA: For those new to kegging! So I've just moved from the laborious task of bottling me beer to the exciting world of corny kegs. Everything arrived today so as soon as I got back from work, I excitedly put together the gas, regulator, and keg. Now something I hadn't realised, as to be honest it seems totally counter-intuitive, is that the tighter you adjust the regulator the more gas it lets through. So in my naivity I tightened it as much as I could connected everything up (including the gas input) and turned on the gas. Immediately the pressure shot up on the regulator hitting 60psi and gas started blowing out the safety valve. So between filling my trousers and shouting to my girlfriend that the loud sound of gas escaping is perfectly fine, I managed to disconnect the gas before the lid blew off the corny keg. So this is just a quick note to all the other newbs out there, *anti*-clockwise (or loosening) is off on a regulator and clockwise (tight) is fully on!",Homebrewing

"Is it possible to predict % of OG that is unfermentables from crystal malts? This is one thing that I’ve always struggled with. When designing a darker beer with crystal malts, I never know what the FG will be. 

I recently brewed a beer with a pound of chocolate malt, quarter pound of C120, and a quarter pound of C60. Using Voss Kveik, I ended up with an attenuation of 60%. It’s a kveik, these things are typically 80% attenuation or even higher sometimes. But if a sugar isn’t fermentable, then they won’t eat it of course. Brewers Friend of course just takes the predicted attenuation and spits out an FG, but that was way false. 

So, is there a method to determine how many points of your OG is non-fermentable based on Lovibond and weight per grain type?",Homebrewing

"Cold crashing dryhops failing Hi all,

I have a problem I have not been able to find answer anywhere. I have dry hopped loose 2 times on my kegmenter. Both of those times I have left 5+ liters in the kegmenter because it simply won't come out with pressure and diptube. What could be the answer?

Some facts:
-I have cold crashed for 2 days in 2-4C
-in my 16 l batches I get out 8 liters or after that nothing comes out
-I checked the ball locks they were empty
-I checked the diptube nothing in it either
-after 2 days of dry hopping I shaked the kegmenter to get liquid on top of the hops at the top, but nothing still out of the diptube after waiting 20h
-I have kegmenter and diptube that came with the kegmenter pressure set
-when I opened the fermenter last time I got few more liters out with siphon

I am really disappointed because I hear people with good result with loose dryhopping and I really would like to continue with that. What could be the solution?

"New-ish all-grain brewer looking for recipe suggestions (BIAB) I recently brewed my first two batches (5 gal) with a BIAB setup, an amber ale and a cream ale. The cream was my first and had some off flavours, kind of like an old beer aftertaste. I am not sure if this would be oxidation or possibly the fact that there were likely chloramines in the water. The amber will be getting kegged and carbonated later this week but I skipped secondary and added 1/2 campden tablet to the brew water so hopefully it tastes a bit better.

"Sous vide for secondary additions? About to move my vanilla porter to the secondary fermenter.  I've had the vanilla beans (sliced lengthwise and scraped) soaking in bourbon for a week.  I've read that the longer they soak, the better.  Then I remembered the limoncello I made this summer. 

Traditionally, lemon zest is immersed in clear liquor (vodka, everclear) for about 3 weeks. I followed a recipe that shortened that to 3 hours with a sous vide at 135F / 57C.  It turned out incredible.

"Irish Car Bomb Stout? So a goal of mine is to make a stout with the flavor of an irish car bomb without having to slam it because it will quickly curdle.

For those (I can't imagine there are many) who don't know what an irish car bomb is, you take a half pint of guinness, and drop in a shot of half jameson and half irish cream. Promptly slam it down.

My home brew idea is to infuse a bottle of jameson for a few weeks with vanilla beans, a few cocoa nibs, and a few espresso beans to get an irish cream flavor going, and then brew a milk stout with lactose for a nice creamy mouth feel, add the infused whiskey to the bottling bucket before priming and bottling.

Question 1... Is this idea feasible or is there a better way anyone would suggest to get the desired flavor?

Question 2... How much whiskey is enough/too much? I figured that in a 5 gallon batch (640 oz), the equivalent of one shot per pint in an actual car bomb would be around 40 oz. That is a LOT of whiskey. So I thought one 750ml bottle would suffice to give a good flavor to the stout and not overdo the alcohol.",Homebrewing
