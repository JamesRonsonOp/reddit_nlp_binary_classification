Boosting ABV with table sugar,"Boosting ABV with table sugar I’ve read about boosting ABV with table sugar / other sugars, and decided to add 1lb of table sugar directly to my fermenter for a high ABV milk stout.

I’m thinking I probably should have dissolved the sugar some warm water first like I do for bottling. Are the yeast going to ignore all of the sugar, since I watched it just drop to the bottom of my carboy, or will they get to it anyways?

Is this pellicile or yeast?,"Is this pellicile or yeast? For some background, this is apple cider fermented with red star champaigne yeast. It has sat in primary fermentor for 2 weeks. Original gravity was 1.060 and current gravity is 0.990. Disinfected with campden tablets and added some pectinase.

A few days ago I went to take a closer look after all the foam from juicing the apple with a juicer that had subsided/eaten up by the yeast/fell out to the bottom and I noticed that there was this super thin film like thing on top. It doesnt look infected like other photos I went to search online and it doesnt have any off smells or tastes on sampling.

What should I do now?

Troubleshooting oxidization in keg,"Troubleshooting oxidization in keg Howdy - I’m trying to troubleshoot what I suspect is an oxidization problem with my last two kegged beers. I can’t pressure transfer due to my fermenter, but this has been my process for a dozen prior brews, non of them exhibited this issue. 

Clean and sanitize keg, put on gas and fill with co2, purge multiple times, pop the top just enough to get the beer line in, gravity feed the beer into the keg, gas on, purge a few more times. The only variable has been I got new CO2 from airgas.

Last two beers, one a kolsch, one a spiced holiday dark beer, both tasted fine on day 1 &amp; 2, but by day 3 they were bitter, wet cardboard tasting. The prior batches were almost exclusively West Coast IPA and NEIPA, and I never had an issue with what should be more volatile brews. 

I’ve also torn down my entire draft system, cleaned it all and put it back together after the last batch.

Any troubleshooting would be hugely appreciated.",Homebrewing

Plastic Taste After Priming?,"Plastic Taste After Priming? Recently finished a Holiday Spiced Ale from Northern Brewer (it’s basically a Scottish Ale with Mulling Spice). It was an extract kit. I tasted it every step of the way and didn’t notice anything off. About 2 weeks ago I racked into a bottling bucket (this is the only time the beer has been in anything plastic) and added my table sugar (boiled in 2 cups of water, cooled and added to the beer). Then bottled and let it sit in the basement. It was in the bucket maybe 30 minutes tops. Popped one open today - perfectly carbonated - but it has a very plastic aftertaste. Could it have been the bucket? I would assume if it was my water I would have noticed the taste before this, but this is my first brew, so what do I know ;) I’m also reading Brett can cause a plastic/bandaid flavor. It’s very subtle, but it’s there. 

I cleaned everything with C-Brite and sterilized with Star-San. Fermented in a glass carboy. Could it work itself out or should I just make beer soap with all this?",Homebrewing

Help with Lagers,"Help with Lagers So I've been brewing for a long time, but lately I've noticed that my lagers come out ""yeasty"" (quotes for a reason). I have a Czech pils on tap right now which has the same issue, though otherwise good. For Christmas I filled a gallon keg to take to my father and a 16 oz twistee to ship to my brother. Because of the size of the keg, my father and I drank it at about 45°F (outside temperature that day) and it tasted amazingly crisp. I asked my brother and he said he only detected a faint off flavor that he only noticed because I asked him to look for it.

Some details: initial fermentation at 50°F, raised to 64°F after 5 days for a 4 day rest, then lagered at 30-35°F for about 4-5 weeks. OG 1.054, FG 1.009 using Wyeast 2278. After filling the keg and can, they sat on the counter overnight at 65-70°F.

So I am wondering if maybe I have been having DMS issues and not realizing it because I wasn't good at identifying it, or if somehow the off gassing during filling scrubbed some kind of off flavor? I just drank a beer off the tap and it still had the ""yeasty"" flavor that might just be DMS. 

But if this is DMS, then why isn't my 4 day rest enough? Why does it seem to not be there when I sample during kegging? I had become convinced I had oxidation issues during cold crashing, but now I am not so sure.

Anyone have any opinions or input?",Homebrewing

HomeCraft Mini Keg,"HomeCraft Mini Keg So my wife bought me a HomeCraft mini keg for Christmas. 5l capacity. Nice gift considering my wife knows I enjoy making home brew and she doesn’t know a lick about it. 

So this keg comes with little co2 cartridges, and a non pressurized growler. I always bottle condition my beer. I have zero experience with this kind of stuff, and am having little luck finding anything about this product with home brewers.

Can I just add my fermented beer to this 5l growler, let it cool, add co2 and ready to drink? I know keg conditioning is a thing, but I don’t know how in the hell I am supposed to with this thing.

Would be annoying to have to bottle condition beer just to transfer it to a separate growler after the fact.

I know I can buy a pressurized mini keg, is this the route I’m gonna have to go? Considering they only cost 10-20 dollars, it isn’t a big deal. I’m just trying to figure out how in the hell I can make this thing compatible with my own home made batches.

"Homebrew Club organization - Help, I've just been made president of my club","Homebrew Club organization - Help, I've just been made president of my club Howdy,

As the title states, I have just been made president of my local club. And I mean just a matter of hours ago.  I haven't even spoken with the Board or new VP yet.

Until recently our club was using a mix of a Yahoo groups mailing list, Facebook, and our own website for club communications.  Yahoo groups is/has gone away, and not everybody uses Facebook.  I'm looking for a good solution for two way communications that everyone in the club can use.  Ideally, I guess, that would be email communications.

Beyond the problems with privacy and data security that come with Facebook, I would like to limit this primary communication tool to some service that doesn't require an intrusive account set up (if that makes sense). Like many clubs we have a large number of members that I don't believe would sign up for a message board/forum (though I would like to have one for our members that would use one.)

It finished with a pretty darn high gravity in the fermenter, but it stalled out and showed no changes over an additional week when I had it in the bucket.  Seeing no FG changes, I decided to bottle.  But, the other night upon opening the bottle, I was greeted with a black-brown geyser of beer.  The little bastards in there kept eating away at the sugar in my supposed syrupy dessert beer!  

It was quite the letdown when I went to pop a bottle open in front of a crowd on Christmas' eve...first an Earth-shattering \*POP\*, several seconds of anticipation, and then a beer geyser from the bottle!  

After pouring out the remaining beer in the bottle, I found a lovely and fairly strong maple - chocolate - coffee (?) stout.  More bitter than a Guinness on the first sip, but a warmth of chocolate comes over and finishes with a gentle maple taste.  Completely different to the hooch it was several months ago!

I've been venting the beers every hour or so on my down time to defuse the bombs they've become.  It's dangerously delicious.

I have an unpopular preference that requires an innovative solution.,"I have an unpopular preference that requires an innovative solution. Let's cut to it... I like certain beers at or around room temperature. Particular wheats, spicy porters, or hoppier barley wines, to name a few. That's my preference, and I accept the fact I'm in the minority.

That aside: I have a repurposed fridge kegerator. 10lbs tank, 3 way manifold, and several kegs I swap out as things happen (Usually 5gal corny ball, and two 2.5gal torpedos stacked). To keep 5gal room temp, I swapped one of the faucets with a gas in, set the keg outside the fridge, and popped a picnic tap on it. Problem is, I'm not sure how to plug up the space between what was my 7/8"" faucet and is now my 9/16"" tube. I just have a bunch of extra rubber gloves and electrical tape stuffed in it, right now.

Is there a smarter way to do this, or an adapter? I don't always want a room temp beer, but on such an occasion I make something I'd prefer to be such, I'd like a quick way to swap one in or out.",Homebrewing

First time home brewer seeking advice.,"First time home brewer seeking advice. Hi y’all. I recently began brewing my first batch of beer. It’s a humble 1-gallon setup from a kit, which is supposed to produce a single-hop IPA. My wort has been in the carboy for approximately 36 hours, and I haven’t noticed any significant fermentation activity yet. Checked it at around 12 and 24 hours too. 

The kit came with an airlock, but instructed the user not to put it on until after “a few days,” once fermentation has died down. So for now it just has a rubber stopper with a tube leading into a half-full glass of water (can DM pictures if this would help). Setup is in my basement, where the temperature stays around 50-60 degrees fahrenheit.

The annual tradition of canning 5 gallons of starter.,"The annual tradition of canning 5 gallons of starter. Every year I can 5 gallons of starter wort. It takes a few hours, and is perfect to do over Christmas, because there's a lot of sitting around anyway. [Here's the process in action](https://i.imgur.com/DGoT5tJ.jpg)

This is my technique:

* 7.5 pounds of 2-row
* Collect 7 gallons of water.
* Add 10 quarts of 168-170 degree water, and mash in. Target temp is 150 degrees, lower is better.
* Collect the first runnings
* Sparge with 2.0 gallons of water
* Sparge again with 2.5 gallons water until 5 gallons is reached.


The boil
* I usually boil for 15-20 mins to get some of the sulfur compounds to evolve off.


Canning:
* I can in 1/2 gallon jars, and optionally, add 1/2 teaspoon of yeast nutrient to the jars before canning.
* Can at 15 pounds for 15 minutes.
* Cool, ensure the seal is good (test the dimple in the top to ensure it's depressed), and store in safe place.",Homebrewing

Farmhouse ale recipe help,"Farmhouse ale recipe help Happy holidays all.  I was gifted some equipment that I can finally dedicate to mixed fermentations, and I have been itching to make a farmhouse ale with Omega C2C saison/Brett yeast.  

I will likely stray from style guidelines in some ways, but I’d like to stay true to the idea of the yeast and Brett being the stars of the show in terms of flavor.  I would like to add at least some citrus/fruit flavor via hopping with Motueka.

My grain bill is going to be 70% Pilsner, 18% spelt, and 11% flaked wheat.  For a 5 gallon batch, I was going to shoot for 16IBUs with 0.75 oz of Motueka at 10 mins and 5 mins, and then do a whirlpool with 1.5 oz of Motueka.  No dry hop.  

Does this sound like a hopping schedule that will give a hint of Motueka’s flavor while letting the yeast do their thing?  I almost exclusively brew NEIPAs so I am just used to hopping at extreme rates.

New Setup Help (fermenter questions),"New Setup Help (fermenter questions) I've been brewing off and on since 2012. My current setup involves a propane burner that I use outside with a 10 gallon pot, an 8 gallon pot for heating water, a water cooler mash tun and 3 6.5 gallon glass carboys and 3 5 gallon glass carboys. Why so many carboys? I don't know. I think I got some as a gift.

Anyway, I want to get away from the carboys. Cleaning the auto siphon stinks. Worrying about when I need to replace the siphon because of possible contamination causes me anxiety. 

I've done some research into cost effective alternatives and I seem to have landed on the Anvil 7.5 gallon stainless steel bucket fermenters. My problem is that I still think I'd need to use the 5 gallon carboys I have to dry hop in secondary. As alternatives I've looked at dry hopping in the keg, but that's not very appealing to me. I'm not sure how else I'd do it, though, without buying a smaller stainless fermenter (which Anvil sells a 4 gallon.... not quite big enough), or upgrading to a true conical like the SS Brewtech, Anvil, or Spike.

Things that I don't do now that I might want to in the future would be washing yeast and temp control beyond a wet t-shirt...

Yeast Harvest from Conicals.,"Yeast Harvest from Conicals. Hello and happy holidays! I recently (three months ago) switched to grainfather conical fermenters. I'm thoroughly enjoying them but only recently started using them to harvest yeast. 

My question is does it matter if I just pull a healthy looking slug out of the middle of the cone, or do I really need to wash it? I've pulled great samples of some 1056 wyeast from the dump valve, and have just been pitching them straight up. The fermentations have started within 12 hours, and the beers have been great, very strong and coming to full attenuation within 7-10 days. I don't let the yeast sit in fridge for more than a week or so. Obviously my method is working, I'm just wondering if I'm introducing off flavors etc. 

I am well aware the slugs will carry hoppy flavors from IPAs etc, but if I am jumping from one beer to another the same ish style does it really matter? Pale ale to IPA, porter to stout etc.

Javoru Yeast Hard Cider,"Javoru Yeast Hard Cider [Jovaru Hard Cider ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ih7CD1h)

Word to the wise. Jovaru is a phenomenal yeast for hard cider. Down side is it takes forever to flocc our. It’s finally looking clear after two and a half months. It also takes a longer than normal to ferment out. It was steadily bubbling for at least three weeks. 

It ferments bone dry but the yeast gives off a ton of glycerol, making it seem sweeter and bodied. It also holds onto a ton of acid “which is awesome for cider” which is even more crucial when working with juice made from eating apples. This batch was made with Northern Spy, Jonathan &amp; Ida’s.",Homebrewing

Long time brewer...first time souring.,"Long time brewer...first time souring. I did quite a bit of research on kettle souring (using Goodbelly juice), and decide to give it a shot.  Brew day went well, transferred to boil kettle, boiled 10 min, and cooked quickly to 95F.  I went to pre-acidify the wort down to a target of about 4.5 ph, but ran short of lactic acid and ended up around 5.2ish.  By now I was committed,  so I pitched a quart of Goodbelly, blanketed with CO2, and covered top of kettle.  about 48hrs later, and PH is only down to about 4.15....looking to get to 3.2 to 3.6 range.

I started to rebuild my brewery to feature HERMS and automation with BruControl.,"I started to rebuild my brewery to feature HERMS and automation with BruControl. I thought I'd share some of the process here.
I bought two new 15 gal kettles from Ss Brewtech and had BrewPi's coils and heating elements put into it. Punching out the holes for the elements and coil was nerve wrecking, but it turned out fine and does not leak, as far as I can tell.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CIlkFRVlJ0T/?igshid=1ntr0fds4ri8s

Now I am designing the electrical enclosure. I'm using a 16x8x6 electrical enclosure cabinet/wall box. I needed an enclosure that was not too deep, as the kettle will be in front of it and I do not have too much space on my walls anymore.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CI-9Z5VF5Of/?igshid=b62u3cmnmgdr

When wiring the enclosure I've taken much care into wiring with thick enough cables, so that in theory I can just upgrade with a juicier element when I want without rewiring. I use 40A SSRs, even though the elements are about 13A. If I decide to switch elements I'll have to change wires throughout the house so that is a future job. 

I've painted the enclosure black so it does not stand out too much, and I'm planning to add indicator lights on the side so that I can see when the elements are firing, and also turn them off manually for cleaning. I'd like to avoid circumstances where they dry fire or fire during cleaning. I'm going to look for a smaller 12v power supply unit, to make room for two smaller contactors to control elements independently.

"Ol man bought a basic ale kit and shipped it to me for xmas, thought I'd make a post because I have a few questions about brewing in general","Ol man bought a basic ale kit and shipped it to me for xmas, thought I'd make a post because I have a few questions about brewing in general Hope all I have to say is allowed, new to beer brewing and since I have a busy day and wont be able to spend quality time researching the many questions on my mind. Going to do my best to make them broad and not heavily specific in Hope's for a well thought out list of answers and advice

So this kit is from the company craft a brew, a 1 gallon brown ale starting kit. Havent started it just yet, waiting for xmas which is my next day off. No real questions about the kit itself, 

the questions I have are about what styles of beer work best for aging? I want to age some brews once I get the hang of brewing. And dont want to waste a batch learning the hard way. Especially when it comes to ales. 3-5 litre aging barrels arent terribly expensive online so doesnt hurt to experiment outside of what I've used one for in the past...which was aging London dry gin.....which is not too bad, worth trying if you're not a gin drinker

What is easier to brew and more difficult amongst every style of beer? I just dont want to get a difficult recipe going and discourage myself from brewing 

Adding flavor beyond the grains and sweeteners, for fruits do I mash them up and add it to the mix or cut them, or leave whole, or which ones per types of fruit since a raspberry and apple are completely different

Do you add extra yeast if you want to try and go for a 8-12% abv? 

Honey, maple syrup, agave nectar and other natural non sugar sweeteners, how much would be too much in a recipe that doesnt call for sweet ingredients such as what I listed

Replacing water with tea or coffee, or even sap, how would that work out on a 100% substitution? 

Adding herbs and spices. Is that even a thing?

And most importantly, as far as ales are concerned, how long is too long for fermentation, as well as aging?

I have some unique ideas going on in my head about what would I add or substitute ontop of a generic recipe to create the perfect ale for me. I love all types of ales, some more than others. This gift I hope ends up becoming a regular hobby, I've never brewed beer before, I've only brewed mead and it was simple and pretty good for only doing it once. 

Growlers, kegs/barrels, cans, jars or regular bottles with a capping machine, what is ideal, or cost effective, best for preserving longer than like a couple months? I definitely want to try every logical means of storage, however not sure which I should invest in first. All batches after my 1st from this kit I want to store them and not drink it all like a thirsty drunk lol

I think my Brew Jacket's Jacket is wrong,"I think my Brew Jacket's Jacket is wrong My wife got me a Brew Jacket for Xmas.

I typically brew in carboys or buckets, and the box for this thing says it's for bucket/'carboy brewing.

Perhaps I'm an idiot (the wife would say I am), but the jacket that came with it doesn't seem right to me.  There's the circular zipper end on it that's the bottom, right?  The top end, the end with the drawstring has no opening.  It's a nylon fabric chimney that's about as long as the ""insulated bucket"" part of the jacket.

"Building ""high-end"" homebrewery - looking for setup recommendation","Building ""high-end"" homebrewery - looking for setup recommendation Hello Everyone,

I've been brewing for a couple of years while upgrading my equipment here and there. At the moment, I use a 10 Gal MLT setup (for 5-6Gal batches), which I'm very comfortable with. I have 2x 7Gal fermentors (one anvil-like stainless, one Fermzilla). As the title suggests, I'm looking to GREATLY improve my brewing and I have a decent budget to spend. I'm looking for additional pros and cons on certain elements I'd like to purchase, and recommendations of pro homebrewers that were in my shoes earlier in their career.

My goal would be to brew bigger batches with precise temperature control. On the cold side, I'm looking to experiment with yeasts comparison and aging comparison. I'm looking to both keg and bottle. I'm not that interested in bottle conditioning; I already own a Tapcooler counter pressure filler and I would prefer to use it. Cleaning wise, I'd like to CIP everthing.

The first piece I'm eyeing is the Grainfather G70. Electric brewing seems A+ here and I believe my hot side will be covered. My question resides more on the cold side of the thing. As the G70 brews &gt;40L batches, I need more fermentors (either 14Gal or 2x 7Gal per batch). 

This is where my hesitation resides.  For my interest; yeasts comparison sounds like a 2x 7 Gal thing and the aging comparison looks like a 1 x 14Gal one then split in two carboys. If I were to use plastic Fermzilla things, well it would be a no-brainer and I'd just buy everything, but I'm looking for more sturdy gear (like SS from ss brewtech or spike?). I can handle a little bit of DIY but I'd rather spend a few more $ than having a highly custom setup.

The ""pretty-sure"" thing are

\- G70

\- Glycol Chiller (around 1/3 hp) 

The ""what should I do"" things are

\- 1x 14 Gal Unitank or,

\- 2x 7 gal Unitank or,

\- 1x 14 Gal Unitank + 2x ss brewbucket (and do the priming via kegs?) then purchase 7 gal unitank later or, 

\- or ... ?

My thought process is stuck and I feel I miss the pros and cons to weigh my decision. Also if you have a totally different approach for the same problem feel free to pitch in.

I was recently gifted a Mangrove Jack's Dutch Lager kit (the malt in a can kind) by some mates who are aware I'm into homebrewing. I've made meads before, as well as an awful Red Bull experiment, but this is my first time brewing beer. 

I decided to use some Brewmaster Premium Brewblend 10, and Morgan's Premium Lager Yeast. Unfortunately, due to my experience with brewing and the fact that I don't really drink beer much, I completely ignored the fact that lagers are fermented at low temperatures.

The yeast is rated for around 12C ideal, 15C max, but I'll be at around 23C. While I'm not *too* worried (RDWHAHB and all), I'm curious what effects it'll have. Will it not perform at all, or will it cause strange flavors?

Using a kegerator freezer compartment as glycol chiller?,"Using a kegerator freezer compartment as glycol chiller? Hello,

I have a fridge I've converter into a kegerator and use the fridge compartment to store the kegs and yeast. I also use the freezer compartment to store the hops, but it's mostly empty since I don't stock that much hops.

I've been wondering if I could add a glycol deposit and a pump on the freezer compartment and use that to chill my fermenter (6gal max). I could fit a 20L glycol reservoir which will sit at -18C. Will this be enough to drop the temperature of the fermenter 20 or 30C? Is it fine to run glycol at -18C through the fermenter coil? Will I burn my fridge engine if the glycol gets too hot?

I'm not finding much info on people having done this, so any feedback appreciated!

post-boil wort cooling with a fan with lid on?,"post-boil wort cooling with a fan with lid on? For most of the last five years, once my boil was over, I'd get some oven mitts on and lug my near-boiling wort inside and up some stairs to the kitchen that I was hooking my immersion chiller up to.  This past spring, I decided it was a great time to retire that method.  I got lucky never dumping six gallons of boiling liquid all over myself but it is totally something that could happen.  So far, I've just hooked my immersion chiller up to a hose hookup outside.  Now that it's actually cold out, I've turned that faucet off from the inside.  I also wouldn't want to ice up my driveway that bad.

To make a short story long, has anybody that lives in a cold climate had success putting the lid on the pot and just pointing some fans at the pot?  The air I would be blowing at the pot would be significantly colder than any water I've ever used in an immersion chiller.  The downside is I won't be able to gently stir it like I do with my immersion chiller.  I really want the lid on because the fans will likely pick debris up from the garage floor and let it fly into the wort.  I do some pretty vigorous boils so I'm not super worried about DMS for the cooling period unless it drags on for much longer than my immersion chiller would take.

I've tried setting my pot in a snowbank before but it doesn't work nearly as well as you'd think.  The pot melts the snow touching the sides of the pot immediately, leaving an air gap that I'm sure provides some insulation from the rest of the snow.",Homebrewing
Please criticize my first attempt at making cider/alcohol!,"Please criticize my first attempt at making cider/alcohol! Hello everyone,

I have recently tried making cider for the first time and would like some feedback on my recipe/methods/etc. since I'm only mildly satisfied with my first attempt.

The Recipe: - I kept this very simple for my first attempt.

4.5 gallons of Treetop ""3 apple blend"" apple juice.
1 tsp Pectin Enzyme (for clarity)
5 tsp Yeast Nutrient
1 Packet of Lalvin K1-V1116 yeast
No sugar/sweetener added. OG: 1.048
Fermenting: - I let ferment for two weeks until I saw no activity in the carboy. Fermentation took place in a dark room around 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

FG: 1.000-1.002

Kegging/Racking: - I cold crashed for 24 hours for clarity. I then transferred the cider to a Corny Keg and backsweetened with 24oz of Treetop Apple juice concentrate with 1/4 tsp Potassium Meta-Bisulfate and 2.5 tsp of Potassium Sorbate.

I then let sit at cellar temperatures (45 degrees Fahrenheit) and let sit at 16 psi for two weeks. It's okay. My friend described it having a ""vomit taste"" which I can pick up on a tiny bit. It has a bit of acidity that is very prominent at warmer temps, but it's not undrinkable, I'm curious if that's because the K1-V1116 champagne yeast... I'm drinking it at cellar temp and it's not bad, but nothing exciting or ""great"" by any means.

It's a little too sweet for my taste, I regret adding 24oz of juice concentrate instead of the 12oz I originally intended, but I can live with it.

When I try this again I plan on letting it ferment for at least another week, adding some sugar initially to boost the gravity slightly, and maybe using a different yeast (S-04?) and probably adding a different flavor of juice to back sweeten, but I'm not sure yet.

Any advice/feedback based on my first attempt? I'm not upset, but I am slightly disappointed. I was hoping for something a bit more enjoyable. Thank you!",Homebrewing

But a couple days ago, I tried juicing a bunch of oranges and pomegranates I had lying around, but just juiced them and didn’t pasteurise it, but otherwise went through the same process as the cider, with one other exception. This time, the morning after I pitched my yeast, I stirred all the foamy stuff and bits of pulp that rose up and stuck to the walls of the fermenter, back into the mash. All seemed to be going well, with the airlock bubbling away all day and night. Then this morning, after I woke up, I stirred it all up again, cuz the pulp had settled at the bottom, and I wanted to make sure the yeast had all their nutrients and the flavour of the fruit would continue to blend. But after I sealed it back up, it stopped fermenting entirely. No pressure showing at the airlock. Should I not have stirred it? Do the yeast just need their alone time, once they get started? Or did they actually completely finish? I find the latter option a bit hard to believe, since the apple batch was bubbling for about a week, but this one was only 2 nights and a day. I used the same yeast each time, and it’s almost the same quantity of liquid, though a little less sugar in this batch (1080 for the cider, and 1070 for this one). Granted, it’s also a liter or two less liquid, and it’s a turbo yeast, but the difference of 5 days of bubbling seems too big to ignore. I have not yet checked the gravity reading since it stopped, as I want to leave it until morning, just in case, so I will check to see the sugar content tomorrow.
But in the meantime, does anyone have any input/thoughts?
It would suck if this batch was bad, cuz all that juicing was a lot of work",Homebrewing
How long do you reuse yeast slurry for?,"How long do you reuse yeast slurry for? A few years ago i used to freeze my yeast in test tubes with glycerin. It was time consuming. And always required a starter. But took up very little space.

Over the last couple years I’ve gotten lazy. I’ve since got a few different yeasts that i use time and time again... a yeast for wheat beers, a yeast for ales, a yeast for NE ipa’s, and a yeast for mead. 

I’ve been storing part of the yeast cakes in a sanitized pint jars in my fridge. When it comes time to brew, i re-suspend the yeast/trub by shaking the jar and let the it come to room temp before pitching the whole damn thing. 

I don’t bother with washing yeast like i did years ago. All my hops during the boil go in a larger mesh basket. I do all my dry hoping in bags/cages. 

I have some yeast I’ve reused 10x times. Still going strong.

Combining Yeast Packet and Starter from Can.... Question,"Combining Yeast Packet and Starter from Can....

Why I'm asking: I'm trying to clone Maine Beer Co, a tiny beautiful something, and through some research and speaking with their head brewer about a year ago at a brew fest, I've found that MBC use a chico strain like white labs WLP001 (california ale yeast), but repurposes yeast from their Peeper batches to make all their other beers. So, what I did is drive down to their brewery today and bought 3 bottles of Peeper to culture the yeast, but I also bought a packet of WLP001 in case the starter didn't work. I was thinking of pitching both the yeast starter cultured from the bottles and the WLP001, and was wondering if anyone has done the same (in a similar fashion) with any success? Happy to share any additional info on my upcoming brew day.

Kegged IPA won't carbonate,"Kegged IPA won't carbonate I have an IPA on tap that I kegged 2 weeks ago and it hasn't carbonated at all. I think I've had this issue with the last several IPAs I've kegged. Meanwhile other beers seem to be carbonating just fine. I have a cider on tap that I kegged *after* the IPA and it's well on its way to being fully carbed. 

Here are some details to help with troubleshooting:

* Keezer is kept at 34°F and the regulator is set to 12 psi
* I have verified that the keg does not leak and CO2 is entering the keg (when I pull the PRV a nice blast of 12psi CO2 comes out, and when I pour myself a sample of the IPA I can hear the CO2 entering the keg to replace the beer I poured) 
* This IPA (and my others) is dry hopped in the keg by suspending a mesh bag with pellet hops from the underside of the keg lid. Could this possibly be keeping CO2 from staying in solution? Seems unlikely given the keg is a sealed and pressurized system... but bagged dry hops are a unique and common variable that applies only to the IPAs I keg, and these are the only ones I have carb issues with. 
* No leaks anywhere in my kegging setup and the CO2 tank isn't empty

Lower ABV than expected,"Lower ABV than expected Hello all!

Were in the late stages of fermentation on the first beer we've ever brewed. We're doing a pre-made kit using Wyeast 3068.

The kit is a grainfather G30 with graincape and an SS brewtech Brewbucket and a plaato airlock.
We made sure to sanitize everything very properly before airating the wort by splashing it in the Brewbucket from a height we found acceptable. We pitched the yeast with the same temperature as the wort after the counterflow chiller (+-19 degrees c).

Our OG was 1.057 for a recipe that asked for 1.055. Our brewday was a bit odd. We lost about 3L during mashing, making a 19L pre-sparge batch into a 16L one, we sparged with about 4,5-5L according the recipe. Boiling about 65 minutes, adding the Tettnang hops 20 minutes into the boil.

However, after 4 days in the fermenter our gravity is reading 1.027 with almost no activity in the airlock. The sample smells like a weizen, has a hint of banana in there (which is exactly what we aimed for) and looks cloudy, without any trub.

Is it possible we have a lower ABV than expected due to under pitching?",Homebrewing

Is my hard cider ruined or still okay?,"Is my hard cider ruined or still okay? About five years ago I made my first batch of hard cider and today I revisited it thinking age may turn what was a rough first attempt in to something a little more palatable. 

Cracked it open and it still has carbonation since, before bottling, I added a pinch of plain sugar.

Unfortunately it still tastes much of the same from what I remember It doesn't taste great but, IIRC, the gravity suggested it was around 11% so maybe that's just the way it's suppose to be but definitely wasn't vinegar. 

That being said, I noticed it's clearer and that there are clumps/a layer of something which is on the bottom. I gave these bottles a nice scrub with the ""pink stuff"" prior to bottling and I took the measures needed to not have it go wild so I suspect it's either yeast which has crashed over the years or maybe even an infection but don't have the know how to know.

My brother is an experienced home distiller with many years of experience under his belt. His work has been featured in the local Californian newspapers, Wine Enthusiast Magazine, the NY Times, and other publications. Westbay is currently retired, but caries on the passion of distilling. In his book he takes you through the basics of making great Whiskey, Whisky &amp; Bourbon from the comfort of your own home. His guidebook helps you explores the critical science in plenty of detail to carry on your whiskey distilling efforts.

My brother put together a nice book back in 2018, which the family has now finally managed to publish with some help of family friends.

Hope it’s okey to share this here!

2020 hops,"2020 hops What experiences have you guys had with 2020 crop-year hops so far? I have a standard single-hop IPA recipe that I like to brew repeatedly whenever I order hops in bulk (I buy 1# bags from YVH as soon as the year's harvest becomes available). Hop-wise the recipe is 0.5oz at 10min, 2.0oz at flameout, 2.5oz dry hop for 2 days, Chico yeast.

2019 Citra, for example, was pretty incredible in my opinion. Very tropical and pungent. Loads of flavor and aroma.

2020 Mosaic, on the other hand, is extremely meh and disappointing. Very little fruity or ""dank"" flavor, just kind of a medium-intensity generic west coast hop taste/aroma. Tastes like a mediocre craft beer from ten years ago.

Next up I'll be giving 2020 Citra a try, I hope it lives up to 2019 instead of being mediocre like this year's Mosaic. After that, 2020 El Dorado.

So I'm curious to see everyone throw out their experiences and see if there are any trends. Granted, there is probably big variety based on which harvest you're getting and how it is stored. I like to think that by ordering domestic hops in bulk from YVH I'm getting the best hops available to me as a homebrewer, but I don't really know if that's true.",Homebrewing

Recirculation Pump - How to use properly?,"Recirculation Pump - How to use properly? I had an awful brew day yesterday.

I was using my Anvil’s recirculating pump and in the manual it talks about a stuck dough. Did that happen? I had the limited to 50% so it wasn’t just flowing uncontrolled. My OG was also ridiculously low for what I was aiming for so I feel that played into it also.

Bummed out. Finally set up my kegerator and immediately had a huge failure.,"Bummed out. Finally set up my kegerator and immediately had a huge failure. I got my cheap Home Depot fridge (Magic Chef 4.4 cubic ft fridge) set up as a kegerator. The door wouldn't quite close with 2 kegs, so I made a little grove where the protruding keg was by digging out some insulation and it was fine. I got both my taps on the door, the tubing all plugged in, so I was ready to go.

I had one keg of beer. I had pressure fermented in the keg, and it held pressure fine, so I knew the keg was good. This was my very first time with kegs and co2, so I was a bit nervous. I had the regulator hooked up to the tank and then to a manifold and then the keg. The valves on The regulator and manifold all closed. I release the co2 from the tank. Regulator gauges go up. spray everything with starsan. Looks good. Open regulator valve. Spray again. Looks good. Open manifold valve to keg. Now there's a loud hissing from the keg. Not feeling good about the sound, but my research told me there would be noise when the keg is carbonating. Spray everything again. Seems okay. Pull some beer from the tap. Comes out fine, but the beer is, of course, kind if flat. Still worried about the hissing, but tell myself I'm just overthinking it. Make sure psi is set where I want, then I close the fridge and walk away.

That evening I go to check on it. No more hissing = good sign? Pull on the tap. Not a drop. regulator gauges at zero. Pull on keg release  valve and there is zero pressure in the keg. Nothing at all. Wherever the leak was, it has to be in the keg, and big enough to empty a 5lb tank in a few hours. Did I not put the disconnect on right? Until I get more co2 I won't know, but it's such a disheartening mishap, especially for a beginner. Maybe my starsan was old and not bubbly enough to indicate leaks. Should I use soapy water?

What can I do to keep my second attempt from turning out the same way?",Homebrewing

Delayed dry hopping in keg,"Delayed dry hopping in keg Hi

I might be brewing for an event in the coming year. I don't know how much free time I'll have for brewing, in the weeks and months leading up to said event. Therefore I was thinking about brewing the beers about 6 months in advance, and storing it in kegs. 

I wanted to brew 1 or 2 IPAs, but have read that the hop aroma might fade with time. I have also read about some guys dry hopping directly into the keg, using pellets in a hop bag. 

That got me thinking. 

I could postpone the dry hop until about a week before I need the beers. I would transfer the beer from one keg into another, that then contains the dry hop. I would probably have to do the transfer under pressure, but i don't think that should be at problem. 

Has anyone tried something similar? Or do you guys have any idea what to expect from this? 

Any advice would be appreciated.",Homebrewing

Topaz Pale Ale,"Topaz Pale Ale Hey All,

I'm a strong advocate for using simple recipes for finding your best process and getting the most from your ingredients. And I just recently did  a 4.8% pale ale that utilized only Topaz hops because I wanted to get a better understanding of it!

Here's the recipe:

Grist

9.5lb or 4.3kg (78.3%) Bohemian Pilsner Malt (Weyermann)

1lb or 453g (8.7%) Munich I (Weyermann)

1.5lb or 680g (13%) White Wheat Malt (Proximity)

Mash @ 156degF or #nice degC for 1hr


60 min boil

0.75oz or 21g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) at 30min for 16IBU

4oz or 113g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) at flameout for 40IBU

3oz or 85g Topaz 17.5%AA (YVH) Dryhop post-fermentation


Yeast

I used Omega Yeast Labs OYL-009 West Coast Ale II, but they don't produce this yeast on a homebrew level anymore. You can use Wyeast 1272 for similar results. I love this yeast for highly-hopped beers because it's clean fermented at low temps (65degF/18degC) or amps up fruity hops with esters at higher (70degF/21degC). I went with the higher end for this beer because of the hop choice.

OG 13.2degP or 1.054sg

FG 4.3degP or 1.017sg

This beer was good. It had a fullness that the hops gave after dry hopping. I've found that a lot of Australian hops like this and Galaxy give a beer a much fuller feeling and flavor. The aroma was smaller I think from the ABV, but it was very tropical with mango, coconut, pineapple while also having a spicy character that reminded me of cinnamon or clove.

Overall, I really liked this hop as it had many flavors going on. However, I think it would be best utilized with another tropical/citrus hop like Citra or Centennial. Several descriptions of Topaz mentioned more lychee flavors at higher gravities, which I obviously didn't mess with. So that's another thing you could play with for this hop, just making this recipe and bumping up the gravity to a 7+%ABV beer.

I'm here for questions and would love comments if you have experience with this hop and how it may have been different.

Happy Brewing!",Homebrewing

Stir bars in fermenters,"Stir bars in fermenters I was daydreaming about homebrewing and came up with a question I couldn't answer that I thought someone here might know.

I am setting up my starter, and 'best practice' suggests using a stir bar. My assumption is that this is to oxygenate the media and distribute the yeast. Why don't homebrewers or macro brewers use stir bars in fermenters for the same reasons? Wouldn't this also speed up brewing?

The only reason I can think of is that sometimes brewers are trying to get the off-flavors that come from slightly strained yeast. Any other thoughts?

TL;DR - why don't people use stir bars in fermenters?",Homebrewing

Homebrewing teacher here, and I'm looking forward to the much needed break coming up. I'll definitely be using some of my time off to brew, so I wanted to share my plans/recipes.

Ill be (hopefully) brewing 3 batches:

An extract version of a  Honey Patersbier recipe i made a few times:

3 lbs light DME
2 lbs wildflower honey
8oz biscuit malt
8oz honey malt
8oz Munich 10L malt

0.5oz nugget @ 45 minutes

WLP 570 Belgian Golden Ale (I usually use Imperial B63 Monastic but had to go with what my LHBS had).

A Rye Stout:

9 lbs 2-row
3 lbs Rye Malt
1 lbs flaked rye
12oz chocolate rye
8oz midnight wheat

For the hops, I'll probbaly use up some leftover Veterans blend or falconers flight I have, with additions at 60, 15, and FO. This could morph into a black IPA-ish beer as well. Shooting for around 40-50 IBUs. Fermented with US-05.

A kveik mexican ""lager:""

5 lbs 2-row
3 lbs flaked corn

0.2oz nugget @ 60 minutes, 0.5oz @ 5 minutes.

I may have mashed to high. What now?,"I may have mashed to high. What now? I started a Hefeweizen 2 days ago. After i added tilt hydrometer , i realized i had cooled way too much.... 52 deg F. Double checked the temp with a third thermometer and found it really was 52 deg. The first thermometer i had been using was off. 

Fermentation took off pretty quickly within 12 hrs and went from 1.056 to 1.035 over the next day. 

Today it sat at 1.035 all day. Airlock has been bubbling pretty quickly (few bubbles per second). But SG hasn’t budged. I even double checked with a standard hydrometer. 

So then i started rethinking things. I heat
my mash up with a digiboil; it does an okay job but i always double check it with another thermometer and it does occasionally overshoot the temp. 

I planned to mash at 154 (strike temp 160). It did overshoot to around 164 (according to digiboil). I took lid off and stirred a bit and let sit for 10-15 mins until the bad thermometer said 159 and then mashed in. So maybe it really wasn’t 159. The digiboil is usually correct within 5 deg. So i really don’t think the  i would have been over 165 after mashing in.

I've hit the the point in my brewing year where I'm ready to try something different and use up some of the supplies I have sitting in the freezer. I notice the pack of Voss Kviek. I notice the 2 oz of Pacifica hops. And the half pound of lactose left over from the lovely milk stout I brewed a couple months ago. And a pound of honey malt. Maybe some cyrstal malt for color?

Voss Kviek

2 oz Pacifica hops

1 lb of Honey Malt

.5 lb of lactose

The wheels are turning in my head. Assume target is a 5 or 5.5 gal batch

Can I make a decent creamsicle ale with this, on a backbone of Maris Otter pale malt? A lot of the creamsicle ale recipes I've seen are based on 6 row or 2 row, would the Maris Otter (which I understand is a 2 row derivative), so my guess is it shouldn't be too much of a stretch.

I'm assuming starting with 10-11 lbs of Maris Otter as the base

Is 1lb of honey malt too much? should I cut it to 8oz?

adding some orange peel late in the boil.

Possibly adding some vanilla, either after  few days of fermenting, or at bottling. I've got a bottle of sugar free torani vanilla syrup I grabbed on a whim from my LHBS, and I'm debating if this is worth using here, and if so, how much to try

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for thoughts on percentages. Are there other hops that I have on hand (Mt Hood, Kent Goldings, Newport, Fuggles) that would blend well with this, or should I just double-up on the Pacifica.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I plan on pitching the whole (11g) pack of voss kviek, or just half the package? I've read things about it performing very well when under-pitched at higher temps, but the package recommends .5 to 1g pitch per liter, so my guess is whole pack

Urgent Siphoning Help!!,"Urgent Siphoning Help!! Hey all,

I've done a little digging and can't seem to find an answer to this question. Hopefully this isn't redundant!

I recently started brewing my first batch of beer (Dry malt extract + cascade hops) but I've run into an issue. I fermented a 5 litre batch in a 30 litre fermenter (mistake #1) and I'm trying to siphon it now that the fermentation is complete. Unfortunately, my siphon is this annoying jiggle siphon ([Kegland siphon](https://www.kegland.com.au/plastic-jiggle-auto-siphon-racking-cane-with-vinyl-tube-10mmx14mmx1-4m.html) and I'm just not able to start the suction with it (probably because there's very little beer relative to my fermenter). In trying to get the siphoning started by doing the pump action, I've probably already aerated the shit it out of it and the sediment has definitely been disturbed. I don't have a way of getting a better siphon until mid next-week so I have a couple of options:

1. Pump even more and risk further aerating the beer to get a very slow siphon going. 

2. (My preference)  Close the lid of my fermzilla fermenter, let it sit in the closet for a few more days and then cold crash it again while I procure a better siphon. This will give a chance for the sediment to drop again. I'm just concerned about the aeration that has already happened.

Neither is ideal but since I've already opened my fermenter lid for 20-30 minutes, is it bad to close it and let it keep fermenting? Or is there pressure to bottle ASAP?

Also, given my siphon woes, I'm wary of siphoning into a bucket and then siphoning again into bottles. Are either of these a good idea?

1. Cold crash the beer again and throw in the priming sugar into the fermenter itself, mix it gently and then siphon immediately into bottles.

2. Meticulously split the priming sugar into all my bottles and siphon straight into the bottles.

First Lager tastes a bit ... earthy !,"First Lager tastes a bit ... earthy ! Brewed my first lager two weeks back. Just plain, Munich, pilsner and some wheat malt.

First time dry hopping - what to look out for?,"First time dry hopping - what to look out for? Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

tomorrow I'll be brewing a Black IPA that I am considering to dry hop. Given that I am still fairly new to homebrewing and haven't done that yet, I would like to get some advice. Say you could talk to yourself when you were first going to dry hop a beer, what would you tell yourself? What would you suggest to someone trying it for the first time? What to look out for?

&amp;#x200B;

Some details about the beer/recipe:

It will be a recreation of Clawhammer Supply's [Black IPA](https://www.clawhammersupply.com/blogs/moonshine-still-blog/how-to-brew-a-black-ipa-homebrew-beer-recipe). So that is

OG = 1.061

FG = 1.008

ABV = 6.96%

Volume = 5.3 gal

Malt:

* Pale Malt - 10lbs, 8.0 oz. (4kg 762.7g)
* Flaked Rye - 12.8 oz. (362.9g)
* Crystal 60 - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Crystal 120 - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Chocolate Wheat - 8.0 oz. (226.8g)
* Carafa III - 6.4 oz. (181.4g)

Hops:

* Columbus - 0.3 oz (8.5g) at 60 minutes
* Centennial - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at 45 minutes
* Centennial - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at 30 minutes
* Cascade - 0.5 oz (14.17g) at 15 minutes
* Cascade - 0.5 (14.17g) oz at 5 minutes

They mention that the beer is lacking hop aroma somewhat. So I was considering to add some (probably 1 oz) Galaxy hops to the hopstand. And then as mentioned before some dry hopping. I still have quite a bit of Citra hops in my storage, so I was planning to use those. I was considering to add some amount (something like 1.5 to 2 oz) after fermentation is mainly done and to leave them in for about 5 days.

Yeast:

* Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II)

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overdoing it with the 5 different hops for a black IPA? Are 1.5 to 2 ounces a reasonable amount for roughly 5 gallons in the dry hop?

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback is appreciated, thanks!",Homebrewing
"3-roller mill locks up, what to do?","3-roller mill locks up, what to do? I assembled my crankandstein 3D mill yesterday (used, refurbished), and of course i wanted to test it.

He said it tasted good but wasn't like whisky at all really.

two water questions for y'all,"two water questions for y'all Two quick water questions I hope aren't too dumb that I hope you can help me with. I haven't really spent time with water issues before but am trying to learn more about it as a way to be more detailed with my beer.

1. Does a carbon filter remove brewing minerals like Ca, Mg, Na, SO4, Cl, and bicarbonate, or not? I usually run my water through a filter and am not sure what if anything I'm actually removing doing so.
2. In BeerSmith I took the water profile I got from the tap from my city (Los Angeles, specifically East Los Angeles) and entered it in, but something seems off. Given the mineral profile (expressed by the city as mg/L but that's basically ppm, yes?) the BeerSmith water analysis shows effective hardness as only 28 ppm. However, the city's chart has a hardness (called total hardness) that is substantially higher at around 115 mg/L. Is there a difference between ""total"" hardness and ""effective"" hardness that would account for the discrepancy? One difference is that BeerSmith shows Bicarbonate as HC03 while the city shows Bicarbonate and hardness as CaC03, so something may be different there? 

At some point I may start just buying RO water and building up from it, but would like to at least understand my tap water right now. For anyone really interested digging in, here is the water report: [https://www.ladwp.com/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET\_FILE&amp;dDocName=OPLADWPCCB724703&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased](https://www.ladwp.com/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=OPLADWPCCB724703&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased).

Using an all-in-one all grain brew kettle to prepare powdered malt + grain bag recipe,"Using an all-in-one all grain brew kettle to prepare powdered malt + grain bag recipe A few years ago I used to brew a lot of Mr Beer 2 gallon batches using the canned malt syrup.  My wife encouraged me to get back into brewing again, and this time I wanted to make larger batches so a couple months ago I bought a Brew Demon catalyst kit with the 6.5 gallon fermenter.  It came with the Oktoberfest recipe.

I needed to buy a new pot to boil the malt in.  While looking for large stockpots, I found out that electric brew kettles exist.  Then I found out about all-in-one's that come with things like a grain basket and immersion chiller.

Since it was Black Friday, I figured why not take the opportunity to get a really nice one.  I got the Anvil 10.5 gallon and it came with the recirc pump free as part of the sale.

So now I have a 10.5 gallon, 220V kettle, with grain basket, immersion chiller, and a recirc pump.  To brew a recipe that comes with 6lbs of what looks like malt milkshake powder and 2 lbs of ""aromatic"" (sic) grain in sock.

Don't get me wrong this is a nice problem to have, but - my boiling setup is a bit overkill for the recipe ingredients I have.  It's unclear which brew kettle features I should *take out* for this run.  Do I leave off the recirculation pump (in case clumps of malt powder might clog it)?  Do I put the crushed grains directly in the grain basket, take out the grain basket to just use the sock, or maybe place the sock in the grain basket?

The instruction manual warns brew-in-a-bag grains might be too fine for the basket, but I'm unclear if this is equivalent to brew in a bag and I'm unclear what constitutes a fine grind.  The grains in the recipe kit seem to be all different sizes from cornmeal size to whole grains.  (Average is about cous cous size.)

Also the perforated disk which you're supposed to put over the grain basket when using the recirculation pump is on back-order, so I haven't gotten that yet; I do have the external pump itself.",Homebrewing

Can We Please Address This: Mash PH Temp Corrections and All Sorts of Confusion,"Can We Please Address This: Mash PH Temp Corrections and All Sorts of Confusion I am a lot of emotions right now.

Is mash PH the most mythical concept in homebrewing that we're all afraid to address? I've been doing a lot of research and get some conflicting answers everywhere I look. I have an Apera Instruments digital PH meter with ATC (automatic temperature control). 

From what I understand, **mash PH is lower at true mash temps (152F) than our collected sample cooled to room temp (65F).** Meaning to truly understand our hot mash PH, we need to correct for temp REGARDLESS if our PH meter has ATC functionality built-in. John Palmer suggests we should subtract 0.35 from our room temp PH reading to get our TRUE mash PH.

So if my room temp mash PH (taken at 65F) is 5.7, we must subtract 0.35 to get our actual mash PH of 5.35. **This is the number we actually want.**

**My process now is:**

1. I take my first mash PH reading after a 10-minute rest after mashing in.
2. I draw off a sample and let it cool to 60-70 degrees F.
3. I take a PH reading and let's say it 5.7.
4. I subtract 0.35 and determine mash PH is actually 5.35.
5. I celebrate and or make any acid adjustments from here if needed.

I'm assuming that ATC only helps us compensate for our room temp reading and it's not actually correcting for a true hot mash reading. If I were to take a direct PH reading in my hot mash with my digital meter I would 1. probably destroy the meter, and 2. get a truly accurate reading. Hooray.

Does this jive with what everyone else agrees on? Would love to argue about this.

**PH RANGE CORRECTION**

5.35-6.05 at room temp = 5-5.7 at mash temp",Homebrewing

Ss Brew buckets with TC,"Ss Brew buckets with TC Hello,

I've been using Speidel fermenters for a long time, and I'm quite happy with them. I've modded my 12L and 30L to add a stainless steel thermowells and fitted a cap with a gas post in order to do closed transfers to kegs.

1. Stainless seems better and more resistant than plastic.
2. I expect it would hold pressure better than the Speidels, where even 1psi seems to leak depending on how the lid is sealed.

Done taking gravity readings due to Consistently Low Gravity,"Done taking gravity readings due to Consistently Low Gravity Since my recent homebrew resurgence this year I’ve brewed around 12-15 times. Pretty much every time for the past few beers the gravity readings (SG and FG) are all about .015-.020 low. I mill my own grain but have tried both a fine milling and course. I have also tried using 100% LHBS milled grain.

I am mashing in 2 11gal coolers from Northern Brewer. I mash in by slowly adding grain and water equally. My mash temps are 150-155 for 60 minutes, vorlauf 2-3 times about a gallon each, then fly sparge with 170deg water over about 10-15 minutes.

The finished beer always ferments down to target or better FG. The beer always tastes great and after a couple pours you can certainly feel a buzz.

I cool the wort before taking readings. I also have 2 hydrometers and they read the same.

Long story short I am done taking gravity readings, all it’s doing is pissing me off and leaving me scratching my head for what I’m doing wrong. I’m always open to suggestions but at this point, have to say fuck it.

My dad and I decided to make some hard cider with a kit he received long ago. This kit was basically pour, combine, and wait. I was the minimum essentials to start. Just as a heads up the yeast is super old and after the fact of looking this up, I should've rehydrated it which could be my problem. I cleaned everything, poured cider and sugar in (I only had white cane sugar) pitched the yeast in (dry). For the first few days the yeast was moving around (I am pretty sure its bottom fermenting) and there were bubbles. Although after a few days of pitching there was no more bubbling. Its been 2 weeks now and it may be done but I am not sure. What was my problem and is it ready?",Homebrewing

What causes DMS really,"What causes DMS really A recent brew of mine had a strong off flavour that took me a bit to pin down.  It was my first DMS tinged beer.

The brew process wasn’t unusual: a 10L Irish red biab on a convection stove. 1 hour mash at 68C, 3:1 water to grain. Half arsed batch sparse because I actually had a touch too much grain and didn’t want to overshoot gravity. Hot liquor added up to the 10L and boiled for 1 hour. I chilled by putting the pot in a cold water filled sink, and running cold water in a silicone hose heat exchanger submerged in the wort, going from between 90 and 100 C to less that 30C in about half an hour.

Now, everyone will readily say the 2 causes of DMS flavour is the grain bill, chilling too slow and allowing more DMS to form after off-gassing it in the boil.

This is my first DMS experience, and my best chill. I usually chill slower by just sitting the pot in the sink alone, and at least twice have just dumped boiling wort into the ferment keg and sealed it, hosing the outside just until it’s safe to transport and just pitching the next day. I’ve also heard of plenty of people never having issue with no-chill.

So what gives? Reading up on DMS seems pretty scientifically backed, but there is plenty of empirical evidence against the supposed causes.

Does anyone have advice or general insight on this one?",Homebrewing

"Mad Scientist or Lazy Brewer, Same Outcome","Mad Scientist or Lazy Brewer, Same Outcome TL/DR: I fermented an IPA from 1.070 SG to 1.007 SG in four days and am drinking on day six. 

Last Wednesday I brewed an IPA and today (Tuesday), I’m drinking it. I have been playing around with recipes for a strawberry milkshake IPA for a few months now. After mashing my grain (missed the target gravity, but I’m still learning a new system) I realized that I didn’t have the strawberries and decided to improvise. Long story short, I threw some mango purée in my fermenter before transferring the wort over (I know you’re “supposed” to add the fruit at the tail end of fermentation) and transferred the wort at about 100F. Again playing the lazy brewer, I used the yeast I had on hand which was S-05 and pitched it hot, while the wort was transferring. I stored my fermenter in a bathtub that I know remains about 68F all day and heard nothing from the airlock after two days. On the third, I pitched another packet of S-05 thinking I had killed the first bunch. That was a waste because I took the gravity reading the next day after still hearing no activity from the airlock and I was below my predicted FG. Guess that lid doesn’t seal fully. Cold crashed yesterday, kegged last night and poured the first pint tonight. This is why I enjoy brewing, the experimentation and pushing the limits. 

Recipe for those interested (5G batch):

9 lb golden promise
2 lb oat malt
2 lb wheat malt
1 lb honey malt
0.5 lb cara dextrin (leftover so I just tossed it in)
1 oz Columbus (60 minutes)
1 oz Centennial (20 min whirlpool at 150F)
2 oz Hull Melon (20 minute whirlpool at 150F)
1 oz Hull Melon (24 hour dry hop)
32 oz Mango purée 
1 pkg SafAle S-05

Lessons learned:
- I can go from brew day to brew in hand in six days
- Not everything that is held as true in the brew community is actual Truth, it’s just the way it has been done thus far
- Yeast is hearty and will tend to surprise you
- Don’t always trust the airlock, measure gravity when in doubt",Homebrewing

I went on the more conservative side and used Vienna to hopefully keep that malt and biscuit character without the mash sucking in performance. 

Grain Bill: 

* 6.5 lbs Vienna Malt
* 3.25 lbs Munich 20L Malt
* 3.75 lbs Boneland Munich Malt
* 2 Oz Carafa (for color)
*1.6 oz Hallertau (4.5%) for one hour
*Wyeast 2026

Target OG of 1.066 (based on past experience with bigger bill beers) and FG around 1.015. ABV of 7.0. The SRM in brewtarget is 17.1 with 23-24 IBUs

Mash: 

* Protein rest at 122F for 30 minutes 
* Mash at 155F for 60 minutes

Next step guidance,"Next step guidance Hello all,

I have made 4 of the five gallon Northern Brewer batches.  Three were straight forward, the fourth needed a secondary fermenter.  I have two more batches to make, because I need practice drinking!  After the first batch I decided my stove didn't have enough ass to heat efficiently, and an ice bath in my sink was equally inefficient.  I've upgraded to a stand alone propane burner, and I have an immersion chiller that I couple with the ice bath.

I'm now soliciting you all for ideas to perfect my craft, my end results, or recommendations on the next step to delve deeper into home brewing.

I'm considering getting an air stone and medical grade O2 instead of sloshing around the fermenting bucket.  I'm also considering getting a glass beaker, shake plate to prepare yeast in advance.  So if I go this route specifically, will these measures improve clarity?  In my novice mind, they would only speed up the fermentation process.  I'd greatly appreciate that, but if the recipe calls for two weeks in the fermenter bucket, how will I know when I can bottle?  Am I risking ruining the batch if I bottle earlier than the instructed two weeks?  Am I risking ruining the batch if I speed up fermentation, then leave it for two weeks?

Next, the Kolsch I prepared called for two additional weeks in a secondary fermenter.  When I moved the five gallon batch from the plastic primary fermenter to the glass carboy there was a good amount of air (maybe five inches) at the top.  How bad is this for oxidizing, creating off flavors?  Any suggestions to overcome this issue?

Any specific or general advice or words of wisdom is greatly appreciated.

In case you need to know I don't have any crazy equipment on hand:
1 Edelmetall propane burner
2 plastic five gallon fermenter buckets
2 plastic five gallon bottling buckets
2 glass five gallon carboys

manual capper
racking canes

Heads up to Brewfather users using no sparge equipment profiles,"Heads up to Brewfather users using no sparge equipment profiles A couple days ago I opened a recipe I was working on the previous day, and I noticed the calculated mash water volume had dropped by ~1/3 of a gallon.  At first I thought I was just misremembering, but I had also filled it out in a Bru'n Water spreadsheet.  I went back through old recipes and checked against my logs, and most had changed.

Some digging around in the [changelog](https://docs.brewfather.app/changelog#2-5-0-09-12-2020) and under Fixed I found:

&gt; Now using cold boil volume rater than hot (including expansion) when calculating water for ""No Sparge"" water calculation method, this will reduce the total water calculated by 4%, you might want to increase the grain absorption rate to compensate

I did the math by hand and confirmed that it was indeed doing that.  Further digging around, I found [this post](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/brewfather-water-needed-for-batch.686474/#post-9017770) with more info, and with a response by Brewfather's creator.

So, if your current no sparge equipment profile has been tuned so your pre-boil volume is correct, be advised that you may need to adjust it.

As a side note, I was a bit confused because the incorrect calculations had seemed to be working for me.  I had imported all my recipes from Beersmith, and the water volumes all lined up, so I never really looked further.  But, looking again, I notice that the default grain absorption in Brewfather (.383 qt./lb.) is different than the default in Beersmith (.96 fl.oz./oz., or .48 qt./lb.), and the latter is closer to what I observe.  It just so happens that the different grain absorption plus the off-by-4% error almost exactly canceled each other out.",Homebrewing

Life with Kveik,"Life with Kveik Hi everyone. A year now I have been brewing with kveik and it's hard to look back. In this post I just wanted to share with you my cold side schedule for a typical brew with dry hopping.

- Pitch Yeast
- See first bubbles 30min after pitching (this depends on various factors but wont be higher than 2-3 hours) 
- Reach FG after 20-24 hours (higher OG takes a bit longer)
- Dry hop 48 hours after pitching
- Bottle on day 5-6
- Conditioning... (To my experience this takes 2-3 weeks and its the only thing that it is common to other yeasts)

I guess you I could bottle even sooner especially if not dry hopping but since I usually brew on weekends I bottle on the next weekend. But even with this schedule is a week shorter than my typical schedule with a standard yeast. 

Keep in mind that this schedule is typical for Voss, I have found that other Kveiks are also fast but may take few more Hours to reach FG.

Kveik definitely was a game changer for me as I am able to brew more often, experiment more, brew small batches. I used to have 2-3 different beers max in my cellar and with my latest brew I count 9 different beers.

I am not saying everyone should move to kveik, there are definitely more than few beers that cant be brewed with Kveik, but I strongly encourage every homebrewer just to give it a try.

Bootleg Biology NEEPAH Blend and Classic New England (BETA) Comparison,"Bootleg Biology NEEPAH Blend and Classic New England (BETA) Comparison With Bootleg Biology back in stock and releasing more strains today, I thought I would share some quick feedback. Last release, I ordered a pack of their NEEPAH Blend and Classic New England. I didn't intend on doing any direct comparisons, but I've used these strains on my last two brews with the same grain bill and hopping amounts/schedule, so this became an opportunity for a comparison of attenuation and appearance.

5.5 gal batches. Grists were 72% pale malt, 21% wheat malt, and 7% flaked oats. 5 oz. hops on the hot side, 5 oz. on the cold side with two additions: 1st at high krausen and a 2nd for 24 hours at 36F. Fermented at 64-66F, then bumped to 72F.

The NEEPAH Blend beer dropped from 1.064 to 1.014 (78% apparent attenuation) and the Classic New England Beer dropped from 1.064 to 1.010 (84% apparent attenuation). Both beers had a haze that was typical to other strains I've used for NE styles, but the NEEPAH Blend seems to be a bit brighter around the edges. The NEEPAH beer was brewed two weeks before the Classic New England, so this could be a factor, as it's had two weeks longer in the keezer, but the color differences were minimal. The main thing that stood out here was the difference in attenuation, especially the high attenuation of the Classic strain.

Early racking to secondary.,"Early racking to secondary. Hi,

Caramel in American IPA's,"Caramel in American IPA's Right, so I am trying to perfect my American IPA recipe. 

For my grain bill, I am currently using about 80 % pilsner malt and 20 % pale ale malt such as just a regular one or Golden Promise / Maris Otter variant. The beer is approx. 6 % ABV.

I recently purchased a copy of Brew Your Own's IPA style guide and was surprised to notice **every** American IPA recipe has a considerable amount of *caramel malt* in it. For my recipe, I do not wish for any more sweet or caramel flavors in order to get the beer as drinkable as possible - using something like the chico strain and American hops give the impression of sweet anyways. I mash at 65 degrees C (about 150 Fahrenheit) for a decent degree of fermentability and ferment on the lower end of the yeast's recommended temperature range in order to discourage ester production.

In the end, my beer turns out about as sweet as commercial examples go.

Among others, I believe the guys at Genus Brewing agree with me that caramel malts are best left in the bin when brewing an American IPA. I find the contradiction with Brew Your Own and several pro craft brewers interesting.

I am confused as of the purpose of caramel malt in the American IPA style and hence am reaching out to you; please give your opinions concerning the use of caramel malt in American IPA's; I am either looking to strengthen my views on forgetting caramel malts with the style OR someone to put me on the right track and turn my head towards putting 10  % of caramel 60 in my kettle.

Odd gravity readings...,"Odd gravity readings... During a ""large"" batch Farm house Saison of about 6 gallons, I took three hydrometer readings labeled ""Pre-boil"", ""Post-boil"", and ""OG"" (to show gravity when I pitched the yeast). What was odd about the readings was that the earlier gravity was higher than the latter. I was under the impression that the gravity would at least increase slightly Post-boil. The Pre-boil gravity showed 1.054 at 60\*F at the meniscus of the hydrometer, and 1.052 at the same temp for the Post and OG. My Pre-boil volume was at 6.5 gallons boiled down to 6 gallons. I did have to add a 1/2 gallon to compensate boiling below target volume.

So -0.002 isn't much of a difference, and I'm not complaining about it. I just wanted to know if its simply variation in my readings, or if its a matter of brew efficiency. Idk...

Slightly unpleasant but drinkable. My oktoberfest, brown ale, porter, Vienna lager, all tasted the same. My blonde ale, pale ale, tasted similar to the darker styles but masked by more hops. My neipa was okay but oxidised quickly. The only really good one I made was a Helles. From extract to all grain I've had this problem, and before and after controlling my temp.

Heres my process for a 2.5 gallon to 3 gallon batch

1. Heat up water to strike temp. Adjust water to add more calcium to my local water.  Pour in grains and stir.

2. Mash usually an hour at the temp in 

3. Batch sparge with 170 degree water. Drain roughly 4.25 gallons into kettle

4. Boil 60 min on stove on high. (Am I burning it? If I change it less than high it doesn't look like it's boiling though). Add bittering hops at beginning and later hops around 15 min or less depending on recipe of course.

5. Previously I'd chill using an ice bath, but more recently I'd use a  wort chiller (put in during boil to sanitize) with recirculating ice water in the sink. Stir occasionally to speed up chilling.

6.transfer to 3 gallon carboy. Aerate by splashing and shaking. (I got an aquarium pump but only used it once).

7. Since its &lt; 3 gal I think I can get away with 1 packet dry yeast, maybe 1 liquid yeast. I usually check a pitch rate calc to be sure and use 2 liquid if it says so. I've used American Ale, American Ale II, us-05, an English strain but not sure which, Scottish Ale, 34/70

8. Ferment 2-3 weeks in mid 60s with probe in thermowell. Lower if it's a lager.

Question about nutrients,"Question about nutrients I will use Fermaid O as organic nitrogen supply for the yeasts, and I will add it during the fermentation. The internet propose me two method for adding it : 

The first is to divide the total dosage in four parts and to add them after 24, 48 and 72 hours after pitching the yeasts. The last part must be added at 1/3 sugar depletion.

The second is to divide the total dosage in two. The first half must be added at the end of the lag phase, and the second must be added at 1/3 sugar depletion.

I gave 30min soak in ""rust remover"", which was mostly concentrated phosphoric acid. [It left it with a slightly darker colour](https://i.imgur.com/8ikeoxG_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)  and a decent amount of rust still on it.

I then did a progressively more aggressive scrub with a brass brush by hand, and finished with a turn on the table grinder (also with a brass brush). [And holy shit a difference it has made!](https://i.imgur.com/Zffc5Ok_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)

Calculating the pitch rate with liquid yeast,"Calculating the pitch rate with liquid yeast I'm making a strong scotch ale that is has a original gravity of 1.105 and a final gravity of roughly 1.028. To make this I thought I'd try liquid yeast for the first time so I bought \`Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale\`. 

I'm only making 5 litres (1.32 US Gallons) and I'm struggling to understand how to calculate the amount yeast I should use. 

According to [here](https://www.morebeer.com/content/yeast_pitch_calculator) I require 124 billion cells but the packet says it only has 100 billion cells. This doesn't sound right to me though as the packet says it should be able to do up to 5 gallons. I know my beer is very high gravity but it sounds like a lot to add.

My oxygen-free fermenter/bottling bucket,"My oxygen-free fermenter/bottling bucket I just want to share an alternative to fermenting in kegs. I don’t have fridge space for cronies in my apartment and still wanted some of the advantages of fermenting in kegs. I use 5 gallon buckets for 3-4 gallon batches. For my bucket lids, I’ve added a thermowell, ball lock gas post and an 1.25” hole. Overall I think most of the advantages  of corny fermenter, such as positive pressure dry hopping and close transfer, can be had with buckets. Also, I top crop whenever the yeast allows it and fermenting in bucket makes that super easy.

Fermenting: heating pads are used with probe in the thermowell. I use 3 piece airlock with #7 stopper in the accessory hole. For cooling, a stainless loop can be easily added.

Dry hopping: Can be done easily through the accessory hole. I apply positive pressure and flush with CO2 from the ball lock post if I’m dry hopping after fermentation has slowed down.

Cold crashing: I switch to a solid bung and apply light pressure to the bucket with co2 before throwing the entire bucket in kitchen fridge.

Priming: After making sure the beer has completely chilled. This should take around 24 hours. I add priming solution through accessory hole/ball lock post depending on how lazy I feel. I then agitate the bucket to distribute the solution. I’ve done experiments with my typical priming solution (1g sugar: 2g water) and found that diffusion alone cannot provide sufficient mixing even after many hours. 

Bottling: Use bottling wand on the tap with low CO2 pressure applied through the ball lock.

Temp Controlled Induction Brutus 20,"Temp Controlled Induction Brutus 20  [https://imgur.com/sBI9V2B](https://imgur.com/sBI9V2B)

I really enjoy this brew method.  The guys at Alenuts is where I first ran into it.  They have a real nice write-up (I'm assuming they dreamt up the method):

[http://alenuts.com/Alenuts/brutus20.html](http://alenuts.com/Alenuts/brutus20.html)

It's a two pot, two heat source, cross recirculation set-up.  The method was an effort to simplify from a 3 pot setup, provide clear wort into the BK, and not have the pH issues of fly sparging.  

My setup has a mashtun is on an 1800W induction cooker run by an external temperature controller.  The BK is on a 3500W induction cooker.  Two pumps required, or you can get by with one pump but you need a two tier brewstand so that the second pot can gravity feed back to the first. 

I used this brew method years ago with a RIMs tube and an induction cooker, until the RIMS tube controller died.  Then I just went full volume BIAB on the 3500W induction cooker.  I've always been a fan of induction.  No heating element touching my wart.  No risk of scorching.  Very simple cleanup.  

A while ago, I learned of Adcraft making true manual control induction cooktops that could be actuated from an external controller.  It's the one on the left in my pic.  It's 1800W 110V. They also have a  3000W 208V version.  I'm running my 1800W version with an Anvil temp controller ($25):

[https://www.anvilbrewing.com/-p/anv-temp-controller.htm](https://www.anvilbrewing.com/-p/anv-temp-controller.htm)

Super simple setup.  

I brew 4 gallon batches so I'm only using two of the $25 5-gallon stainless pots, which are induction capable (obviously).   

Pumps are the tan solar pumps.  They throttle flow rate real nice with just the valves on the pot.  

Basic brew process is:

1. Set both pots up to self-recirculate and heat MT to strike temp and BK to mash out temp (oddly enough, the onboard temp controller of the 3500W cooker will heat to around 167F when set to 150F).
2. Mash for 45 minutes while recirculating and the Adcraft maintains mash temp with +/-1F.  I mash in a bag and use a fine crush to speed conversion and you'll never have a stuck mash with a bag.
3. Start to cross recirculate at just a trickle, set temp controller to mash out temp and let it go until both pots reach temperature equilibrium at mash out temp.  This takes 15-20 minutes.
4. Shut-off BK pump and watch as pump from the MT slowly fills the BK with clear beer.  It's a beautiful sight.  The pic is of a brown porter that I just ran this morning.  

I'll get some pics up of the inside of the pots.  Thermowells and drain ports are as low in the pot as I could get them.  The MT has as domed false bottom with center pickup.  The BK has a brewhardware recirc port for whirlpool at cooling.  

What I love about it is (1) the simplicity of induction, (2) the beauty of that crystal clear wort trickling into the BK.  The fact that the mash temp is controller by two off the shelf products is icing on the cake.",Homebrewing

Unconventional RIMS?,"Unconventional RIMS? I am happy with my new setup in the basement. 3500w induction burner, 10gal Anvil kettle, BIAB. I've had 2 great brews so far, but I'm reading more and more about the power of RIMS. All setups I've seen/read about have a PID controller and heat stick to heat wort during recirculation, but what if I tried something else?

I was thinking that I could put the induction burner on the lowest setting so there's a little heat being added to the kettle below the grain bag and false bottom (false bottom to keep the bag off the kettle bottom). Then simply pump the slightly-hotter wort to the top until the temp levels out where I want and manually turn the burner and pump off. Seems like the temp would normalize at the temp I want as I monitor it, and I manually control stabilizing mash temp or getting to the next step in the step mash.

Will a Moldy Bottle Be Obvious?,"Will a Moldy Bottle Be Obvious? I was bottling some cider yesterday, and when I peeked into one of the bottles I was going to use during sanitation I saw mold growing in the bottom of the bottle. ""Gross! Well, I'm not using this one.""

Newbie Questions,"Newbie Questions Yesterday I completed my 3rd all-grain brew and my first 5 gallon batch with new equipment. I had some problems and I would appreciate some feedback for next time. Here were my steps:

1) Mash temp was 148F, which I hit, but after 20 min it went down to 146F so I added hot water. Then after 20 more min it went down to 146F again and I added hot water. I ended up adding about 3qts additional water in total. Is this correct or should I have just let it be even if it went down below 146?

2) I couldn't get temp up to 168F for Mashout. I added almost 3 gallons of near boiling water and only reached 165F. Is it bad that I didn't hit 168F? Do I really need to add 4gallons to Mashout? I ended up with 9gallons in the mash tun before sparging. This seems like alot. 

3) I recirculated for 15 minutes. The wort was better but still not completely free of stuff. SHould I have kept going? Is there diminishing returns after a certain point?

4) This was my first time fly sparging. I think it went ok. It took about 30 min to fill the brewpot to 6.25g. However, from what I have read online, when regulating the rate, I should keep the level of the water about an inch above the grainbed. I couldn't even see the grainbed, which makes me think I had too much water from trying to mashout. 

5) After I was finished sparging there was still 7 gallons still left in the mash tun. Is this normal or should most of it been drained into the brewpot?

6) My biggest issue was the boil. With 6gallons, I could only reach 208F, which held steady. It was boiling but it was not vigorous. I boiled off about 0.55g in one hour. 

7) During chilling, I had to stop at 140F and add glucoamylase. I stopped right at 140, but then it continued to cool down to about 125 almost immediately. When I added the packet, it all kind of clumped up. I stirred in the best I could. 

8) I usually just dump in a packet of dry yeast. This time I rehydrated first in some boiled and cooled water. The consistency was kind of gummy and strange.

9) The recipe shows an OG of 1.050. I hit 1.039. What does this mean? Do I still use the target FG of 1.000 or do I adjust?

10) And one other thing... I opened my beer from my second brew yesterday, and like my first batch, it is flat. No bite to it and and no head when poured into a glass. What is causing this?!

[Update] Batch Rescured,"[Update] Batch Rescured [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/k51des/rescue_a_sour_batch/)

TL;DR of OP - batch had a sour taste. Wanted advice around whether it was infection, whether to throw it out.

Thanks to advice from u/Neuroplasm that the taste could be indicative or a fermenting problem, I checked my notes and found that I fermented it way too cold. Pulled the keg out of the kegerator for a few days, used the purge valve to make sure it was actually fermenting. I assumed at first it was just the CO2 separating from the liquid as it warmed up. But after a few days, those purges had less and less of the sour smell, and eventually stopped altogether.

Popped it back in the kegerator, re-carbonated, and the batch is rescued. It is by no means one of my best beers, but it's (very) drinkable and will keep me going until the two batches I've got brewing at the moment are ready for Christmas.

So I guess the moral of the story is that the old advice of don't be afraid to dump a bad batch is still true, but also don't be too quick to give up on one that can be potentially saved.",Homebrewing

"How does my ""Will it Beer?"" inspired recipe sound?","How does my ""Will it Beer?"" inspired recipe sound? So I recently saw the ""Will it Beer?"" breakfast beer post here, and have since watched the entire series. Loved it. Really opened my mind to some of the crazy possibilities brewing has to offer. And I thought, I'm going to try my own weird ingredient addition. I was drinking Crane Brewing's Apple Spice Gose at the time and thought, why not try apple pie!

I discussed it with a friend and she recommended a stout due to some of the dairy flavors that will be present in the crust. I'm not the hugest fan out stouts, but I drink them occasionally. 5 gallons of stout would take me years to get through. So I'm going to stick with sour and hope it works out. But I was browsing recipes and two apple pies stuck out to me: a caramel apple pie and a bourbon apple pie. So I decided to make a beer joining those styles. Here's the plan:

70% pilsner / 20% white wheat / 10% caramel malt

Caramel malt should be enough to affect the color and give a caramel taste without being overpowering. But I'm going to mash apple pie in with the beer for those apple and cinnamon flavors. I'm adjusting the recipe to include a graham cracker crust so there's less dairy involved. Apple pie recipe calls for both brown and white sugar, so I aimed for a lower OG from grains to account for the probably dramatic increase I'll see from the apple pie. Hoping it's mostly fermentable so I'm not left with an overpoweringly sweet beer.

Will kettle sour with mango GoodBelly drink. No hops. I'm going to use OYL Kveik to ferment since I love kveik yeasts and I think with all the added flavors, I'm not going to get much of a yeast profile anyway.

Then after fermentation stabilizes, I'm going to add 1oz of oak cubes soaked in Jack Daniels (I know not technically bourbon, sue me).

At the end of the day, if it sucks, I'll have had fun and there's always RDWHAHB.

Question about yeast attenuation and temp control,"Question about yeast attenuation and temp control So since I moved my brewing in to the mud room I have intentionally restricted myself to brewing lagers in the winter and ales in the summer to help with temp control for the yeast.

Well this year due to covid scheduling and struggles coupled with limited Brew supply access etc I didn't get around to brewing my darker beers until November. Long story short, I have an imperial pumpkin porter using 1098 british ale yeast that I pitched at 70* but has pretty much spent the past 3 weeks 60*. Currently my attenuation is still pretty low and I'm no where near the gravity I'm expecting to hit yet. 

What are your thoughts? I have one of those heated sleeves I can put around my fermenter to slowly raise it. (Which I know I should have done to begin with..)
Would slowly raising the temp be an ok thing to do this late in the process or should I just wait it out for a few more weeks? The yeast does not appear to be stuck as my gravity seems to be going up one point every week or so but at this rate it could take a few months. I was hoping to have it ready for the Christmas holidays. 

I've only done it this way once before in the first year I started brewing. I made an ale that stayed down in my basement for 3 months while I went on a long work trip, came back, bottled it and it was great.

I brew a lot of German styles, and I [use Sauergut to adjust the pH of the mash and at the end of the boil](https://www.themodernbrewhouse.com/a-sauergut-reactor/). Here's a process I've honed over the years for making small batches of it with little fuss.

1.	Make a full batch of wort using your usual techniques. We’ll split up this batch for making small batches of Sauergut. If you’re a low-oxygen brewer, I don’t recommend using sulfites for this batch—there won’t be an oxygenation step later to use up any of the excess. Once you hit mash-out, acidify down to pH 4.0-4.3 to avoid undesirable microbes. No need to boil. Drain into pouches (1.5 L each, in my case), squeeze all the air out, and freeze.
2.	A week before brewing a beer in which you want to use ‘Gut, pull a pouch out of the freezer to thaw.
3.	One week to one day before dough-in, add Pilsner malt to the pouch (30 g, in my case) to inoculate with Lactobacillus. Squeeze all the air out of the pouch, and cap. Sous-vide at 118.5ºF until you need the ‘Gut. Acidity should be around 1.8-2.0%. I used to let these sour for just 24 hours, but I’ve found I more consistently get the desired acidity level the longer they go.
4.	Add ‘Gut as needed at dough-in and end of boil.

I use [these pouches](https://www.etsy.com/listing/646515773/pack-of-50-top-corner-screw-cap-plastic). Careful: this seller shorted me ten pouches on my order. They eventually corrected the mistake by refunding the cost of the missing ones, but it was a bit of a hassle as I had to send them photos of what I’d received, etc. Still, the pouches are of high quality and seem to handle the freezing temperatures and the heat well.",Homebrewing

Saving undercarbonated beer,"Saving undercarbonated beer I've been successfully carbonating all my brews using sugar and priming calculators (I bottle all brews) but recently got some carbonation drops in anticipation of brewing a NEIPA to reduce oxidation. 

They arrived before I bottled the ESB I had brewed so decided to practice using them and bottling straight from the primary fermenter. They were the mangrove jack drops and instructions were for one per 375ml bottle or two for 750ml (think they're Antipodean and those are the standard sizes there). I bottle in 500ml and so after a quick search read one should still be fine, especially as I was bottling a style usually served from cask.

Anyone brew with wild grains/ingredients?,"Anyone brew with wild grains/ingredients? One thing that led me to brewing was the idea of using and preserving things that my partner and I grow in our garden, or forage from the wild. Of course, I fell down the homebrewing rabbit hole and at this point 99% of my ingredients come from the LHBS. But I am definitely interested in using homegrown and foraged ingredients more, at least once the long cold Alaskan winter is over up here. In fact, I have this fantasy about eventually being able to make FREE beer, so I'm always looking for new things I can harvest instead of buying. 

**Does anyone have any favorite ingredients, that you grow yourself or like to forage? How do you go about including them in your home brew recipes?**

I've had really good luck with pureeing our wild and cultivated berries. My first couple of batches of homebrew were made for this purpose -- too many berries to freeze, can, etc. before they go bad! -- and I got started homebrewing by making easy cheesy DME batches and mixing the fruit into the primary. It made kind of a hybrid beer-wine. My partner definitely loved it! And adding puree to the primary is, I discovered, the trick to getting a fun color in your beer. The crowberry wheat I made this fall was dark purple! I know a lot of people really struggle to impart a fruit color in their beer, but that seems to be the ticket. 

At one point I had this fantasy of using wild grains. Wild rye and foxtail barley are prolific here and I started foraging them, but man, it seems like a ton of work to get a usable quantity -- especially since the wild varieties don't seem to have the big, plump grains that the domesticated species do. 

I've also been experimenting with malting local-grown barley, but in Alaska few (if any) farmers are growing malting two-row and it has been a painstaking (and ongoing) process to get the local six-row to germinate and modify evenly. Thus, I'm thinking of trying sow a legitimate small farm plot of grains this spring -- malting varieties of 2-row and 6-row, plus wheat, oats, triticale, and buckwheat -- along with several hops bines. 

Finally, what about herbs, adjuncts, and alternative ingredients? I know spruce tips have been a historical brewing ingredient -- my local LHBS even sells them -- so this spring I hope to find some spruce trees that haven't been killed by beetles, and use them. Last fall, I picked the nasturtium flowers and young leaves from our garden before the frost, and dehydrated them, but now I am not sure what I want to do with them. Also, our property has a ton of birch trees on it and I would really like to tap a few for birch syrup. Does anyone else like to brew with these types of ingredients?

I fermented it anyway, and it's tasted off since brew day. I've kegged it and carbed it and it still tastes off. Kind of like copper or a dull earthy rusty musty smell. It smells worse than it tastes. 

I was careful to avoid oxidation. I use a closed loop from my bucket fermenter and purge the keg before filling.

Update: Did my re-pitch wake up dead/sleepy yeast?,"Update: Did my re-pitch wake up dead/sleepy yeast?

When the White Labs yeast failed to get going it just sat on the bottom of my carboy like a layer of chocolate or mud. but after a couple days of the T-58 cranking it visually looks like there's less sitting on the bottom of my carboy.

Lionshead Lager – A Smoked Red Lager Made with Home-Smoked Malt,"Lionshead Lager – A Smoked Red Lager Made with Home-Smoked Malt [https://imgur.com/M30jF7m](https://imgur.com/M30jF7m)

Full blog post and recipe here: [https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2020/12/11/lionshead-lager-smoked-red-x/](https://brew4fun.wordpress.com/2020/12/11/lionshead-lager-smoked-red-x/)

So, the story behind this one is pretty simple:

1. I'm a homebrewer.
2. We won a Traeger.
3. Yes, I love BBQ, but what I REALLY want to do is make a smoked beer.

This is the result: a malty, moderately smoky lager made with 50% home-smoked Red X malt. It went far better than I expected, especially given I don't particularly love smoked beer. If you have or have access to a smoker, I highly recommend trying it!

**Beer recipe (4 gal):**

* 3.5# Best Malz Red X (cherrywood-smoked)
* 2.5# Best Malz Red X (unsmoked)
* 1# Best Malz Pilsen
* 15g Loral (10.5% AA) @ 60min
* 15g Loral @ 5min
* 1.5L starter of Saflager W-34/70
* Procedure: Mash at 152 for 75min, boil 60 min, chill to 50F, pitch yeast, ferment until nearly finished and then d-rest at 60F for a couple days. Crash gradually to 34F and lager for 4-6 weeks before serving.

**Smoking the malt:**

1. Wet the grain, using about a half cup of water per pound of malt.
2. Set your smoker to its lowest temp setting and get a good smoke going.
3. Spread the moistened malt on some baking sheets and put them directly on the smoker grate. (Fine-mesh chicken wire would work better here, I just didn't have any.)
4. Fill a spray bottle with more water and mist the malt every 20 minutes, turning it to ensure coverage.
5. Smoke for a total of 4 hours, or until grain tastes appropriately smoky.
6. Once grain is tasting good, transfer cookie sheets to an oven set to the lowest temp (170F) and dry to near original moisture content.
7. Set smoked grain in a paper bag to off-gas for a few days before use.

**Note:** This was also the first beer I made with a CBDS floating dip tube and a spunding valve, which let me ferment and serve in the same keg. It worked phenomenally well, and I think it was a big contributor to this being one of the best beers I've made to date.",Homebrewing

Ginger beer isn't scaling up well,"Ginger beer isn't scaling up well Hi guys, sorry this isn't a real beer question, but I figure the crowd knowledge in here can probably help solve this issue - I have brewed ginger beer a million times in a 20L pot and it is always fine, then I got a big 100L pot so I could make larger batches, and it never gets fizzy.

My recipe/method is the same, in the same proportions, fresh ginger juice + water + sugar + brewer's yeast (not proper ginger beer plant), and kept a nice warm temperature when needed, but it only ever brews fizzy when I make small amounts.

Howto: converting shanks with hardcoded barbs to Duotight compatible,"Howto: converting shanks with hardcoded barbs to Duotight compatible tl;dr cut most of the barb off, then drill with a counterbore bit for cleanup (the second step wasn't obvious at least to me)

pictures: https://imgur.com/a/E7jNtLP

I decided I want to build my new keezer entirely with quick disconnect tubing on the liquid side.  I bought two Duotight/Intertap shanks for testing, but they turned out to be rubbish, since they fit only Intertaps (not Perlicks) and the pour is ridiculously crappy for high-carb beers, as in ""enjoy your glass of foam""-crappy.  I cut the barb off of one of my old shanks with an angle grinder for testing, and spent ages cleaning the burrs with a dremel.  It poured a high-carb high-wheat saison like a dream, so I decided to convert the rest of my shanks.  After a lot of cleanup with the dremel, I still wasn't happy with the lips.  The rough cut had worked in the prototype, but I was worried it would accumulate gunk in long-term service, plus it's unlikely to improve the pour.

I was planning to manually sand/file the lip off -- talk about a labor of hate -- but after weeks of putting off it occurred to me that I could drill the hole clean.  I bolted the shank to a block of wood with two standard shank bolts to hold the shank steady, the bottom side bolt recessed into the block.  The hole in my drill press table is just big enough to hold the shank with some cushioning paper wrapped around, so I didn't need a more complex holding device.  I drilled until I couldn't feel the lip with my fingernail.

I'm quite happy with the result.  It took several weeks of procrastinating, at least an hour of dremel frustration, several hours of shopping to figure out the right bit, and finally a few minutes of doing.  I used the 12.4mm Bohrcraft cobalt countersink (1710 series); not sure if a cheaper bit would've worked -- I don't have much metalworking experience -- but I wanted to err on the side of too good at the cost of a few bucks, as I wasn't interested in doing cleanup for the cleanup's cleanup.

Hope this helps someone to convert their shanks.  It's really just a few-minute job (plus time required for taking the old ones out, cleaning the cutting oil off with TSP afterwards, re-building, etc.).  Obviously, the conversion works only for stainless steel shanks, not chrome-plated ones.  Also noteworthy, and something that I didn't think of in advance: the stunt makes the shank ""shorter"" since the Duotight fitting needs to screw on, so make sure it's a long enough shank or that you have a way to drill a recess for the Duotight fitting.",Homebrewing

Wind Malt / Jovaru Mixed Ferm,"Wind Malt / Jovaru Mixed Ferm My Reddit app was glitching all day after I posted this so I took it down and am re-posting. 

I brewed a beer yesterday that I’ll be racking into mulberries and pitching a undecided brett strain into. 

Exact recipe is in photos. 

Wind Malt, wheat, oats and rye. Wind Malt has almost no color and is lighter than wheat malt in SRM and needs some step mashed but has more enzymatic power than any other malt that I’m aware of due to it not being kilned. It’s dried via the sun/wind. 

I did a 20 min mash at 134*f, stepped up to 158*f then did a 15 min decoction to add color and melanoidin to the beer. In my opinion it worked beautifully, the wort came out looking like honey. 

I used Hallertau &amp; Godiva hops. Godiva are a “new” hop that come from the UK. Slightly spicy with a strong gooseberry flavor/nose. 

I also added .25 oz of dried chamomile flowers. 

This may seem like a kitchen sink beer but the wort came out great and the flowers melded wonderfully. I pitched with Omega’s Jovaru at 90*f. The yeast gives off strong lemon pitch and pepper notes, ferments super dry but leaves a ton of glycerol that adds mouthfeel and body. 

My hopes is that the chamomile and gooseberry hop flavor meld well with the earthy-berry flavor from the mulberries and brett. This is my first “mixed Ferm” beer so I really don’t know what to expect. 

If anyone has any suggestions on a particular brett strain let me know.

Great guidance if you want to bottle NEIPAs,"Great guidance if you want to bottle NEIPAs For anyone who hasn't seen it, this is an excellent guide on bottling NEIPAs while minimizing oxidation:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/d0c6hn/actually_you_can_bottle_neipas_at_home_or_how_i/

I just finished the last of my NEIPAs I bottled on November 8th, and it still tastes excellent, with barely any change in color. If you're interested in brewing NEIPAs but can't/don't want to keg, I strongly recommend you take a look.

A couple notes on my tweaks to the process:

* I've got a Tilt, so I bottled when it was at 1.020 gravity. This happened 56 hours after pitching the yeast, so pretty close to the recommended 48 hour wait. Dry hops were in the fermenter a total of 5 days before bottling.

* I fill the bottles to the brim, adding a bit extra to fill up the bottle after I pull out the bottling wand. No idea how big of a difference it makes, but I like the idea of minimizing in bottle oxygen.

* I think the process works better with a higher quality bottle capper. My last NEIPA before this, I followed basically the same process, and noted that a few of the bottles were noticeably oxidized after a few weeks, but others were not. I speculated this was due to to the quality of the cap's seal. For this NEIPA I used a higher quality bench capper, and every bottle was great.

* Be careful when pouring the beer! There will be a small but significant amount of trub at the bottom of the bottle, since you're not cold crashing- make sure it doesn't end up in your glass.",Homebrewing
Anvil Foundry vs Clawhammer 120v,"Anvil Foundry vs Clawhammer 120v Looking at the electric set up, I am limited to 110/120v due to no 220/240v in the house. I understand the differences in heat up time, and I've made my peace with that.

My question is between the aforementioned systems, is the cost for the Clawhammer over the Anvil Foundry worth it? 

The main thing I see is the difference in the basket, and therefore a difference in the max grain bill. The Clawhammer seems to have a larger footprint for storage. 

For those that have both, are there any cons to the systems that aren't readily pointed out? Recommendations are also welcome.",Homebrewing

Wind Malt / Mixed Fermentation On Mulberries.,"Wind Malt / Mixed Fermentation On Mulberries. Brewed my first mixed fermentation beer today. I am pitching primary with Omega’s Jovaru. After primary I’m racking onto some mulberries I picked over the summer and pitching with Brett. Any suggestions on a Brett strain is welcome. This is new territory for me. 

All malt cake from Sugar Creek Malt Co. Exact recipe is in photos. I used wind malt, wheat, oats and rye. For hops I used Hellertau &amp; Godiva (gooseberry) and some dried chamomile. 

The Jovaru yeast should shine with the hops and chamomile. It gives off a strong lemon pith and pepper note, along with a lot of glycerol making it a dry beer with lots of body. I don’t know if brett eats glycerol or not, but I’ll find out in about 6 months. 

I mashed at 134F for 20 min then stepped up to 158F. At the end of my mash I did a single decoction to get some color and melanoidin off the malt. Wind Malt is as pale as it gets, figured a little color would help. It went into the fermentor looking like honey. 

I’m really excited to see how this beer turns out after primary and then onto letting the brett have its way with it.

I plan on bottling 5gal of of the base beer (a funky saison, 1.005 FG), as well as a 50/50 (2.5gal/2.5gal) blend of that and another sour (1.010 FG). The calculator states for the 5gal of the base saison alone has: 0.43 Residual CO2, and 0.43 Predict CO2 w/o Sugar -&gt; needing **7.75 oz table sugar** to hit 3.2 vols

Any insights for S23 fermentation schedule/time?,"Any insights for S23 fermentation schedule/time? I brewed a cream ale recipe last Sunday that was one of my LHBS house recipes, and the yeast they provided was S23.  i did a double take since this was an ale, but I called back to verify and they said that it was correct.  Brew day went fine, pitched the yeast at around 75F (no starter), and brought down to my fermentation fridge set to 55 on Sunday afternoon.

I saw airlock activity had stopped this morning, so I thought I'd grab a gravity sample.  I'm fermenting in an SS Brewbucket, so I have a valve to grab samples from the bottom - no biggie.  It came out looking like [this, aka superchunky from hell](https://imgur.com/eWe0MDz).  Obviously there is still a crapload of yeast in suspension, and I was wondering if anybody had any insight as to when it's likely to drop out - I thought S23 was supposed to be bottom fermenting?

Aside from it having the consistency of a milkshake, the flavor seems about right for what I was expecting.  My larger issue is when I should consider pulling it from the fermentation fridge for a diacetyl rest since I clearly am not going to get an accurate gravity reading with all that crap still in there.  Should I just wait until day 10 and try again?  I also have an IPL in my fermzilla right now that needs to be cold crashed (which I generally use the ferm fridge for), granted I could just fine and keg it as-is, and crash it in my kegerator.

Basically I’m looking for any knowledge on S23 and what to expect timeline-wise.

My Plan:
- Cold crash when 2-3 Plato estimated left
- Hold for a day or two
- Pressure transfer to keg
- Attach spunding valve and let keg warm back up to fermentation temp to carbonate


Other thoughts:
- I think it should work as it's no different than cold crashing then adding a sugar solution
- I'm trying to minimize the number of transfers. I've also previously transferred to a keg to carbonate then transferred again to a serving keg but that's more cleaning and more CO2 wasted.

Obviously there are loads of all-grain recipes for such desert stouts, but I live in a small flat with a crap kitchen, so I can't go all-grain. Instead, I have to start from a kit base, and do all my flavour additions in secondary.

A note for anyone considering a 10G Spike Solo,"A note for anyone considering a 10G Spike Solo I recently had my first brew day on my pre-sale 10G Spike Solo.  Overall the day was very smooth.  It took me barely 25 minutes to get from 60 degree groundwater up to 158, and then maybe 15 minutes post-mash to get up to boil.  Clean-up was simple.  The thing is a beast and will probably outlive me... the kettle and basket with all tri-clamps attached is almost 40 pounds.

There is one thing that caught me off guard though that isn't listed in any of the online information, so I wanted to drop a mention here.

With the 10G version, when hanging the basket from the stainless hooks, the bottom of the basket sits between the 6 and 6.5 gallon mark (it hangs at a slight angle).  My system setup is I believe fairly typical (5 gallons into keg, half a gallon loss to fermenter, half a gallon loss to kettle trub, 1 gallon/hour boil-off, so pre-boil volume is 7G cold) so the bottom couple of inches of grain was fully submerged and wasn't able to drain.  This left behind a bunch of wort in the grain when I pulled the basket, as well as making a mess.

I reached out to Spike's customer support and confirmed that this is the expected level of the basket.  Unfortunately, this means that for the basket to be able to drain while hanging, the biggest batch size is 5 gallons _only if_ you don't count any loss for trub or fermentation, and limit to a 60 minute boil... so realistically, it's more like 4 gallons into the keg.  To be able to manage a larger batch size, the choices are basically to deal with the submerged grain, add top-up water pre-boil, or use a hoist instead of the hooks.

The basket draining method one was of the features that I was looking forward to with the Solo since I didn't want a hoist, so I'm a bit disappointed that it won't work as expected.  I've suggested to their support that they include this information in their FAQs (maybe the [Basket Dimensions](https://help.spikebrewing.com/knowledge/will-the-solo-basket-fit-non-spike-kettles)).  So, I'm writing here in case this information is useful to someone (especially if you're on the fence between the 10G and the 15G).",Homebrewing

Typical Expense,"Typical Expense I was looking through some recipes on Brewer’s Friend, and there was a very highly rated NEIPA at the top of the list. I looked through the grain bill and hop bill and decided to put all the ingredients in a cart on Northern Brewer, just to get a price reference. I put each grain in to the next pound, which is the smallest unit you can buy. I don’t have a grain mill so I chose to have them pre-milled. I chose the hops based on 8oz packs because it was cheaper than the individual 1oz packs in the quantities required. A total of almost 14 lbs of grain and 14 Oz of hops. So there would be a small amount leftover to start building an inventory, but not much.

It was $111, plus $21 for the water treatment salts they specified for the water profile (I’ve never done any water treatment so that would be my initial buy-in of those packages). Of course those would get used for a long time after, but still an expense for me to do it by the recipe.

Is that a normal amount to pay for smaller packages of ingredients like that? Does one have to have the space to store large quantities of malts to be able to brew from recipes instead of recipe kits? Is NB just expensive? I haven’t priced this through my LHBS yet, who I would prefer to patronize.

Some advice for a college student?,"Some advice for a college student? Hey everyone, 

I've been brewing at home twice now. First time was in my previous house, which had a gas stove, which worked reasonably well. Second time was in my current house, on an electric stove. Which is really, really difficult. I simply can't keep up with the rising and falling temperatures, and as the stove only has 6 different settings (excluding 'off'), I don't have a lot of room. 

Right now, it's just a lot of effort for beer that will probably turn out to be shitty.

Accidental cider fermentation,"Accidental cider fermentation Hey guys. I know you probably read this type of post all the time, but old posts still didn't answer my question. I have no experiencing brewing, only drinking ;) 

   Basically i'm wondering if it's possible to make an alcoholic cider from a bottle of cider I recently purchased, which seems to be undergoing some kind of fermentation. I think maybe the fridge door didn't close completely, causing it to be exposed to warmer temps. It is a 1-gallon jug. It had already been opened. It is from a local orchard but was sold at the local grocery. It is pasteurized, but has no preservatives. It says the sell by date is 12/10 and it is 12/8 today. 

  When i went to take it from the fridge earlier today, the plastic jug was so bloated that I couldn't grab it by the handle. When I took off the lid, it make a BIG hiss. It smells a little like apple cider vinegar. I liked a couple small holes in a balloon and placed on the top. The balloon filled with gas. Should i put it back in my fridge or expose it to warmer temps? Is it even possible to make this a hard cider or should i pitch it?

TLDR: Total noob. Bloated cider jug. Will it turn to hard cider or vinegar? What do?",Homebrewing

Why can't I put carbonation drops in the fermenter?,"Why can't I put carbonation drops in the fermenter? I'm new to homebrewing and still learning the fundamentals. I've read that the easiest way to carbonate is to add carbonation drops to the bottles and then bottling. I know you can also use priming sugar. But so far, the only method I've read about to carbonate the brew INSIDE the fermenter is to use special pressurizing equipment (which I won't be attempting anytime soon).

So why not just add the carbonation drops to the fermenter, instead of to each bottle individually? Won't it have the same effect if I use the exact same amount of drops?

Another question: If the brew is perfectly carbonated inside the fermenter, could I just skip bottling entirely and fill a glass straight from the fermenter?

My experience with Philly Sour. Any tips for improvement?,"My experience with Philly Sour. Any tips for improvement?   

I want to share my experience with Philly Sour yeast so maybe I can answer some questions with my experience and get some tips on how to improve things that did not go exactly to plan. 

My 5 gallon Recipe:

9 lb Pilsner

4 lb Wheat

1 lb Dextrose (10 min)

Irish moss (10 min)

Mashed for an hour at 152F with a mashout of 10 minutes at 170F. 

60 minute boil. No Hops.

5 lb Cherry Pie filling in secondary 

I pitched 2 packets of Philly Sour into about 5.5 gallons at about 70F. I hit an OG of 1.064. Fermentation went hard for about 2 days bringing gravity to 1.048. At that point, my temperature had dropped to about 66F (recommended temps are 68-77F). I was able to get temps back up to 73-76F for the rest of the way. After the initial fermentation, it stayed at 1.048 for about 2 days. I was worried at that point that it had stalled but did some research and read about others with the same experience. At about day 5 it kicked off hard again for about 3 days to get to 1.015. I left it in for another 2 days where it stayed at 1.015. I measured PH at that point to be 3.59. Not as low as I would have liked (I like a really sour beer). I would have liked to get around 3.2-3.3. I put in secondary with 5lbs of cherry pie filling. I left it at 73F for two days until I saw that the color blended and then I put into the fridge to cold crash for 4 days (I added gelatin after day 1). Upon kegging, the cherry pie filling had caused about a gallon of loss. Once carbonated, I tasted and it was a little sour, like I said not as sour as I would like and the cherry flavor was subtle if any. 

Note: I received my water report later on and my PH is 8.1. 

Some things I would like to improve – I would like to get my PH down to 3.2-3.3. Maybe I should try kettle souring and then pitching another yeast? I use an Anvil Foundry, is it cool to leave it in there while souring?

Plastic Fermenters?,"Plastic Fermenters? I have been brewing beer at home for over 10-years, always using the traditional 6-gal. glass carboy for fermentation. My beers are typically drinkable, rarely experiencing much oxidation. But, since I’ve been mostly brewing IPA that get dry hopped, I’ve found it difficult to extract clean beer from the fermenter, since I have to drop hop pellets directly into the carboy. My buddy has some stainless conical style fermenters, and these seem fantastic—a big open top so you can drop a mesh bag of hops in, and a funnel shaped base that allows for yeast harvest/trub separation. I’ve been looking to upgrade my fermentation situation, but I am admittedly balking at the price tag of these SS fermentation systems. This has me looking at the plastic conical systems (like the Fermzilla fermenters). Although I like the price of these, I am hesitant to the pull the trigger with these since they are plastic—plastic can scratch easily and collect beer spoiling bacteria/yeast.

First brew on the Brewzilla...think this one needs to be called Murphy's Law Red,"First brew on the Brewzilla...think this one needs to be called Murphy's Law Red TL;DR - First brew on the Brewzilla went tits-up, but stumbled into a success anyways.

I picked up a Brewzilla on Black Friday and decided to do my first brew with it today.  I'm still pretty new to brewing, I've done 4 brews up to this point but wanted to move to all-grain and due to space needs the all-in-one systems were the best option for me.  This weekend I unboxed the zilla cleaned it and got myself familiar with the control panel, program steps, and how long it took to get to temperature in preparation for brewing today.  This morning I set the timer so that it would start warming up about an hour and a half before I got home from work and hit start. My wife was working from home so made sure she knew that it would be turning on this afternoon, then out the door I went.  This became issue number one...whatever I did this morning for the timer was not what I did this weekend, as it apparently started heating up immediately. About 2 and a half hours into my work day my wife called me saying that it wouldn't stop beeping so she paused it because that was the only way she could get it to shut up.  I told her that was fine and I would call on my way home and tell her how to start it in manual mode.  This leads in to the only smooth part of the brew day, when I got home the water was 3 degrees shy if my mash in temp and I was able to get the mash started right away and that went just like every brew video I had watched for this thing.  While the mash was happening I started to prep for the boil and eventual cooling.  I don't have a hop spider so my plan was to use small muslin bags for the hop additions, but my dog ate my muslin bags.  My plan was to pump the wort through the chiller submerged in an ice bath I thought the chiller connection kit came with silicone hoses, but I was wrong and it is vinyl hose which Im not gonna pump hot liquid through. So I decided to run to the LHBS and get some silicone tubing and new muslin bags while the wort was coming up to a boil...but...I forgot the LHBS changed their hours due to Covid and they were closed when I got there.  Stopped for dinner at Whataburger for the family...not a single order was made correctly.  Now the boil is coming to an end, I decided I'll just used the chiller as an immersion chiller...and sonnofabitch...the sprayer is seized to the hose...goddamnitmitherhellbitch...the hose is seized to the hose bib.  So now I just gotta run the recirc pump and let this come down to temp the long way.  Now despite all of this, I was able to get this brew day finished and I learned a ton...and really enjoyed myself once I was able to laugh about everything seemingly going tits-up.

Brewing with raw wheat update,"Brewing with raw wheat update Hey folks,

Asked a few days ago about brewing with unmalted wheat (wheat berries in this case, not flaked or torrified).

Since I got so many different answers, I decided to try out a single 90min infusion instead of messing around. I was planning on reaching about 65% mash efficiency, but had to scale up my water and hops because with a 90min single infusion of 50/50 pilsner and unmalted wheat berries, I achieved a mash efficiency of 79%.

I milled my pilsner and my wheat berries in my mill at the smallest gap, ran it through a second time, and mixed in half a pound of rice hulls. Mashed @150 walked away for 90min while it recirculated, and then came back to ramp up to mash out temp @168 to make lautering a little easier and left it recirculate for another 15 mins. 

I prepared 10gallons of water total incase of increased absorption, despite requiring 8.7gallons. Planned to mash with 5ish and sparge with 4ish. Ended up using all of it in the sparge. 

I made this choice based on the gelatinization temperature of wheat being less than mash temperature. I use a single vessel, electric, brew in a basket system. If I realized how easy it would be to get decent conversion I probably would have done a full volume mash.",Homebrewing

Hello everyone. I’ve got the homebrew-scale version of the Oktober can seamer (SL1), and I love it. Up until now, I have been can-conditioning\* my beer. I prime just like you’d do with bottles, and fill as high as I can to minimize air/head space. With a few odd exceptions, I’ve had great results!

I recently bought a keezer (during the great freezer shortage of 2020, no less!), and now I’m falling back into my lazy kegging ways. However, I’d still like to can beers from my kegs. But, it’s been kind of challenging to find specific information for doing this from a homebrew perspective. Most of the stuff online is for someone working at the counter of a microbrewery, and hurriedly and sloppily “capping on foam” and handing the crowler back to the customer, and maybe wiping the sides a few times with a bar rag. I’m looking for something much more “shelf-stable” than that, something that can keep for months. 

I’m assuming the same rules from bottling apply:

**All methods:**

1. Make sure cans are cold, but not frozen
2. Minimize foaming any way you can (see above)
3. Sanitize the cans (I’ve been using a sulfite solution instead of Star San lately with great results, I brew lots of beers with massive whirlpool and dry hop additions so I’m pretty oxyphobic!)
4. Use the lowest PSI on the regulator you can that will still push beer (and be sure to “burp” the kegs first!)

**Lazy method:**

* Straight from a tap/picnic tap, try to minimize foam

**Intermediate lazy method:**

* Run tubing from tap/keg/etc with a traditional bottling wand jammed in it

**DIY beer gun:**

* Use a homemade contraption that’s like the Blichmann gun, but way cheaper.

**Expensive beer gun:**

* Buy the latest gear from Blichmann so you can CO2 purge

Would anything be different with cans? Maybe the CO2 purging would be less effective? Any other tips I’m missing?

Kegging: Regulator dropped set point,"Kegging: Regulator dropped set point I'm new to kegging and have a question.

I put my Co2 cylinder and reg in the fridge which was still fairly warm and set the reg to 12 psi to carb the two kegs. after 6 hours in the fridge the temp had dropped to about 6c (42.8f) and the reg showed a new set point of 8 or 9. I thought it was odd, and set it back to 12psi. the next morning the fridge was down to about 2c (36f) and the reg was once again showing a set point of 8. I left it there over night again, I wanted to take a look on line to see if I could figure it out.

Am i right in thinking that as the temp dropped the setting on the dial would also drop? 

Am I fine to go back to the 12 psi setting as my temp in the fridge is pretty much stabilized?

I read a few posts that suggested it but I had to ask.

I'm thinking that I shouldn't have bothered to set the reg to my desired setting until the temp in the fridge hit operating temp and the beer in the kegs had been chilled to the right temp.

I'm confident that I don't have a leak, well kinda confident. I checked all the connections that were either factory or the ones that I changed out, no leaks. The kegs, while used, showed up under pressure.

Am I right in my assumptions about the reg and temp? I'd like to set the reg back to 12 again, but I was afraid that I might open the fridge tomorrow and see all of the changes come back and instead of being 12 it's 20 or higher!

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

How to Make Traditional Chinese Rice Wine and Common Mistakes,"How to Make Traditional Chinese Rice Wine and Common Mistakes I came through a sake post where people were talking about fermenting rice. My family has been making traditional Chinese rice wine for a long time. I was drinking/eating my grandmother's creation since I was a wee baby before immigrating to United States in my teen years when my parents stopped supplying me rice wine because it was against the law. Since moving to the US, my mother had made many batches of rice wines and I have also made multiples in college (I do more beer brewing though). I will write out the recipe below 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Soak sticky rice for 6-10 hours, steam them through (don't cook them like regular rice)
2. After rice cools down, sprinkle crushed yeast ball into the rice and mix (get them in Chinese markets or Amazon) Each ball can do around 1 pound dry rice.
3. Pack the rice mixture into a clear container (NO ADDITIONAL WATER !) 
4. (If you are also using red yeast rice: sprinkle the grinded down red yeast rice on top) If not just ignore this step, they can also be found in Chinese markets or on Amazon
5. Use a spoon or an utensil to dig a well in the middle.
6. Cover the glass container and let it ferment (important to cover up), 
7. When there's liquid in the center well (usually 3-5 days if it's warm or up to a week in winter) you've got yourself a delish low abv rice wine, put it in the fridge to stop it from fermenting or leave it out a couple more days to get a stronger one. It can be stored in fridge for a couple weeks. 
8. If you let it sit more outside, rice would float to the top 

These following points need to be followed for an authentic Chinese rice wine experience

1. You need to use Sticky Rice (find them at any Asian supermarkets)
2. The rice need to be soaked then steamed, not cooked in water
3. You should not add any water to the rice after soaking initially, the alcohol will come out of the rice 
4. Don't stir, let it sit 
5. It should be a low abv sweet wine generally under 5% abv
6. Don't discard the rice, eat them, they taste sweet and boozy 
7. Try cooking with the fermented rice [https://thewoksoflife.com/sweet-fermented-rice-jiu-niang/](https://thewoksoflife.com/sweet-fermented-rice-jiu-niang/) that seems to be a good recipe",Homebrewing
HELP! Disaster aversions advice required.,"HELP! Disaster aversions advice required. Hi homebrew crew.

I am trying to avert a minor disaster. I have had my Christmas booze brewing for a while now and most of it is happily clearing. I have some strong Yorkshire ale, some Russian stout, some red fruit cider and some desperados style larger.

All are form kits.

The Desperados is actually the Mexican beer from bulldog with some tequila mix added for the 2nd fermentation along with some lime cordial. This is my problem beer. It has another week or two to clear and to be ready to be drunk. However today in testing I discovered there is a crack in the barrel. The result of which is that the beer is not fizzy. This, in and of itself, isn't a huge issue as it tastes great. (I will share the process for making desperados style beer from a kit if anyone is interested in the future)

As I see things I have 3 options to save this beer.

1. do nothing, drink it quickly (23 litres) adding propellant gas to the keg as we go and hope not too much O2 gets in to spoil it
2. rack it into another keg re-gas and drink from there, will still be pretty flat but tastes good so what the hey
3. rack it into another keg with brewing sugar, have another fermentation and drink it in February
4. bin it... not going to happen

My problem is the following; I don't have the space or equipment do to all-grain brewing. So I'm working with extracts. It worked quite well for my first homebrew; I replaced the base malt with a similar extract and the specialty grains were clearly pointed out in the recipe. It seems a bit more complicated with this one. Right off the bat, I'm thinking my specialty grains would be the Crystal grains...? And I'm wondering what kind of extract I should go with. I was thinking pale extract? But the ESB Malt takes up a considerable portion of the total grain bill. So I wasn't sure.

I'm also wondering if a boozy recipe such as this one would call for two packets of (rehydrated) SafAle US-05?

And finally, I've seen so many people online dismiss secondary fermentation as unnecessary but the book I've read on homebrewing swears by it. This recipe calls for dry-hopping, should I dry hop in a secondary vessel or can I just do it in my primary fermentor?

Help! Will i get heavy metal poisoning if I drink this?,"Help! Will i get heavy metal poisoning if I drink this? Bit of a long explanation but bare with me, I was making a mango and peach cider and when I checked about 2 weeks in it stinked of sulphur, I had forgotten to put yeast nutrient in. After a quick Google I saw that you could splash rack it at the risk of oxidation. A beer hack I like to do with my IPAs to prevent oxidation is to add vitamin C so I thought it would be a good idea to add it to the cider so I did before splash racking it. But still no dice it stunk of sulphur something terrible. After some more googling I put three copper coins and a tiny coil of copper wire in a hop bag and put them in the fermentor for three hours. The idea here being that the copper reacts with the sulphur and then drops out of solution and any leftover can be cleared with bentonite which is what I was planning on doing. However I know the vitamin C can react with metal particles to form superoxidisers and oxidise the cider heavily which I'm honesty not too worried about. What I am worried about is that if it is possible that the copper could be brought back into the solution because of this reaction and possibly lead to heavy metal poisoning?

Mead questions,"Mead questions Hi guys,

I am currently making some mead and it is a little bitter. I have used the 3 lbs of honey per gallon as suggested but it doesn’t seem to be as sweet as it should be. I think the reason why is that the must was too warm when I added in the yeast. It has been fermenting for about 3 weeks now and I just sampled it. Is it possible to add in more yeast to make it sweeter this late? Is there anything that can be done to adjust the sweetness or is this batch just gonna be bitter? It’s definitely still fermenting but it does not seem to have the activity as my previous batch. My guess is the yeast were largely killed off by the heat.

Quick thoughts on a spur of the moment brew day.,"Quick thoughts on a spur of the moment brew day. I’m going to brew a beer today. My brother took my propane tank and I’m not getting it back today. 
Original plan was a 5gal all grain batch made in a 15gal pot on a propane burner. 
New plan is to mash the same grains in my 5 gal pot on the stove and at the end of the day top up in the fermenter to desired OG. 

Mash at 153-155F
9LBS 2-row
1.7 oz crystal 40
1oz centennial at 60
1oz centennial at 15
1oz centennial at flameout.

Estimated OG of 1.057

These are all ingredients I’ve had sitting around for a year. Unmilled grains in bag/sealed containers, and hops in the freezer. The centennial bag was open too. I shall call this Old Dusty",Homebrewing
Wacky mixed ferm (ft. cool pellicle),"Wacky mixed ferm (ft. cool pellicle) So I started this beer December 2019. It began as a pretty standard saison with lime zest (90/10 pils and wheat, saisonstein's monster yeast,) after primary was done I pitched Bootleg Biology's Funk Weapon 3 and let that ride until July 2020. at that point I tossed in around two pounds of pineapple and a pound of mango, and tossed in a little belle saison yeast to make sure those sugars got dealt with. 

Cracked into it yesterday and [whoaaaa pellicle](https://imgur.com/a/cpw1mEa). 

[And in a glass.

It tastes fantastic. The fruity notes come through more than anything, but there's some funky brett quality going on as well. Not really much saison character or sourness to it, but no complaints from me. Gonna be kegging it in the next few weeks. Firm believer in Funk Weapon 3.

Does blowoff tube diameter matter?,"Does blowoff tube diameter matter?

Fruited Sour,"Fruited Sour So I am making my first sour. A Philly sour. I added about a pound of pureed Raspberry at the very end of the boil to aid in lactic acid production of the yeast. And plan to add another 2lbs of Raspberry in the fermenter along with some other adjuncts. I have read up on some advice and I cannot decide what is the best route for me.

I am using a Spike Flex+ fermenter and fermentation is about halfway complete. This yeast seems to be slow and steady.

At first I planned on adding the puree now(halfway to FG). Then I thought maybe fermentation might affect the fruit flavor. However, my OG ended up lower than planned  so I thought this might give it a boost.

Plan 2. Post fermentation. I don't do secondary. Think adding fruit after fermentation without racking off yeast is a problem? (Can't dump yeast with the Flex)

Plan 3. I don't have another fermenter other than a bucket. I could rack into a bucket with the fruit. I am a bit obsessed about oxygen ingress so I'm not a fan of this...however willing to do whatever is best.

Brett brux questions,"Brett brux questions I brewed a grisette using WLP565 Belgian saison yeast that finished fermentation at 1.005 SG, then racked it into secondary and pitched brett brux into it (my first time using brett).  3 months later, there’s no pellicle and another hydrometer gravity measurement showed exactly the same 1.005 SG, but tasting from the hydrometer tube definitely brought the funk flavors I’d been looking for with the brett.  

I am certainly open to the possibility of human error on the two SG measurements but haven’t experienced anything weird using this hydrometer before.  My two questions are:

1) I’d like to bottle this batch.  Should I use priming sugar and/or bottling yeast, or will that get me bottle bombs, and I should just bottle with nothing extra and assume the brett will keep chewing on sugars and generate carbonation over the long haul? 
2) The reason I’d like to bottle this batch is that I’m brewing a saison tonight and have the idea of pitching it onto the brett cake in 3 weeks.  Can you reuse a brett cake from secondary?  Given the lack of pellicle and apparent lack of attenuation of the previous beer in secondary, will this brett cake do much with the saison when I rack it on there?

Any insight would be much appreciated!  Thank you!",Homebrewing
Do not overlook water chemistry,"Do not overlook water chemistry Since I started brewing, I avoided thinking about water chemistry despite all of the evidence that it's one of the most important parts of beer. Then yesterday I tasted the water profile series from Mikkelier: four pilsners brewed with four different water profiles. Not only was the difference immediately obvious, but one of the beers was downright disgusting (Pacific profile).

What was really interesting about this test specifically is that it was a simple pale pilsner, so there was nothing else to mask how the water flavor influenced the beer. I highly recommend you get your hands on these or try to do a similar water profile taste test. It'll change how you brew forever.

Are Partial Mashes Really This Good?,"Are Partial Mashes Really This Good? Hey everyone! 6-7 years ago I started brewing. First I began with basic kits that didn't make great beers, but as time went on I learned more and more and started all grain BIAB and non-BIAB brews. I did this for about 6+ of those years. Recently, while making a few batches for Christmas season when friends come over, I decided I was pressed for time (I aimed for 5 separate beers - all bottled conditioned), so without much time, I said ""shag it"" and went with a partial mash recipe I came up with on the fly for 2 beers. Essentially, I made a split batch with the same beer, except that one I added some post-mash oats for additional body. I did one with just EKG and the other as a sort of red IPA. Both hit 5.5% ABV.

I had a few ideas for what to do to make sure the beer was going to be decent. I added yeast nutrient, which I never do, and I made sure to do a good step mash on the few grains I did mash. I also made sure to have great yeast starters for both. The result? Two blow offs (one of which actually knocked off the airlock)! What an active ferment.

Anyhow, I tried both today while bottling and I can already tell that these two beers are by far the two best beers I've ever made. I'm blown away. I felt like I was somewhat cheating the process, but man oh man if this is the result.....I don't know if I can go back to full all grain. Less clean up, less fuss with grains, easily hitting gravities....and the clean crisp taste and unbelievably remarkable clarity. Damn.

Anyone else have similar experiences? Cheers!",Homebrewing
India Pale Lager - Recipe and notes,"India Pale Lager - Recipe and notes Wanted to dive into lagers a bit more, but still love a great hoppy beer, so the combination was appealing. 

I had a few goals with this brew:
- A balanced, but crushable beer with a noticable hop presence
- The final product still reads like a lager
- Test out the effectiveness of a hot (185F) whirlpool for bitterness and aroma
- See if Idaho-7 is the miracle hop people say it is

Here's the recipe:

OG - 1.050
FG - 1.009
IBU - 45
ABV - 5.2%

7# Rahr Domestic Pilsner
2# Weyermann Vienna
0.5# Crystal-20
0.5# Belgian Biscuit

0.5 oz Cascade @60
0.5 oz Cascade @10
1 oz Idaho-7 @10

1 oz each Idaho-7 and Mosaic 185F Whirlpool for 15 min

1 oz each Idaho-7 and Mosaic dry hop

Fermented with S-33 @55F, raised to 60F after seven days. Cold crashed at terminal, kegged, then cold conditioned 3 weeks.

http://imgur.com/gallery/PxR1S4O

The final product is, in a word, fantastic. It is crisp and light like a lager, with a wonderful aroma and smooth bitterness that follows through to the finish. The aroma isn't overwhelming but has sweet berry and cherry notes. The taste is a touch sweet with biscuity malt notes, and a brightness from the Cascade that I think pairs really well with a lager body.

I'd love to see more brewers take a crack at the style. Subtlety and balance can be difficult but very rewarding.

I could also do another 7 gallons of lambic style wort soon, get another carboy (or sacrifice a bucket) and put the BB packs into it, and the samples into a couple 1 gal jugs, split by lambic / gueuze or various mixed cultures.

Sooo I took it home. I ended up with like 50lbs of pineapple so i gave a ton of it away.

Anyways I ended up with a ridiculous amount of pineapple juice enough to fill bottles up with. one bottle was a pop cap bottle and this bottle got forgotten in the fridge for awhile. about a couple weeks in we cracked it craving pineapple juice and discovered it fermented a little bit kuz it was a little bit fizzy but tasted wonderful!

I threw in a cinnamon stick and a couple cloves and let it sit for like another month or so... (we just forgot about it for awhile)

The time comes where we remember about our little bb in the fridge and we pop that bad boy open. the cap pops with the pressure of a shaken champagne bottle and lets out a 1/6 of the bottle in foam or whatever but the way those flavors developed in that bottle was AMAZING!! The pineapple cinnamon clove combo and the way the pineapple flavor had developed. It had a nice crisp fizz to it too that was just Soooo Right!  


So here I am now years later dreaming of those flavors. I'd like to understand what happened on accident with my bottle so I could do it on purpose again with consistency?

BIAB - bitter aftertaste help?,"BIAB - bitter aftertaste help? Hi all. I'm having a problem with my last two BIAB batches. For some reason I'm ending up with a very weird, unpleasant bitter aftertaste. I recently made a strong bitter that had this problem but I figured it was because I overran the mash temps a bit and it's still pretty good.

I was making a saison yesterday and everything was going well. I hit my temps perfectly (although I didn't hit my gravity numbers...grumble) and had a good boil and whatnot. It seemed like things were on track. But then I took a sample of the wort and was displeased to find that same weird bitter aftertaste!

High ABV beer hasn't carbonated,"High ABV beer hasn't carbonated I've made a winter ale that is roughly 10.5% and uses Safale S-04 yeast. The final gravity was 1.018 as expected.
S-04 handles temperatures 12c and higher and has an alcohol tolerance of 9-11%. 

After two weeks I've noticed it's flat. I'm trying to decide if I leave it as it might take longer or if there are other solutions such as adding another higher tolerance yeast. 

My thoughts are that it could be 1 of 3 things. Too higher alcohol killed the yeast, it's a darker beer so taking longer to carbonate, the yeast settled more than normal so it's taking longer to carbonate as less yeast is suspended. 

What is most likely the cause and are there any remedies? 

If it's best to leave it then it's okay as it's turned out quite like a wine. S-04 seems to impart quite a tart flavour.",Homebrewing

For those that are curious...this was an extract kit that I dressed up for Christmas. 7.5% ABV. It was slated as an amber ale, though it came out much darker. It came with mulling spices, and I added some extra cinnamon, and of course the rum barrel aging. Not easy to find rum oak. I used barrel chunks being sold for meat smoking (Amazon), charred those a little extra with a butane torch, and soaked them in cask strength rum to both sanitize and infuse more rum flavor. Dumped both the rum and wood in secondary for about 4 weeks. It's been in the bottles since June.

I don't have a great palate, but I'd say where it's lacking is in needing a stronger malt character to back up the spices. Maybe it's over spiced, and it fermented too warm, so it's a little boozy/harsh. I didn't add much rum, maybe 1/2 cup in 5 gal, but that could be part of it. Too long on the oak? Too short?

%100 Rauchmalz update,"%100 Rauchmalz update I posted a couple weeks back about brewing a %100 rauchmalz beer. The beer has been in keg for three days. Just thought I’d give a follow up since the keg is going into hibernation mode for a month or so to condition. 

[Såinnhus Rauchbeir ](https://imgur.com/gallery/AmDgXVl)

I used %100 rauchmalz that was fire kilned over beechwood fires. It’s not nearly as smoky as you’d imagine. I used hard well water from the farm animal hose for this beer and it’s spot on to style. Has a traditional Pilsner/Helles feel to it. It’s not brilliantly clear yet but a month or so in keg should help that. The noble hop character plays so well with the water profile and the slight malty back bone compliments the smokiness, ending very crisp. 

I didn’t have high expectations going into this beer die to the malt bill but even this young I think this might be one of my favorite home brewed beers to date. 

If I brew this again I’ll most likely add a touch a Munich malt and I’d probably use whole leaf hops.

"Moldy keg top, pinhole leak, mold - can I boil the gaskets?","Moldy keg top, pinhole leak, mold - can I boil the gaskets? Hi all, super quick question.

Can I boil the black rubber o-rings from the keg lid rim?

I have one empty keg that seals, but the rim was covered in mold and the lid needs a new pressure relief valve.

I have another keg, this one full of a new brew, with a slow leak at the lid rim, and I'm losing all my gas.

If I can boil the lid ring from the empty, moldy keg and put it on the leaky, full keg, I'll be all set.

Is my CO2 regulator dead?,"Is my CO2 regulator dead? Hey there. I have a 2 kg CO2 bottle and a regulator which I use to force carbonate my beer.

I've used it for 5-6 brews without issues. Today when i wanted to apply some more pressure to the keg I found the regulator wouldn't go above 20 psi, no matter how much I turned the regulator screw. I shrugged it off and tried again later with the same result. I then tried to unscrew the regulator screw as much as it could, testing the gas pressure every now and then. Each time I turned the pressure down a notch I could never make it go above that pressure again. Now I can't turn it on whatsoever. The gauge reads 0 and only a very low fizz is heard when I depress the pin in the cornelius ball lock that is attached to the regulator. Nothing happens even if i screw the regulator screw all the way clockwise. Has anyone dealt with something like this? Can it be fixed or should I look for a new regulator?

Refractometer issue,"Refractometer issue Ok, this has got me stumped and has had me stumped for years.  I've always taken refractometer  readings ever since I got one like 10 years ago, it's a Milwaukee MR32ATC from Morebeer (I think).  Usually, I use the refractometer pre-fermentation, and hydrometer post-fermentation... but I didn't bring the latter to my temporary location.

Anywho, I keep having  issues with my numbers.  Like, they're not consistent.  I religiously  have pre-boil readings that are higher than post-boil.  I'll have  pre-boil gravities lower than after boiling and adding 2 pounds of  sugar.  Usually I Papazian it and move on, thinking it would be stratification of the wort or something.

While  brewing today I was getting measurements pre-boil and figured I'd do a little experiment.  If I stired the boil and put drops from the spoon on the refractometer and got 15.25 brix.  If I stir the boil and put drops from a pipette on the refractometer, I  get 12 brix. I repeated this like 5 times with the same results.  The pipette didn't have any water on/in it (might have had residue from the previous sample) and these measurements were taken within seconds of each-other with a rinsed off and towel dried refractometer plate.

After chilling today's wort, the refractometer read 13 brix.

The only think I can think of is the metal spoon evaporating wort in the second it's between wort and refractometer, but that seems bonkers, or keeping the sample exceptionally hot... although, waiting around for a minute didn't change any of the readings.

I have no idea what's going on with this thing, which can put some brews between 7% and 12% abv, and no clear efficiency data.

Any ideas?",Homebrewing
Fermentation temperature,"Fermentation temperature I made a roggenbier (48% rye, 23% pilsner, 20% Munich 10L, 8% Caramunich II, 1% Carafa Special II) and fermented with WB-06 at 60-61 F.

Now, after 21 days at 60-61F and a diacetyl rest of 3 days at 64F, it tastes acid, not quite like green apples, but not quite vinegar neither (so, is it acetaldehyde or acetobacter, I don't know). FG at 1,009 (target was 1,013).

Beersmith states that this yeast should ferment between 59-75 F, but on Fermentis site, it says that, ideally, it should sit between 64-75F (I just notice this). Could it be that this low fermentation temperature (60-61F) created this off flavor? I was thinking letting the beer at 70F (outside the fermentation chamber where a delicious kölsch is coldcrashing) for a week or two. Thoughts?

First world beer problems - It doesn't get cold enough to make an ice beer,"First world beer problems - It doesn't get cold enough to make an ice beer I brewed up a 7% ABV brown ale a couple months ago and was planning on making an 'eis-brown'.  The plan was simple:

1. brew a higher abv beer
2. let it ferment to completion
3. rack to a clean keg
4. put the keg outside when it got cold enough to freeze some of the water in the beer
5. rack the unfrozen beer to a serving keg
6. carbonate and enjoy

I got to step 3 just fine and had been watching the weather for the last month, waiting for it to get cold enough at night where i thought it would adequately freeze the beer.

Well, last night the forecasted low was 9'F so I put the keg outside around 2 in the afternoon when it was 34'F.  I let it sit outside from 2pm -&gt; 6am.  It was 10'F when I woke up and thought things went well.  

I shook the keg a little bit and heard icy slush in there.  I proceeded with step 5 from above, hoping it froze enough.  When the transfer was complete, I opened the original keg and saw there was maybe an inch of slush at the bottom.  Definitely not enough to really see any kind of significant abv boost.

The forecast for the foreseeable future has lows only around 30, so I guess I'm going to have to be happy with what I got.

In the future, getting the beer closer to 0'F is probably necessary.  Unfortunately I don't have a freezer large enough to put a keg in there either.",Homebrewing

Well I added wine yeast instead of beer yeast and it.... turned out good!,"Well I added wine yeast instead of beer yeast and it.... turned out good! Long story short, accidentally added the wine yeast EC-1118, instead of a beer yeast, BE-256, to a belgian ale that I was brewing.   


Realized the next day, and decided to let it brew out and see what happens. OG was 1.040 and FG was 1.025. Underattenuated but tasted really good, not sweet. Would've made a good beer by itself. Approx 2% ABV.   


I decided to increase the ABV so added table sugar(with 40% water and boiled before cooling down) and added it to the beer, along with the BE-256 mixed into the sugar solution bringing it back up to 1.033 Gravity.. I know that wine yeasts are supposed to be yeast killers, so worst case only the table sugar ferments to the wine yeast, or best case the table sugar and the remaining maltotriose ferments from the BE-256.

All the bottles were sanitized the same (though I used one instead of regular starsan, but followed starsan procedure. Maybe the problem was here). They all seemed well sealed. The guy who gave me the bottles has a habit of putting his cig butts in them, but they were all washed and scrubbed pretty well.  I stirred in the priming sugar well (but not vigorously).  
The batches were not cold crashed, but I siphoned the beer off the top.

[Here's the latest desktop version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e34a5JHEoH-6IEPhhK5e0uwKVXyZRqOq/view?usp=sharing). Make sure Macros are enabled if you're going to use them.

Here's why you might be interested in the newest version of the desktop file:

* It computes everything you need for making beer recipes. Also these updates:
* Figured out how to add DME, juice, and sugars correctly.
* Made the style, hop, and fermentable tables editable without crashing everything (including clearing). So now you can change what's there or add your own stuff. Adding hops works but you might want to go into the macro if you want to add a hop *and* have the macro reset it.
* Added AHA styles
* Added every hop BSG sells as of 1-1-19. 
* split decoction into adding back in vs separate boils.
* Fixed so many bugs, and more

To use the sheets version, go to File-&gt;Make a Copy. 

Now there's a downside of the Google Sheets version, I could never get the beerxml compatibility to work. However:

* You now no longer need excel! Any web browser with HTML5 that can run Google Sheets should be able to run this.
* All the macros are in Tools-&gt;Macros. Skipping between English and Metric? You got it. Clearing and resetting? Sure. They do take longer due to being on the cloud, but it means I can type up a recipe at work and pull it up on my phone later.
* The inputs autofill! No more scrolling on those tiny dropdowns.
* There are the macros GUI\_print and Metric\_GUI\_print. Pressing those will (hopefully) create a pdf of your recipe and it will add it as a new document in your drive. There might be some issues about hidden sheets but idk I just going back to the associated GUI page and trying again and it works.

The downside of cheapening out,"The downside of cheapening out A couple of years ago, I purchased a used 14 gallon Bachmann fermentor with the leg extensions.  My environmental chamber is in a different room than my brewlab which means I have to fill it in one room, then get it into my environmental chamber in another.

Looked at the cost of Blichmann casters and there was no way I was going to pay 100 bucks for some steel and casters.  So I went to harbor freight, bought a cheap flat dolly, disassembled it and cut it up then secured the fermentor ( sans extensions) to the dolly.  It worked enough to work but it was pretty much amateur hour ( the dump valve was immediately above the top of the dolly, getting tubing onto the barb was a pain)

For black Friday Blichmann had a 50  percent off accessories sale and I jumped.  Putting on the casters took me 40 min ( 10 min looking for a screw I dropped) and man oh man is this better.
 
I should have done this from the start, but I wanted to cheap it out with ""good enough""
I am sure lots of people have far nicer rigs than mine and there are times when being cheap is warranted.  Seeing as I got a really good deal on it used I should have splurged for the wheels and now I am glad that I did",Homebrewing

Wheat usage in a NEIPA,"Wheat usage in a NEIPA I tried brewing an NEIPA about a month back using a WeldWerks clone (from the AHA website). The grainbill utilizes 12oz of each Flaked Oats, Flaked Wheat, and Wheat Malt for a 5 gallon batch.  I ended up using S04.  

After about two weeks in the keg it dropped pretty clear.  I'm going to try to re-make it in a few weeks to fix some problems. Any help would be appreciated.  


What do I need to increase to get that really hazy NEIPA appearance? 

I assume using White Wheat Malt for the ""Wheat Malt"" is acceptable?

Best software for tracking several iSpindels?,"Best software for tracking several iSpindels? I've had my Tilt for a couple years and have loved it. But I brew for a house of 6 beer drinkers now, so the one just isn't cutting it anymore. I've decided it's more cost effective to build a few iSpindels to start tracking batches. And the rechargability/18650 battery feature really sold me. I'll think I'll just be switching to using the Tilt on brew day to replace my refractometer/hydrometer readings, I'm not sure I trust the PET plastic in the iSpindels to take readings from hot wort.

Anyway, I still haven't settled on what I'm going to use to track them. My current setup for my Tilt is an old phone constantly logging to a Google Sheet via the Tilt app. This is what I would most like to replicate, although using an old laptop/raspberry pi isn't out of the question.

My goals are:

1. Ideally log to the cloud/Google Sheet. I know how to set up a service accessible outside my home network, but that's less than ideal.

2. Have the data easily accessible/readable later. I keep pretty detailed logs, every brew has a log folder in my Google Drive with the Br'un Water profile, Tilt spreadsheet, and detailed notes I keep via a printed and then scanned checklist. So if something goes wrong I can look back and see what changed. I really like the Google Sheet logging because it can be stored all in one place with the other stuff, and isn't locked into another service like Brewfather or something.

3. Read and log up to 3 devices at a time.",Homebrewing
Issues with WLP-002,"Issues with WLP-002 For years, I used 1968 for all of my stouts. Loved how it made for malty beer while floccing out like a champ, as I had no cold crash capabilities. Had read about folks who had issues with this strain floccing so well, that it’d drop out prematurely and leave under-attenuated beers, but I never had that issue. I’d rouse the yeast after 48 hours and all was good. 

Wasn’t able to get 1968 from my LHBS, so I used WLP-002 instead, as I was to understand they are fairly interchangeable. Made a brown ale about 8 weeks back, which started at about 1.050 and stalled out around 1.020. Realized it at packaging, so I just legged and drank shite Newcastle’ish for a few weeks. 

I brewed a stout and just dumped it right onto the yeast cake leftover from the brown ale, and everything fermented out perfectly. Hit all my numbers. Packaged that stout and put another right on top of that yeast cake, and again, everything went perfectly. 

Brewed another brown ale last week, and used a new pack of WLP-002 with a starter. OG at 1.055 and stalled at 1.023. Dumped a dry pack of US-05 in there to see if it’d chew down the rest of those sugars, so fingers crossed.

What are the best alternatives to 1968 / WLP-002? I want something that accentuates the maltiness of my dark beers, but won’t stall out. Also, floculation isn’t nearly as big of a deal, as I have cold crash capabilities now.",Homebrewing

As everyone saw this past weekend SSBT did a big sale on Chronicals and Electric systems. I have had some customers on the fence about buying SSBT equipment because of the high price tag. When I saw the sale I logged on to the wholesale portal I saw the sale was also applicable to retail outlets. 

I contacted the customers and let them know, about the sale and if they were interested to let me know. A few customers were definitely interested and wanted to get it through me to support a small business. When I tried to place the order the ordering page was locked out.

I contacted retail support, no answer. I contacted them via social media, no answer. I submit a trouble ticket and 1 day later they respond saying &gt;Sales are only available directly through our webstore and are not available direct to retailers at this time. Additionally, we are not accepting any wholesale orders during the event.

Now as a retail outlet, I look at myself as an extension for SSBT, we have limited for space and prioritizing my vendors is fairly important. Sadly at the time of me righting this I have not heard back from SSBT wholesale team, I am also unable to submit orders. 

I am bothered by the lack of response and customer service. It seems SSBT is completely fine with this behavior. I just hope if I have a problem with my equipment they are a little more responsive.

 Recipe:

 In a cauldron, take last year's barley that's grown some colourful friends, roast it over a low fire until the stink is replaced with the smell of burned syrup.

 Take equal parts new Wheat, soak it in clear ice water for two days, and add to the cauldron with enough water to fill to the top.

 Boil over a hot fire for a morning, strain into a tub and re-boil the grains one more time. 

Add to a cooled broth five apples, a bush of lavender, one medium plant of sage, and a fist sized ball of pine tar.

If I use the kettle as a mash tun, I'll still have to drain the wort into another kettle, correct? (I don't have another 10Gal kettle, so the wort would go into two or three containers. I would then need to dump out the spent grain, rinse it, and return the wort into the kettle for the boil. 

Am I missing something? Am I better off just buying a 10Gal cooler and (potentially) use the false bottom and the bazooka screen in the igloo rather than the kettle?",Homebrewing
Help me improve a dark mild,"Help me improve a dark mild Hi,

I recently made 6 liters of this dark mild beer. The goal is a beer to have on weeknights so a low abv beer wirh malty flavour is desired. Here is the recipe recalculated to 19l/5 gallons

Method: Biab
Srm: 16.4
Ibu: 20
Abv: 3,3%
Og: 1.033
Fg: 1.009
Yeast: S-04 and bottle carbed to 2vol CO2

1900g marris otter
317g caramunich 2
221g flaked oats
126g chocolate malt
31g black patent
Mashed at 64C for 60 min, brewers friend predicts 5,14 mash ph. 
""batch sparged"" twice by dunking the grainbag in 3 liter of 76C water. 

Boiled for 60 min
21,5g 4,7% EKG @60
6,33g irish moss @15

Fermented with a fermenter temp of 18C.

Water chemistry (ppm) 
57 Ca
69 Cl
67 so4
88 hco3

I percieved this beer as watery, thin and flavourless and i want to improve it. Primarily wanting to increase maltyness and mouthfeel. I am thinking of upping the mash temp to 68C and the mash ph to 5,4 with calcium carbonate. In addition to this i think i will sligthly increase the grainbill to account for the higher fg and increase abv to 3,5%. What do yall think of that? 

In addition to that i have heard that toasted oats are good for increasing malty biscuity flavours, do you have any experience with this and what % of grainbill would you use? I might also increase the black patent for more roasty flavours but i am afraid of acrid contributions. 

Is caramunich ok for this style or should i get some crystal 120? What in the flavour would this change? 

For yeast i have S-04 and notty. Do you have any opinions on what is best for this beer?",Homebrewing

Keg line balancing,"Keg line balancing Hi!

I am having trouble balancing my kegline and am quite confused. Please redirect me if there is a better sub.

Anyway, I have pretty standard IPA that I want to serve with decent carbonation, but nothing crazy. I'm aiming for roughly 14 psi, which, ok, is on the high side.

I'm serving with a picnic tap, so about a foot above the keg.

I had been using a 10 foot line of 3/16"" line, nothing fancy (though I bought it a long time ago). I find the beer very foamy in the glass. I can get it to a decent place if I raise my hands up over my head, absorbing some of the pressure.

When I do the calculations, they say I should be using 4.16 feet of tubing. That seems like it will have way too little resistance and cause even more foam.

I get
LENGTH = (KEG PRESSURE -1 -(HEIGHT/2))/RESISTANCE
L= (14 - 1 -.5)/3
L= 12.5/3
LENGTH = 4.1666

Is my resistance off? I'm so confused. I thought with my experience, I'd be better off with a longer tube, but calculating much shorter!

What length of tubing do you guys use?",Homebrewing
Setup of Used Regulator,"Setup of Used Regulator I bought a used regulator off the person who sold me the CO2 tank and it is missing a few parts. From what I gather I need a High pressure gauge and a CO2 inlet nut. 

What I am confused about is the CO2 inlet nipple. It seems most nipples I see are a threaded end with a long shaft and a part that fits onto the screw portion of the CO2 tank secured with the nut. This regulator appears to be an extender that I would hookup with another regulator for multiple kegs, is that correct?

Do I just need to buy a new nipple and a CO2 nut to be able to hook up directly to the keg?

Sanke couple on receiving keg with valves removed.  Gas port on receiving keg has a gas line to valve on the end buried in liquid during the transfer.  I plan on inserting the spunding gauge/valve on that gas line.  First question is what are others using for pressue for these type of transfers, and what is a good differential in pressure to maintain beween sending and receivng kegs?

Liqueur Crafting: Difference between Grain Alcohol (90°~) and Spirits (Vodka/Brandy/Rum/etc) for Maceration?,"Liqueur Crafting: Difference between Grain Alcohol (90°~) and Spirits (Vodka/Brandy/Rum/etc) for Maceration?    Pretty much the title. Grain Alcohol usually has a higher alcohol proportion, so I can only assume it's a better solvent, therefore it would be better for maceration of fruits and herbs, as it would extract more flavors and aromatics more easily and quickly. Also, it would be easier to control the alcohol content in the final Liqueur.

   So, is there any reason for using less-concentrated spirits for maceration and general liqueur-making?

Tips for increasing extraction efficiency?,"Tips for increasing extraction efficiency? I used to hover around 50%, according to Brewhouse's calculations. 

Today I used 5.3kg Munich malt, with 250 grams caramunich and 200 grams oat flakes with 20 liters of water at a ph of 7.3. 

Added them at 35 degrees C, and increased to 69 degrees at a speed of a bout 2 degrees per minute. 

Immediately after adding the grains, ph lowered to 5.8.

I added 2ml of phosphoric acid as I thought my ph wouldn't be acidic enough and my ph at 69 degrees was 5.10, a bit lower than I hoped. (next time I'll add less acid) I mashed at 69C for 60 minutes.

For those with experience with the SS Brew Buckets, about how many inches of compacted trub, yeast, and hop matter can I expect?  My pickup tube is currently level with the ground and I can pull samples of beer that are fairly clear, but I'm still at fermentation temp and I only have 1/2 the amount of hops in there.  Would people advise aiming my rotatable pickup tube straight up after the cold crash before transferring?  I'm still getting used to a stainless fermenter... not being able to see what's happening is a challenge...  Just curious if people have experience with this set-up and what has worked for them.",Homebrewing

**First Cut Attempt #1**

My take on Troeg’s First Cut. Doing two, one-hour BRIAB sessions for better attenuation. Aiming for at least 6.2% ABV and 45 IBU, but not opposed to a higher abv percent. 

**WHAT I KNOW ABOUT FIRST CUT:**

\- Uses Crystal, Pilsner and Munich malts

\- Official site claims that it uses just comet and simcoe hops, but past promotional material mentions mosaic as well. 

\- Some Untappd entries for the scratch version of it mention only simcoe in secondary. Would I only use simcoe in secondary and just comet for boil and whirlpool? Maybe.

\- Mangoes used at some point. Probably a secondary edition (5 pounds a good starting point with dryhops?)

Target OG: 1.06-1.08 range, but not too picky if it tastes good.

Target FG: 1.01

Belgian dubbel has hit FG.. When to bottle &amp; ABV questions,"Belgian dubbel has hit FG.. When to bottle &amp; ABV questions Okay, I know the obvious answer is ""if it's finished, it's good to go""..... but is it?

Firstly, the yeast attenuated more than I had expected, giving me a 9% ABV beer rather than 8% (which is already quite high for a dubbel). In taking various measurements through hydrometers and refractometers and plugging them into the Northern Brewer website, I get [three different answers](https://imgur.com/a/fCMsvIq) for possible ABV. Interestingly, 1.016 was my target FG, but I trust the hydrometer more (yes, they're all calibrated correctly). But should I be paying attention to any of the other outputs?

The beer smells gorgeous. I've just finished a dry week, so I'm sipping the sample I took for the hydrometer very slowly. I get some nice flavours from it (peppery/spicy, slight floral, some dark fruit &amp; bready), but I do wonder if it could be rounded out more and if a dubbel would benefit from longer in the fermenter? It's only been 10 days so far. Or do I want to bottle it ASAP to keep most of the yeast, as the yeast form an important part of such a style, rather than letting them settle at the bottom. The alcohol burn is also real on this beer, I've never understood it when people mentioned it before, but this is.. Wow. It isn't hidden. So, again, would letting it sit for a little bit longer (I won't bottle until Sat/Sun earliest anyway, taking me to the 2 week mark). 

Due to the cold temperatures here in the UK, I now have the capability to cold crash in our conservatory. Is this something that would be recommended, or should I skip this because I want the yeast in the beer (though I appreciate cold crashing doesn't get rid of all the yeast).

"Help name my (probably unsuccessful) first ever homebrew, an introduction","Help name my (probably unsuccessful) first ever homebrew, an introduction So, ever since craft beer started to blow up here in Alberta and my latent alcoholism could be easily spun as a cool new hobby, I’ve had making my own rattling around the back of my head. Well, on Friday I finally pulled the trigger and made a pit stop after my weekly grocery trip to pick up some gear for brewing. 


Turns out the only shop within 150km in any direction of me is more interested in selling extract kits than they are in helping a complete newbie build even the most basic of brew-in-a-bag setups for all-grain brewing. So I bought the things I thought I needed, including unmilled grains, hops, and yeast. 


And because I didn’t research any recipes before I bought grains, it turns out I had about half the base malt I needed and a whole bunch of other malts that I need in much smaller quantities than the 1kg bags they came in. Undeterred I decided to roll with it and see what comes out. And considering I’ve never done anything like this before in my life (aside from some lactofermented hot sauces, and one try at a sourdough starter a few years ago that I binned when it started to smell like blue cheese) I’m not expecting anything out of my first round aside from learning the process. 


And here’s where I need help. My beer needs a name. For good luck. Because if it has a name, it’ll be more likely to succeed. Or I’ll be more likely to drink it. One or the other. 


This was my process and ingredients for an 11L batch:

Grains: 

- Munich: 1kg
- Crystal 40: 500g
- Briess Carapils: 500g
^(all of the above was “milled” with a food processor because the brewing store doesn’t stock grain mills nor do they do any milling on site. 10/10 would not recommend. also, I saved my 2-row for the next brew, which was apparently the only proper base malt I bought. if this one’s gonna be a fuckup, at least round 2 will have *some* sort of proper ingredients.)


Hops:

- Centennial: 15g for 90min
- Fuggle: 15g for 30min
- Saaz/Fuggle 15g each for 5min post-boil


Strike water was 10L at 72C, for a mash temp of 67C for an hour. I sparged with 4L at 76C, then boiled for 90min, at 97C (boiling temp at my elevation). 


Specific gravity was 1.033, original gravity was 1.041 (I took gravity readings for the wort pre-and-post boil, am I doing that right?). I cooled my wort outside in a snow bank because the brewing store didn’t have a wort chiller and they didn’t know what I was talking about when I described it to them. I have one being shipped right now. It took 70 minutes to get from 90C to 22C. Does this matter? I don’t know. 


I pitched the yeast 26 hours ago, Saflager S-23, and it’s sitting in the primary fermenter right now at a steady 18C. Secondary fermentation will happen in my cold room that keeps a steady 11C. 


So, here we are, 26 hours in, and my beer is bubbling away. Now that I know I didn’t kill the yeast and that my half-baked attempt at brewing is going to produce *something*, I’m curious about three things:


1. What do I call it?
2. Guesses on flavour profile for my abomination?
3. How soon is too soon to start another?

Help needed Keg configuration.,"Help needed Keg configuration. Hi folks, so a friend of mine owns a bar and he's given me the loan of some gas and a keg to fill. The Keg is a guinness 'U' type 30 litre sanke keg. But the gas is where it gets interesting it's a 50/50 beer gas mix of co2 and nitrogen. I'm about to order a [regulator](https://www.iedepot.ie/nitrogen-regulator) and a [coupler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zerodis-Coupler-Stainless-Hotels-Restaurants/dp/B08KS5K9Y9/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=u+type+coupler&amp;qid=1606696580&amp;sr=8-2) along with some lines as well as a plastic dispenser tap. 

I'm just wondering if there's any thing else I need to watch out for, and also could do with advise on carbonating with the 50/50 mix, I've seen advice that you just double the pressure, but I'm a bit lost and research online isn't offering conclusive instructions for this setup. Also, force carbonation isn't a priority, I'm happy to let it sit in a cool room at 8C for a week or two so lower pressures wouldn't be a problem. Also do I need to leave the keg hooked up to the tank for the time of carbonation or can I just pressurise and uncouple it? Would a dispenser tap handle the pressure?

All advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated to wrap my head around this and pull the trigger on ordering the kit needed. Cheers.",Homebrewing

Brett primary spoilage (Perry),"Brett primary spoilage (Perry) I had about 10kg of pears and some White labs Brett that needed to be used, so I blended up the pears in a sanitized food processor dumped them into a sanitized 30l bucket, popped the top and airlock on and let it bubble for about a week. 

This was a very young Perry (probably should have gone three weeks) but I wanted to follow the progress, so decided to put it through the cider press after about a week or so. 

When I opened the top there were three tiny spots of white (mold?) on the floating pomme mash. I skimmed    5mm of the mash off the top with a clean spoon and discarded it. I saw no other growth so I assumed that whatever it was hadn’t penetrated the surface. 

I pressed the whole thing through a cheese cloth and into capped bottles. 


It was much closer to juice than Perry, barely alcoholic and very sweet, but the flavor was phenomenal: like racehorse sweat if racehorses sweat emoticons and jolly ranchers. 

Had half the batch over the next week. 

Now it looks like there may be some little white flecks growing on the surface of the remaining bottles. It’s too soon to know if it’s Kham’s yeast or mold, but, nonetheless, somethings there that shouldn’t be, which leads me to my question:

When using brettanomyces as the primary yeast, how do you minimize spoilage microbes? I assume in my case that the yeast didn’t raise CO2 or ethanol content fast enough (or that it didn’t drop the ph in the pomme mash; guess I should have stirred?). I know I can pair it with Sacc but I’d rather see how the profile of the Brett develops on the fruit. Maybe I could have added a neutral grain spirit to the mix early on for additional buffer?",Homebrewing

2021 NHC Update,"2021 NHC Update I’m excited to share some news with you about the 2021 National Homebrew Competition: It’s happening!It broke our hearts when we had to cancel the 2020 competition just as it was set to get underway. Not having that annual tradition for our hundreds of dedicated judges and volunteers and our thousands of entrants left a hole in the spring and summer.But you know that saying about lemons and lemonade? Well, we took homebrew competition entries for a canceled competition and made hand sanitizer for essential workers. Since then, we’ve learned a few things. First, hand sanitizer is great, but nothing beats a homebrew. Second, we never want to cancel NHC again.With uncertainty forecasted for 2021, we are doing everything we can to ensure NHC happens. After all, if you’re like us, you’ve probably been brewing more than ever. And the judges in your quarantine bubble might be suffering from palate fatigue.We will bring you the best NHC ever. Here’s how we plan to do that.

In 2021, all NHC entries will be judged from our refrigerated warehouse in Colorado.

This September, many of us at the AHA helped execute the safe judging of more than 9,000 entries at the Great American Beer Festival® with no COVID transmission. We will be applying what we learned to run the NHC using the Great American Beer Festival competition model.

We want to get you the best experience ever, so we’ll be partnering with Great American Beer Festival judges and BJCP certified judges to execute the competition.

We typically judge about 1,300 entries for the NHC final round. This year, we’ll be ready to evaluate upwards of 5,000 entries.

In order to make this event possible, we will be increasing the entry fee to $29 per entry. The increase will allow us to conduct all of the judging in one place and to take necessary health and safety precautions.We understand that 2020 has been a challenging year for many. One silver lining is that many of us have had the chance brew a few more batches, and maybe even share a few beers with friends. Our community is important to us, and ensuring the competition happens in 2021 is an important part of building that community. We invite you to hone your favorite recipe and share it with us next year. 

Cheers,John Moorhead
Competition ManagerP.S. The changes made to the competition are independent of Homebrew Con 2021. More information on Homebrew Con will be announced in January.

"Hey, water chemistry matters","Hey, water chemistry matters Just sharing a story about my experience with water chemistry. Maybe some people will have a better day knowing that all of us can struggle from time to time, others might be able to benefit from my learning experience. 

So, I've been brewing for a while. Probably about a decade at this point. I'd gone through all the phases, and my most recent one was doing BIAB, fermenting in 5 gallon corny kegs, and serving in 3 gallons. It was a sweet time. I was travelling a lot, and this setup was able to go anywhere I did. Quite literally, I brought it on a plane to Italy when I was living there. At any rate, I settled down, bought a house, and somehow ended up with a local brewery's pilot system. I had been using RO water and chemistry adjustments for a while. But with this new system, I was making more beer, and my two 5 gallon water jugs didn't quite get me all the water I needed. 

For most batches, I was needing 11 to 12 gallons of water. So, I would get 10 gallons of RO at the grocery store and top off with 1 gallon of well water. Well, all of the initial batches of my new, expensive system sucked. Like, bad beer, man. All beers had this awful, lingering bitterness that was not hops. I blew 3 or 4 batches of just barely drinkable, bitter crap. It was pretty upsetting; I had gone from making pretty decent beer on a very basic setup, to making very bad beer on a complicated setup that I splurged on. I was willing to try anything, and, on a Hail Mary, I bought a small RO system for the house, so I could always have as much RO as I wanted. Without that 1-2 gallon top off, my beer was back to normal. 

The TLDR/conclusion here is that just 10% of your water being not up to brewing standards can really get you. I encourage anyone getting into brewing to go with RO as not to be potentially discouraged. I've run out of brewing salts before, and straight RO water makes fine beer (there are exceptions, of course). It'll be better than what I was putting out with a ratio of 10:1 RO to tap, anyway.",Homebrewing

Mash water volume (water/grain ratio) - new all grain brewer missing the mark.,"Mash water volume (water/grain ratio) - new all grain brewer missing the mark. Recently upgraded my hot side to a fancy single vessel set up from Spike. I was using a large pot on the stove. I would mash in with just 3 gallons and at the end - after the boil and transfer to the fermenter - I would add cold water to bring the volume up to target and lower temperature. 

On the new single vessel, I can fit all of the water (including predicted losses) with all of the grain into the kettle.

This obviously shifts the grain water ratio - and I’m left wondering if this has unintended changes to the mash. 

This last beer I brewed was my first all grain batch, and on the new kettle. Like any good scientist I decided to change multiple variables. 

7.78 gal water
11.4lbs of grain (only milled once).

I did a step mash
122 15 min
145  30 min
158 30 min

I did a vorlaugh for 20 minutes
Did a whirlpool and transfer.

Checked my starting gravity....and only 1.021
I entered crisis mitigation mode and added DME to raise the gravity to my target 1.049


-first all gain batch (been brewing hybrid batches 50/50)
-first step mash ( I’ve been doing a single infusion)
-first run on the new kettle
-first time having target volume in kettle with grain

I’m looking for help and a general discussion on what people have found helps with efficiency. I’m going to check the kettle temp with a calibrated thermometer to ensure the temperature accuracy. I almost wonder if I need to add a temp probe to the grain basket to see the difference in temperature measured by the element to the water temp coming out of the pump into the basket. 

I wonder if I need to adjust the mill - or simply mill twice. 

I didn’t check mash PH before adding grain or through out process - I added that to my check list.

A week on I'm finally ready to share the mishaps from my 1st all grain brew day,"A week on I'm finally ready to share the mishaps from my 1st all grain brew day It has been a week since I used my new BrewZilla to make my first ever all-grain brew, and it’s taken me that long to own up to how it went, but I’ve decided to share my toils with you, for your entertainment and to reinforce my lessons learned. 

So the batch I wanted to do was called 'War Priest', taken from Acquisitions Intoxicated, who designed the recipe on their Twitch stream, and based it on one of the characters from the D&amp;D game. The layers of nerding out going on here is something I can’t go past, and would highly recommend [Acquisitions Intoxicated](https://youtu.be/7v_dJC0AKD8), along with the forbearer D&amp;D game [Acquisitions Incorporated](https://youtu.be/j_fGKY44DaI), to anyone willing to give it a whirl. 

War Priest a **big** beer - a Black IPA aiming at over 8% ABV and 80 IBU. Here's [my Brewfather recipe](https://share.brewfather.app/xuXq2xoiGUUCjF) for it (slightly tweaked from what I actually did for that batch, but not hugely...yet)  

I was (stupidly) aiming for a 23L ferment, which from everything I read about the BrewZilla was near the limits of the grain bill size the 35L vessel will take, but not over it... So fuck it, I went with that rather than scaling down a few litres... because what's the worst that could happen? 

A few notes before I regale you with tails of my woes: 

* I decided to use a BIAB bag underneath the malt pipe for extra filtration, based on the setups from others that I’ve seen online 
* I ordered the grain bill double milled (ie for BIAB) 
* I did not use rice hulls
* the ""[Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Mash Paddle](https://www.kegland.com.au/stainless-steel-mash-paddle-heavy-duty.html)"" from Kegland might be appropriately sized for the 65L version, or for an oversized stock pot feeding the entire crew of an aircraft carrier, but in the 35L BrewZilla it is comically large, almost unusable (learn from me and ignore that piece of advice - stick with a normal sized one!)

Last weekend I finally got time for a brew day, after sitting on the grains and my brand new BrewZilla for over a week. I had tested bringing water up to a boil, and using the immersion chiller, so that I would be comfortable with the process. 

I had also built the recipe into Brewfather, which gave me all sort of information about the process which seemed incredibly helpful. In hindsight, however, I didn’t know some of the intricacies of the tool, including the Equipment settings and volume limits... What resulted was me having to remove about 4L of mash water to add to the sparge before putting the grains in because I knew it wouldn't fit otherwise. That amount was pretty much perfect, with the BrewZilla tapped out in terms of capacity, and the density of the mash being unpleasant to stir.... (particularly with the 10 tonne mash paddle that couldn't fit sideways in the malt pipe around the middle tube....)

But mash went reasonably, and the colour and smell was perfect, so I'm feeling okay at this stage. So I move onto sparging, using every ounce of strength to be able to pull the malt pipe out of the wort and twist it onto the little ledge thing to drain.

Based on my lack of rice hulls, the ultra fine milling of the grains, and probably the fact that I forgot to recirculate the wort through the mash process, the sparge kept getting stuck. Queue montage of me in my laundry/garage, standing over the BrewZilla, which was propped up on a chair to get better air flow, with the malt pipe resting on top, using the worlds larges mash paddle to gentle try to help the sparging process along... I manage to get almost the whole way through this, having put in all of the sparge water (and extra taken out pre mash), only to make the fatal mistake of not paying enough attention to where the malt pipe 'feet' were on the rails at the top of the kettle. When stirring the incredibly thick grist I must have twisted the malt pipe too much, because malt pipe plus 8.25kg of grain and whatever water weight it had picked up come crashing down back into the wort, splashing about 4L of wort over me, the walls, the washer/dryer, and the whole garage....

From there I was able to pretty quickly pull the malt pipe back out, hose myself down, and start the long process of cleaning the garage thoroughly to remove (what I hope is) all of the sugary, sticky wort that flooded it, but at the end of the process the BrewZilla wasn't having a bar of it, and refused to turn on the heating elements. It took a solid 4 hours of it drying off before I had any luck getting it going again. 4 hours during which I was beating myself up for breaking my brand new brewing tool that I’d bought as a graduation present for myself, in the first day out of the box! 

But thankfully, after that I was able to complete the brew days otherwise uneventfully. The final product was about 19L of wort in the fermenter that has been bubbling away all week, and I expect will be ready to keg this weekend, at which point I'm planning to brew a [Witbier](https://share.brewfather.app/0BWxkjE21wGRPs), learning from many of the mistakes from last time...

I hope me owning up to this helps someone avoid a similar fate, or at least makes a few of you laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR – very full malt pipe fell back into the wort at the end of the sparge, sending several litres of hot, sugary mess all over me, my laundry/garage, and my brand new BrewZilla. Thankfully, after a few hours of drying out, the BrewZilla started working again, and I was able to complete a slightly smaller batch in the end.",Homebrewing

I've noticed that no matter how hard I look I can't duplicate that taste in anything other than a Heff that is brewed in Germany (Paulaner, Ayinger, ect.) 

So onto my question, is there something that really separates the German  Heffs over ones made here in the States? I'm brewing my first Heff kit this week I'm not sure what I can do to make the quality higher. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",Homebrewing

Hop palette fatigue?,"Hop palette fatigue? So this is a little bit outside of the normal technical and process questions that others and myself usually ask here. For a few years now I’ve been chasing the mythical perfect New England IPA. I have become a much better brewer in that time and have refined my processes all over the place from cold side oxidation to water chemistry. There’s one thing that I feel is constantly screwing me up... I don’t think I like any of the beers that I make. 

My friends and family enjoy them, but I am kind of ambivalent to them. They’re never able to live up to what I want them to be. Maybe it’s because I have been lucky to have been able to try some of the worlds “best” IPAs and drink pretty much nothing but very hopped up, and most of the time hazy style beers from professionals. I love various beer styles, but I am absolutely a hop head. So my question is… Am I just not able to taste and smell what others think is really good? Over this Thanksgiving break, I gave my parents and sister samples of my beer and samples of another beer that I really enjoy. I didn’t tell him which one is which. All of them picked my beer. 

The point is I think I have possibly overloaded my palate with extremely hoppy and very well-made hoppy beers. Is this what I’ve heard called hop fatigue? Is that a thing? What do I do to get back to objectively tasting and smelling all the hard work I put into my beers? 

I’m thinking of stopping drinking hop heavy beers for a little while and go to the extreme malty end or something.",Homebrewing

8 month old quad is starting to hit it's stride!,"8 month old quad is starting to hit it's stride! https://i.imgur.com/1hdIXz1.jpg

Bready and complex with figs and pepper. Fairly dry and refreshing. Effervescent and slightly prickly with alcohol warmth and a medium-light body. Rocky, tan head dissipates after about a minute.

During aging, it lost a little heat and gained a little dried fruit, as well as the flavor becoming more prominent and less muddy.

5.5 gal batch is 16 lbs belgian pilsner, 2.5 lbs d-180 candi syrup. Mash schedule is 60m at 144f, 30m at 150f. First gallon of runnings decocted and boiled separately into a rich mahogany syrup, roughly down to 20% volume. 90m boil. Bittered to 35 IBUs with 1 oz styrian goldings at 15m. Imperial B63 yeast. 64f pitch, raised 2f per day to 80f. 1.098 og to 1.011 fg. Naturally carbonated to 3.2 volumes. Around 12.5% ABV after natural carbonation.

All in all a fantastic beer, but I will be making some changes next time. After doing a side by side with westy, I think I would drop the abv down to 10%ish, use 1 lb d-180, 1 lb d-90, a small touch of special b, work on head retention, and lower the carbonation.",Homebrewing

Scottish Wee heavy problems,"Scottish Wee heavy problems Hello All,

I brewed a Scottish wee heavy and it was a problem from the start. This was my first high gravity extract beer and a few lessons were learnt , anyhow , after 3 weeks of fermenting , it’s finally stopped . OG was a massive 1.113 , and it’s now at 1.065. I reckon the Yeast has finally run out of gas. I had yeast problems initially. 

Anyway, I am going to assume 1.065 is still way to high , however , I did squeeze and rinse the hell out of the steeping bags. Is it possible the current high gravity is due to the large amount of unfermentable sugars from my excessive squeezing every last drop out of the special malts ?

Pitched NEIPA with wrong yeast,"Pitched NEIPA with wrong yeast Hello everyone! This is my first post here, but I've been lurking for some time already and gotta say, this is one of my favourite subs that I follow as people here are so chill and friendly. 

So, I was brewing a sort of NEIPA with my makeshift recipe that I had made once before and which I thought that was pretty okay so I wanted to start improving it. The FU happened when I was pitching the yeast in. I had two jars of yeast in my fridge, and as I am simple person with memory capacity of a bee, I didn't mark the jars for what they contain. Another one was WhiteLabs Vermont Ale, that I used in previous batch and another one was  WhiteLabs German Lager that I used for pilsner. So when it was time to take the yeast out of the fridge, without hesitation I took the jar that I thought was the Vermont Ale yeast and proceeded with that. Next day it just suddenly crossed my mind that I must have taken the wrong yeast. The one that I took was in such a pickle jar that we hadn't ever bought home. I fermented the pilsner at my parents cellar as it has constant temperature of 13C, so pretty okay for pilsner, right. So now I have beer, that was supposed to be sort of a NEIPA fermenting with German lager yeast at 20C. 

The question is, what kind of outcome you would expect of this batch with lager yeast that is fermenting way above its optimal temperature range? Also the last batch had fermented just in time for trip to summer cottage, so I did not have time to dry hop it before it was all gone. Do you think the amount of hops is decent for the beer style? Is there other modifications to this recipe that would make it more like the style it is poorly trying to mimic?

My Imperial Stout never carbonated,"My Imperial Stout never carbonated Hello to everyone,

  
I have made an imperial stout 9.5% abv that was on primary fermentation for 8 days and then on secondary for 14 days. After that, I bottled and I primed with dextrose so as to have 2.0 CO2. Well, after 20 days there is no sign of carbonation and the temperature is 20C, I have never faced something similar even when I had used gelatin. I suppose that all the yeast cells had settled down and none went into the bottles.

Brewing for hours allows me to get disconected of my responsabilities, think about life things while I wait for the mash to finish, or the wort to get chilled. I always have an idea of something new to try to brew, a new style, a new recipe, a new beer experiment, or a DIY piece of a equipment I would like to build.

Have any of you gone through something like this? Feels very weird, really.

cider doesn't taste like alcohol?,cider doesn't taste like alcohol? I have been fermenting cider in 3 1-gallon containers with regular airlocks. I transferred one gallon to bottles and added sugar in some of them to carbonate but noticed that some foam (krausen?) must have overflowed into the airlock since there seemed to be some sticky residue when I took it off. I tried a bit when I did that and just now tried some from a bottle that I didn't have the priming sugar. Both times I tried it it didn't have that warmth that wine has that I think comes from alcohol. instead it has a rotten flavor. could the sugar have been turned in to something else instead of alcohol? I only drank probably a cup or less total but I didn't get sick or anything. I guess it could be my imagination too but I don't think so.,Homebrewing

Determining off-taste in blue moon clone,"Determining off-taste in blue moon clone Hey all,

I made this popular [blue moon clone](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/blue-balls-belgian-wit-blue-moon-clone.24978/) last month. Just kegged it on Monday and had my first sips today and it's the first beer since all grain that I've been really disappointed with, and may have to dump. So I figured I'd try to get to the bottom of it here. There is just this extremely bitter and tangy taste, hardly tastes like beer. The only thing I can think of is that there was too much orange peel OR because I didn't put the orange peel into a muslin bag, instead I just dumped into the kettle and let the carboys sit for about a month? Recipe below...

I made it into an 8.6gal batch (I always do around 9 gal batches because anything more and when I BIAB the grain overflows out of my 15gal kettle) and scaled with beersmith. Recipe as follows:

6lbs 14.4oz flaked wheat

10 lbs 2 row

1.9 oz Willamette

1.29oz Coriander

1.29oz Orange peel, bitter

OG - 1.044, FG - 1.005 (my refractometer was acting up so not 100% accurate on the FG... I need a tilt)

There are 3 slight deviations from the original recipe. The first is the scaling to a bigger batch. Second thing you will notice is my ratio of wheat and 2row is off. I noticed last minute I didn't have enough flaked wheat so I said screw it and just increased the amount of 2 row. 3rd thing is I used Willamette as a sub for Goldings.

Lastly, this is the first batch that I started with RO water and made my own mineral profile, so I could have done this horribly wrong.

Overall, I think it has something to do with the orange peel. Maybe orange peel doesn't scale well in beersmith when increasing batch size? Or maybe the orange peel doesn't work as well with less flaked wheat? Maybe my water profile was off and made it extremely bitter/tangy?

Any suggestions at all, please share!",Homebrewing

1. It appears to have stopped fermenting as there is no activity in the fermenter that I can see anymore even though I'm just under 2 weeks in to the ferment - I felt when I started that I underpitched the yeast so I thought think may have been a cause?
2. I've checked the gravity and it had a gravity of 1.060 when I started the ferment and it now has 1.028 - is that a normal level at this point in the ferment?
3. I tasted a small amount when I checked the gravity and it has quite an alcoholic flavour despite it being only 4.20% (assuming my gravity reading is accurate) I've done some research and I think it may be due to fermenting it at too high a temperature - is there a way to reduce this in the final beer?

Can/should I add more yeast if I screwed up hydrating my dry yeast?,"Can/should I add more yeast if I screwed up hydrating my dry yeast? Hey, definite noob here, but want to see if anyone has some advice for me in my situation. First time brewing in almost a decade.

Used an extract kit ([Brewer's Best, Imperial Nut Brown](http://brewersbestkits.com/assets/1048_imperialnutbrown_recipe.pdf)) today, and everything went swimmingly during my boil, I cooled my wort down fast with an immersion chiller, and decided to try rehydrating my yeast packet ([this one](https://kamiljuices.com/products/windsoraleyeast)). For some reason, though I knew to warm up the water beforehand, I neglected to do so (used cold brita water). The yeast didn't bubble up at all in the starter glass, and I'm not sure how much action it's had since adding it to the fermenter. I figure I probably killed off a bunch of the yeast by putting it dry into cold water.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Apologies if this question has been asked a bunch, but I wasn't able to find something relevant with a quick search and am hoping to know what to do before it's too late.",Homebrewing

Off Flavor Help: Dish Soap Flavor,"Off Flavor Help: Dish Soap Flavor All, I need help on what went wrong with my Altbier. The brew day went well for me hit all my numbers and fermentation was normal. 

I utilized RO water and adjusted with minerals accordingly. Performed a multi-step mash and a 90 min boil. Fermented with 1007 German Ale. 

Fermentation finished up in about 7 days (3 Gallon batch). I moved it to secondary to lager for 3 weeks. I pulled a sample during the initial transfer and the beer had no malt/hop flavor at all, I thought it was very odd.  At that time I noticed the beer had a dish soap flavor to it and hoped it would go away with time. It hasn’t :(

I clean everything with PBW, never with dish soap! 

Googled the off-flavor but what I read that describes “soap” does not seem to be my issue, long storage of the beer on the trub.

The grains were about 2 weeks old from the time I got them milled and was able to brew. Could this be a culprit? And why doesn’t the beer have any flavor, it’s almost flat tasting, zero malt or hop flavor. 

I’ve been brewing for a few years now and never had this issue, so any help would be appreciated.",Homebrewing

Idea for a radiator immersion chiller,"Idea for a radiator immersion chiller Hello, dear brewers.

My vocabulary isn’t all that great when it comes to homebrewing, but I’ll do my best to try and explain my idea to you.

So basically me and my dad have been having some issues with our DYI immersion cooler. It didn’t work as effectively as we had hoped it would, meaning that we had to pump the wort super slowly in order to reach the right temperature.

We’ve been back and forth trying to solve this issue, and dad thinks he might be able to improve the effect by increasing the length of the immersion cooler by 3 meters or so.

My idea however, is a bit different. Now I know what you think, but this is NOT just another guy who thinks simply running the wort through a radiator would solve problem. I do not intend to die of lead poisoning. 

What do you think about replacing the water that usually runs through the immersion cooler, with a coolant, and then run the coolant through a radiator?",Homebrewing

Biscoff lemon cheesecake(?) Sour,"Biscoff lemon cheesecake(?) Sour Thought i would share my first original recipe which i have put on this weekend.

Started out as a straight lemon sour made from a post i found on reddit to test souring out. 4.5kg marris otter mashed then soured using sourpitch and kept at 32 degrees using a fishtank heater until ph hit 3.1 before boiling, lemon peel @ 10 mins and fermented out with us 05.

Trial went well but it was very straight, sharp and sour. Wanted to add more of a dessert feel to it so i have added 250g of biscuit malt and 500g of biscoff biscuits to the mash along with 250g of toasted oats for a creamy mouthfeel.  Soured to 3.1 again and boiled for 60 min.

Hopped with 25g of cascade and simcoe and 50g of citra, 1/3 of these at 10 mins remaining along with lemon peels and 1/2 whirlfloc.

Will dry hop in secondary with the remaining 2/3 of hops and 500g of lactose to add to creaminess and give a base of unfermentable sweetness along with more lemon peels.

Smelled great going into the fermenter, i find sours take a while for fermentation to start but hopefully this will kick off later today.

I tried to return the 5 extra but they said to just keep them. I then had the problem if what to do with 18 liters worth of flasks, then I had an idea.

 I brewed a beer and split the batch into 6 two liter parts in each of the flasks. I then pitched 6 different yeasts to ferment in the flasks. I let them ferment out, bottled and conditioned the brews (4 bottles per flask). 

 The end result was that I got to taste all these beers, with the only difference being the yeast used, head to head to see which I preferred. I know this isn't shocking research to most of you, but the difference was amazing. This allowed me to choose the exact yeast I want to use for this beer moving forward to get the best results for my tastes. 

The truly exciting part for me was realizing the HUGE difference yeast selection can make in the final product!

Protecting electronics dangling in a fermenter,"Protecting electronics dangling in a fermenter I'm looking at dangling a couple [these pressure sensors](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mki183v1.html) inside a fermenter at different depths, in hopes that watching the difference between the two will indicate the SG of the brew, or even if it's not that accurate, the graph over time will tell me when the brew is done moving.

The sensor itself is gel potted and supposed to be able to survive chemicals - chlorinated water, beer. The circuit board, however, is most definitely not.

So I'm thinking of soldering it up, attaching a little snorkel to the sensor (that smokestack on it is about 2mm diameter), and then slathering it all with food-safe silicone.

I'm in Australia. Anyone have any idea where I can get/what kind of silicone to use?

Critique my recipe - Leftovers IPA,"Critique my recipe - Leftovers IPA Hey Brewers!

I thought I'd put this recipe out for critique to try and improve on what could be reasonable base. I'm calling this one Leftovers IPA. The reason for this is that I had some pelleted hops laying about and I wanted to get use out of them before they started to go off or get stale. Let me know what you think.

Ingredients:
2 × 1.7kg Cooper's Pale Ale LME
1 × 1kg Light DME
1 × 1kg Dextrose
45g Mosaic pelleted hops
50g Amarillo pelleted hops
55g Cascade pelleted hops

Method:
• Steriliser everything (obviously)
• Bring 3L of water to boil
• Once water is boiled, add 2 × 1.7kg Coopers Pale Ale LME, 1kg Light DME, 30g Mosaic, 30g Amarillo, 30g Cascade. Bring temp down to simmer and simmer for 30 mins.
• Add 1kg of Dextrose and stir untill dissolved.
• Add wort to fermenter and top up with cool water up to 23L.
• Once temperature is between 18-23°C, pitch yeast sachets that came with Pale Ale LME tins.

Day 4
• Add 15g Mosaic, 15g Amarillo, 15g Cascade.

Day 7
• Add 15g Cascade, 5g Amarillo.

OG was recorded at 1090
FG is yet to be determined as I broke my glass hydrometer.

Next time I'd add some Irish moss at the end of the boil for clarity. There's a strong resinous mouth feel and taste, but there's also some reasonable tropical aromas as well.

This is obviously a starting point that could either be improved or simply never be brewed again and burn all evidence that there was ever any attempt.

I only fermented for about 2 weeks. Cider was pretty dry, had some slightly funky aftertaste, but it was drinkable. Not particularly sparkling. 

Now, I've had a 4.5 gallon batch of cider going for almost 7 weeks in primary. I crushed and pressed a few different varieties of apples from a local orchard. I added raw honey as well, no water. I tasted it over the weekend and it's pretty decent- quite dry. Girlfriend doesn't like it as much as week two lol. 

I put my fermenter in the fridge today to cold crash the cider. My plan is to cold crash for 2 days, and then add 1 frozen apple juice concentrate as primer to the cider and let it dissolve. Then rack, to my bottling bucket, and bottle. I was going to put some in a plastic bottle to squeeze every day until it was firm, and then pasteurize all of the bottles. My goal is to have a strong, sparkling, slightly sweet cider, and from all my reading I think I have a decent plan?

Anybody have experience priming with apple juice concentrate? Anyone have good or bad experiendes with an extended primary and no secondary? Tips on pasteurizing?

P.S. I don't have any gravity readings- I just purchased a hydrometer, so in the future I'll be sciencing harder. Right now, I'm just going for ""about right""",Homebrewing

Stainless steel keg pasteurization process.,"Stainless steel keg pasteurization process. I wanted to share a pasturization process that I've been doing with good sucess using hot water. I'm only posting this because I've read a lot of posts saying that 1. it is not possible, or 2. not practical. For my purposes,  I do this to back sweeten my ciders and preserve them without restarting the fermentation process.  I like to age my ciders for a few months so they mellow out, and lastly I like to keep enough drink stored so I don't run out. So a shelf life is what I want without using additional chemicals. 

***ATTENTION***
I don't know if i need to put a disclaimer to tell people to be careful around extremely hot liquids and potentially heavy objects involved in the process. So with anything, please take extreme care when proceeding with the following if you were to try it. I am not liable for your injuries or damages to your equipment. I am sharing my experiences using my equipment at my own risk. So use your best judgment during the process. 
***ATTENTION***

The kegs involved are 5 one gallon stainless steel (SS) kegs, and two 5 gallon Northern Brewer SS kegs with rubber bottoms. The one gallons have a ball-lock system attached to the head during the process.

The smaller kegs will sit in a medium size pot filled with enough water a few inches from the top of the pot. The 5 gallon kegs will sit in an 8 gallon pot with the water line a few inches from the top as well. The top half to 1/3 of my kegs are not usually submerged. 

Bringing water to a boil, I'll take the pot off the heating element and slowly insert the keg. The temperature will start to drop rapidly as the keg warms up, usually setteling at about 140*F.  When the temperature of the water drops below 140*F, replace upto half of the water with fresh boiling water to bring it back up passed 160*F.

The pasteurization time and temperatures are 30 mins at ~140*F using the slow low temp method, and 15 seconds at ~160*F using the faster method according to this article by Britannica. [links here.](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pasteurization)
There are higher temperatures to pasteurize at, but i do not feel comfortable at higher than 170*F.

I will usually keep this up for 10 minutes, or until the top part of the keg that is not sumberged reads to about 160*F. At this point I am fairly confident that the cider is now pasteurized. I have done this and kept ciders for about 8 months now and have not had any restarted fermentation with added sugars, nor have I had any infections. 

As for the kegs, they both seem to be doing well and show that they can tolerate pasteurization temperatures. The rubber bottom on the 5 gallon kegs seem to be okay, without any obvious signs of ware. But i always figured i could just glue them back on again if they ever came off.

Time is a wonderful thing,"Time is a wonderful thing I was looking for some carpet cleaner and I stumbled upon 2 bottles I put in a closet almost 2 month  ago. I put them there because they were going to be my ""taste test"" bottles to see if they were ready to drink yet. As a new brewer, I find myself testing a bottle every week until I deem it acceptable and then consider it ""ready for consumption"". I remember these beers, I was really proud of them because they were the first 2 I was making the recipe on my own (not a kit) and started experimenting with hops. 

Simple Saaz and Simple Cascade. 

Oh boy, how much better these are after almost 2 months of bottle conditioning. The head still hasn't gone away after sitting for a few minutes and having drank half the glass. I remember drinking them when I decided they were ""ready"" and they had a little bitter bite to it. I just assumed that was the taste of those hops and how it's supposed to be. Now the flavors melded together into beautiful mellow while still crisp. Time is a wonderful thing.",Homebrewing

Speidel Cap + Gas Bulkhead Mod for Oxygen-Free Transfers,"Speidel Cap + Gas Bulkhead Mod for Oxygen-Free Transfers My usual fermentor to keg transfer involves a purged keg with silicone tubing  leading from my Speidel fermentor’s spigot straight to the bottom of my keg through the lid opening, with a cap loosely fitted to the top of my fermentor so as to not create a vacuum during transfer.  

I’ve noticed recently that less than 5 gallons of beer in my fermentor often leads to air getting sucked into the keg at the tail end of the transfer. Very likely a mixture of CO2 and oxygen. The latter not being so great for my hoppy beers. This cap with gas bulkhead mod helps alleviate that. I now hook up one line from my CO2 tank to my keg and one line to my fermentor pushing about 1-2 psi into both, with keg lid off and screw cap on Speidel loosely fitted. This helps mitigate, if not eliminate, any potential oxygen ingress by pushing any air out from both the fermentor and keg during transfer.  

Gas bulkhead from MoreBeer. Used a 1/2” hole punch on the cap to fit the bulkhead. Hope this helps someone out there!

Beer temperature and cloudiness,"Beer temperature and cloudiness Ok storytime/rant/question so beer with me.
its close to my 12th batch and I always serve my beer (bottle conditioned/ priming) at 4°c cause thats the way i like it, but my brother likes it stupidly cold and so he places it in the freezer for a couple hours max before drinkin(as much as he can get away with before it freezes solid) and its always been close to cristal clear, but now he got a temperature controlled beer fridge and he set the thing to -2°c and naturally leaves every bottle in there. All my bottles that stayed on that temperature for more than a day were never the same again. Its cloudy, and it has a flavour thats off but i cant quite put my finger on it. 
First thing i thought it was chill haze, but if that was the case it should return to normal after warming right? Also it should not affect flavour.
Now i think it might be dead yeast. But it if the water never actually crystallized it should not have damaged their cells walls.
Its driving me crazy my beer is good otherwise. Why is prolonged exposure to near freezing making it bad? why only after bottle conditioning and not during the cold crash? Why is it even popular to drink beer stupidly cold?",Homebrewing
Just finished my 2nd batch with all-in-one and I'm having trouble with water amount and/or boil-off rate,"Just finished my 2nd batch with all-in-one and I'm having trouble with water amount and/or boil-off rate So I just finished my 2nd batch with Brew monk (/hopcat) 30 liter version. I already made an excellent porter/stout and now I tried to make an quadrupel. I use the Brewfather app for amounts.

The Brew monk has a water level meter on the side, which I rely on. I measure my mashing water amount, pre-boil and boil amount with it. The thing is, when I sparge the water level indicator tells me it's missing a good amount of water. Today it was missing about 4 liters. So I sparged it with 4 liters more. This got me to preboil amount of about 26 liters as it should have, as I was aiming at 20 liters to fermenter. Well I brought it to boil and let it boil for an hour. The water level indicator said 24.5 liters and my fermenter agreed to that amount after I moved it to there, also gravity was way too low. So according to my masher the boil-off is about 1.5 liters/hour (that would be only  0.4 gallons/hour)

Same-ish thing happened with the 1st batch (It was a group thing, pre-made bewerages were supplied, so this isn't very scientific). It was sparging too low volume according to the Brew monk, and we sparged it a little bit more and again it resulted to too low gravity and bigger batch. As this was a lower ABV beer we managed to fix it a little with sugar and it turned out great.

TL;DR: I get too low pre-boil volume according to my masher's volume indicator, sparging more leads to said sparging water adding up to fermenter volume, **but** pre-boil volume is ok. Gravity is also too low.

PS. Can some one point me to a good non-biab sparging tutorial, that would be compatible with all-in-one malt pipe? I tried watching the grainfather video, but I don't feel like it told me what to actually do. Or I think I might have had stuck sparge twice now.",Homebrewing

Questions about infections. I'm sorry.,"Questions about infections. I'm sorry. Firstly, I'm not worried. This isn't a panic post. I am indeed relaxing and having a homebrew, but I still have some questions about infections.

So, I am aware that the cooldown period is when the wort is most vulnerable, and that keeping a sanitized lid on the pot is important. I'm confident that all my equipment was sanitized, and that the wort was poured into the fermenter without contamination. 
Brewday was on Saturday (11/21/2020), and the fermenter spent all of Sunday bubbling away, which I was glad to see. Forums outside of reddit say that the yeast have now established their ""reign"" at this point, and infections (that is, if enemies are present at all) are unlikely. It is also said that the alcohol produced will also help prevent infections. In this, I am also confident that there is *some* alcohol present in the fermenter, though probably not the amount I want for the final product (OG: 1.094; target FG: 1.013; 11.5g US-05 at a terrible 71°F).
However, I did take out the rubber stopper and the airlock because it was getting gunky. I took sanitizer and soaked the area around the hole before taking it out, and Star San'd the crap out of my hands, the stopper, and the airlock— especially the underside part that points inside the fermenter— before putting it back. I think I did a good job with sanitizing, and I think an infection is unlikely. 

Here are my questions: 

1. Is a whole day of bubbling a sign of a healthy fermentation, and should I be confident that the beer is doing fine and that infections have been avoided for now? 

2. Is it true that yeasts can establish their ""reign"" and prevent other microorganisms from taking over, or can infections occur at the same time as an active/healthy fermentation period? 

3. If other microorganisms take over before the yeast gets to work, should I be looking for signs like weak bubbling or no bubbling at all? This is assuming I maintain a proper temperature and added an appropriate amount of yeast.  

4. If on bottling day I discover an infection, is it worth scooping out that film of white fuzz that I seen in pictures of actual beer infections? I hate the idea of dumping 4 gallons of 2 weeks of my life and $30 worth of malt, so I was wondering if there are remedies to this problem. I also don't want to open the lid, so I really have no way of seeing what's happening inside (it's a white bucket). 

5. How much alcohol does it take to protect the fermentation process? Similarly, if the alcohol floats to the top, why do pictures of infections show the spread of bacteria *on the top* of the beer? I guess this question is linked to questions 2 and 3, but I'm not sure. 

That's all the questions I have for now, but I'll probably reply with more in the comments.

PSA: Refractometers/Hydrometers will have different accuracy levels depending on both temperature and alcohol content. Calculators provided within.,"PSA: Refractometers/Hydrometers will have different accuracy levels depending on both temperature and alcohol content. Calculators provided within. Simply put, alcohol interferes with the readings of a refractometer and temperature interferes with the accuracy of a hydrometer.    


Pre-fermentation you may be seeing different values between your hydrometer and refractometer because your probably testing the gravity of HOT wort. You'll need a [Hydrometer Temp Correction Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/hydrometer-temp/) to get a bit more accurate of a reading between the two. Refractometers normally have ATC (Automatice Temperature Correction) up to a certain degree (which is normally above normal mash temps, depending on the quality of your device).  

Post-fermentation may be showing different values between your devices because ALCOHOL interferes with the accuracy of a refractometer. In this scenario, you'll need to use your hydrometer (as normal fermentation temps are well within the temp range needed for accurate hydrometer readings) or use a [Refractometer Alcohol Correction Calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/refractometer-calculator/) to get a reading that would match your hydrometer.  

In short, some of the better advice you'll get is to use your refractometer during production and use your hydrometer post fermentation when you're doing your logs.

Murky Wort. Like really murky.,"Murky Wort. Like really murky. Hey folks, long time lurker first time poster. I’m a beginner/intermediate brewer.  Doing all grain a while now and finally brewing again after way to long of a break. I’ve been doing mash In a bag (full volume) and just standard batch sparge. One thing that has always bugged me is the fact that the wort coming out of my mash tun literally looks like dirty mud dishwater. I’ve done really fine crush and I’ve done coarse crush and no matter what, when I lift the brewbag out, the wort is pretty damn murky. From what I’ve read a lot of people don’t seem to think it’s a problem, but one reason I’m focusing on this right now is because I can’t seem to really get a nice compacted trub pile in my kettle before transferring to the fermenter. I end up with a giant pancake mess on the bottom and lose a whole lot of potential beer. Aside from that, those YouTube videos of people transferring clear work are just kind of sexy :-).

So as the title says this brew day is in the books but I’m hoping to avoid this again. I’ve had the e4 error before so I started using a bag in my mash. Didn’t help. I added a pump to my setup for recirculation. Still got got the error. I’m guessing everyone is going to say my crush is too fine (I mill my own grains, don’t double mill, and use a credit card thickness. The heat plate was sparkling clean and free of any debris when I started as well. Of course it had some scorched material after I finished. Missed my target gravity by 9 points because of this making my NEIPA a 1.056 instead of a 1.065. Thinking all I can do is crush less fine and save up for an electric brewery with a control panel that DOESNT have an e4 error. Made my brew day last about 3 hours longer than normal to get through my mash steps and had to batch sparge. Hating my BEM&amp;B right now. It’s 12:30 and I have to wake up with a toddler at 6.

Broken Thermometer,"Broken Thermometer So I’m coming here with basically a question, but also looking for some reassurance. I HAD a glass thermometer as you will see in the link, and I put it in the wort right before I was transferring to a bucket just to make sure the temp I was getting on the digiboil read out was accurate enough to pitch my yeast. As soon as I got it half way in the wort, I heard a *tink* and then a bunch of smaller tinks, which confused me. But after I thought about it for a second I pulled the thermometer out of the wort and sure as shit it had busted and dropped all the things out of the bottom. 

The thought of dumping it passed my mind, but screw that after just brewing for 5 hours. So I transferred to my bucket and pitched the yeast and all. 

My question is, what are those little beads and should I really worry about them/will they mess me up if i let them sit in primary for the next few weeks? 

I planned on just going on as usual, fermenting in primary a few weeks(I’m doing a tripel), cold crashing, and then transfer to a keg. Also I think it’s important to note when I was cleaning my kettle after, in the bottom I’m assuming was 90% + of those beads that fell out.

Jalapeño Pale Ale help,"Jalapeño Pale Ale help I grow my own hot peppers. Last few years I’ve made jalapeño beers.  First batch was an amazing saison (and I lost the recipe).  My last 2 batches were IPA’s that were good, but not great. First batch too sweet (1# of C60, 9# 2row, 1# wheat), and same with the second (0.77# of C40, 7.5# 2row, 1.33# wheat, .66# flaked wheat).  Second batch I mashed too high (153), so that I’m going to fix. 

I want to do something lighter (2nd batch was boozy).  But I want some bready backbone for the jalapeño flavor to grab.  And it needs to have some body so it doesn’t taste like jalapeño water. 

My recipe: 5# 2row, 2# wheat, 3# Munich light. Mash at 150f. 75min boil. Cascade to bitter (38IBU) and Saaz at FO for aroma. 2 jalapeño at 1min.  2 jalapeño in secondary.  

My question:  how much light Munich too much??  Should I inverse the wheat/Munich??

Not going to dry hop this one (did the other 2), because I’m hoping the peppers shine more.  So more of a pale ale vs IPA.

HEX Heat Exchanger and Automated Brewing,"HEX Heat Exchanger and Automated Brewing I had this idea a few days ago, and after a bit of searching found this old project: https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/pimp-my-system/hex/

For the homebrewer this should be just as effective as a HLT but much smaller (though I expect about the same cost).

I should say I'm a total amateur brewer (just a few BIAB batches) but I have a fair amount of automation, electrical and electronics experience. So assume I won't have any issues with the electrical/electronics side.

This is what I cam up with for an almost fully automated brewing system.
https://i.imgur.com/F0IHkIq.png

The HEX heat exchanger on the left would have a high wattage heater (possibly 9kw) it can pre-heat any incoming water (for this setup assume tap water) and direct it to the Mash Tun (or the Brew Kettle. Liquid from the Mash Tun can can be circulated though the HEX acting as a HERMS system. 

The hex can of course supply heated water for cleaning and circulated though everything before draining. 

I think this will allow an almost automated brew (aside from grain, hops etc). But I don't have any experience with thee pot brewing.",Homebrewing

Easy Non-Brew Hard Seltzer,"Easy Non-Brew Hard Seltzer After a couple of failed attempts to brew a seltzer, probably a nutrient deficiency that caused the batches to stall fermentation, I ended up with this tried and true hard seltzer cocktail recipe inspired by Brulosophy. I’ve now made about 10 batches, and each one has been pretty damn good, especially the watermelon batch. 

Recipe:  
2,625 mL of Vodka (exactly 1.5 handles of vodka)  
2 - 4oz fruit flavoring (check with your preferred LHBS for flavoring options)  
500 gm Sugar  
50 gm Malic Acid  
Top keg off with RO or distilled water  

Notes:  
Ensure to blend well. I add the Flavoring, Malic Acid, Sugar, and filled the keg half way with water. I then stirred with a drill-attached mixer from NorCal Brewing Solutions. Mix well enough to dissolve sugar and acid. Add vodka, top off with water, blend for just a bit more to homogenize what is pretty much a cocktail in a keg. ABV is about 5.6%.  

Feel free to adjust sugar and acid levels to your liking. These measurements are perfect for my liking, and those that have had the honor to try my hard seltzer.  

Super easy, super cheap, and a good beer alternative, though beer still reigns supreme.

What is a brewer to do when not making beer?,"What is a brewer to do when not making beer? Here's a funny little question that's probably borderline off topic - hope the sub doesn't mind.

I love homebrewing. Like a lot. Every single time I finish brewing a beer I clean up and put everything away while thinking to myself: *""Aw, we're done already?"".* I love the process - sitting outside, enjoying the weather even if it's bad, BBQing up some hamburgers or hotdogs while the mash is doing it's thing, all while drinking the homebrew I made a month or so ago. My local homebrew supply store even knows me by name I'm in there so much.

I try to keep myself from brewing more than once a week - any more than that and I just have too much beer. I know I can do smaller batches, or give more of my beer away. But I'm beginning to wonder what other things I can be doing during the week that will satisfy my itch to brew - or is it just a craving to create?

I recently saw a few videos by people who have their own pizza ovens. They made their own dough, rolled out their own pizzas and covered them with homemade sauces and ingredients. I realized that pizza making would probably be a fun thing for a brewer to try - it would be something I could iterate and experiment on through new techniques and ingredients - just like homebrewing.

**I would love to hear what hobbies other homebrewers are into and enjoy doing while not brewing?** I personally enjoy making jerkies in my food dehydrator and am seriously thinking about giving pizza making a try. What about you?",Homebrewing

Dual Body Regulator to Secondary Bank,"Dual Body Regulator to Secondary Bank Hey homebrewers. I am new to kegging and I was able to get my hands on 2 different CO2 regulators. A single body dual guage and a dual body regulator. I have been using the single body regulator, and would like to use the dual body one, however it is too heavy for my 5lb CO2 tanks. I was wondering if it is plausible to convert the dual body to a 2 way secondary setup by throwing a plug where the high pressure guage is and swapping the tank connector for a 5/16 hose barb, then mounting that inside my kegerator. Would this work, or is there some fundamental difference between how a primary and secondary regulator is made?

My input was that CO2 build up causes carbonation and could make a bottle bomb but doesn't kill the yeast. Alcohol past it's tolerance, heat, or potassium/sodium metabisulfite will kill it. Even if all the sugars are fermented out to dry most of the yeast falls out but there is enough (maybe dormant idk) that if you add sugar it will kick back up (such as to prime a beer for carbonation).

So last week I was able to get a Large 50 Litre Keg from a local bar. I called them and they gave it up for free because it belonged to the previous owner who left it out back.

I’d like to empty the keg for personal use (strongman training) but I’m not sure how to go about that. Some youtube videos suggest that I just need to jam a screwdriver and push the ball down to depressurize. But the videos only seemed to talk about kegs that are mostly empty. I’ve also heard that kegs can explode if overpressurized so I’m also concerned about emptying a full keg that has been left out for a long time.

2) Wallpaper steamers aren't exactly made for food production, and the hoses and other parts contain some plastic.  If the machinery ***is*** safe to use with alcohol as a 'seasoner', is leaching (from the plastic) a concern

3) If it is safe to do this with the machine, but leaching ***is*** a concern, is there a 'safe' concentration to do this at (ie, 1 ml distilled water for each 1ml  80 proof alcohol )?",Homebrewing

How Long Should My 2.5lb CO2 Tank Last?,"How Long Should My 2.5lb CO2 Tank Last? Hello fellow homebrewers,

I have been brewing hard cider for just about a year now. I carbonate all my cider and have a kegerator setup. It has been going well, and I have really been enjoying this new hobby. That being said, lately I feel my CO2 has been running out extremely fast. In the past, I could get 3-4 corny kegs carbonated, then dispensed from my kegerator with a single 2.5lb CO2 tank. Now I am having to refill my CO2 every 1.5-2 kegs.

To get into specifics, I generally will force carbonate my corny keg at 23 PSI for about 3 days. Then I lower the pressure to 8 PSI for serving. I checked my keg and CO2 regulator for leaks and found none. Is it possible CO2 is seeping out through my liquid line? I am under the impression that would make cider come out of the tap if that’s the case.

Just wondering if anyone else has had much experience with this and if I should really need to be exchanging my CO2 tank as often as I am? Might be time to upgrade to a 5lb tank for carbonating and use my 2.5lb for serving from the kegerator.

Any information would be greatly appreciated!",Homebrewing

This also happened when I did an initial test of the keg by pouring in a bunch of hard and pressurizing at ~10 PSI, so I don't think it's my beer.

I thought this might be due to adding too much pressure, but even if I almost totally depressurize and let the beer sit for a few hours, I get the same effect when the beer comes out slowly.  This is really disappointing because I'm wasting a bunch of beer and I feel like I can't enjoy it.

I bought [this filter](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B00CH29IK2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for a closed transfer.

Throughout all of this, beer is coming out, so I'm catching it in cups to just not make a mess. Finally, it's out of the carboy. I figured I lost about 1.25 gallons. I drank a few of the cups just to get something out of it.

Proceeded to force carbing, no issues there. The next day, I go to pull a pint off and nothing comes out, so I disassemble the faucet and it's got hop matter all stuck through it.

I'm also giving away 1 can of their Sacred Saison home brew extract which I already have some on tap on my keezer and it is really good. the 3rd and final prize will be a 4-piece set of Belgian stemware glasses. I already posted the video which has the link but will post both the link to that on Reddit and the direct link to the contest in the comments below. My goal here is to simply give away some cool stuff while helping Brewferm to get their name out there as a thank you for hooking up fellow brewers.

Saison with slow/low bottle carbonation.,"Saison with slow/low bottle carbonation. I bottled a saison (wlp 565, dupont clone) October 27th and am experiencing low/incomplete carbonation with most of my bottles. I used two cooper carb drops per 650ml bottle. What really confuses me is that one of the bottles from 5 days ago had a nice rocky perfect head, but any bottles opened since have had barely any head and low carbonation. Any tips? Should I just use dextrose next time or just wait even longer? The bottles have been conditioning at room temperature.",Homebrewing
Soaking oak chips in Sherry for “barrel aging”?,"Soaking oak chips in Sherry for “barrel aging”? Hello,

So I have been researching a bit and cannot find a definitive answer but I am between brewing an Imperial Stout or possible an English style Old Ale along with a friend. We have always talked about barrel aging and actually have a source for a couple ex bourbon barrels. However, I wanted to explore the realm of Sherry casks but found them to be much more expensive. Would it be possible to replicate them, if only slightly, to soak oak chips or spirals in a good mid range Sherry? The beer would be aged in a climate controlled area for a number of months to possibly a year or so.",Homebrewing

Life span of fermenting buckets?,"Life span of fermenting buckets? Been brewing now for the past three years and I am currently in the process of switching to brewing in 6 gallon corney kegs. Never the less over the past 3 years I have used the same buckets and think there is a lifespan for plastic buckets.

Yesterday I went and cracked open the lid of a heavily hopped ipa to and in some dry hops and noticed that it was infected. I have brewed roughly 30 batches in this bucket in particular and this is the first issue. This got me to thinking that possibly over the course of the last 3 years with cleaning them and storing them enough micro scratches have built up that makes it less and less likely they will end up sterile for subsequent batches.

Help me do a post mortem,"Help me do a post mortem I've just dumped my second batch of 19l of beer after failing for the second time with the same exact recipe (English ale). It's a very simple recipe:

Bottling yeast experiment result,"Bottling yeast experiment result A while ago I posted here about a tripel karmeliet i was brewing and wheter or not the yeast from fermentation would be able to bottle condition or if I needed to add a bottling yeast. (https://old.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/jd0dse/i_should_repitch_yeast_for_bottling_right/) 

This is a pretty anecdotal experiment so do consider it as such.

What I ended up doing is splitting the batch, adding a tiny bit of cbc-1 to half the batch.
It's now been 4 weeks (also tasted both at 3 weeks) and the results have left me with more questions that before.

for priming sugar, I used candi syrup diluted in water (aiming for 3 volumes of C02)

the bottom line is both batches carbonated just fine, the added yeast was not needed:
- at 3 weeks the cbc-1 batch had great carbonation, whereas the other one wasn't quite there
- at 4 weeks it's hard to tell the difference with regards to carbonation

now here's the part I don't quite understand :
- the batch that did NOT receive cbc-1 has more yeast deposits in the bottles
- the batch that did NOT receive cbc-1 is very slightly sweeter (enough that I can consistently detect it in a blind test)

I'm guessing that could be explained by the different yeast behavior. it's also possible that I didn't have a consistent product between the two batches, as i transfered the cbc-1 batch from the fermenter first, so I guess it could have had more stuff towards the bottom.

Also for a futur batch, I'd aim for a lower carbonation, there's a lot of yeast in these bottles and the high carbonation tends to swoosh things around making it less pleasant.",Homebrewing

"Relatively new to brewing, question about liquid yeast starter vs dry yeast","Relatively new to brewing, question about liquid yeast starter vs dry yeast I am a relatively new homebrewer, have done 4 batches in total strictly following recipes from kits. I've been using liquid yeast but was not making a starter since the recipe didn't call for it. When I started to read about it, it definitely seems like I have probably been underpitching for some of the batches because of it so I ordered a stir plate, flask, DME... all the fixings to do a starter in the future.

But from what I can tell, newer brands of dry yeast like Fermentis are just as effective without the need for a starter or even necessarily to be rehydrated, and for higher gravity brews you can just add a second pack.

My question is, other than personal preference and availability of different yeast strains, is there any real difference between using liquid yeast with a starter to increase cell count compared to using dry yeast and adding an extra packet to increase cell count?",Homebrewing

Fast forward half an hour and while cleaning up it dawns on me that my freshly made wort with pitched yeast is sitting in a fermenter that was rinsed with 2 litres of water mixed with half a cap of lactic acid.

I quickly transferred it into a properly cleaned and sanitised fermenter and put the lactic in an out of the way place in the shed far away from the sanitiser.

Is my beer going to be OK? Will it be safe? Will it turn out sour?

All my fermenter are plastic. 

Thanks in advance brewers!!",Homebrewing

1. I spilled about a half cup of the malt syrup (on the floor, ugh), will this affect the brewing process?
2. I left the wort to cool in the sink with ice and water, and didn't realize our sink doesn't exactly hold water well and it was sitting without ice water for about 10 min before I realized. I filled it back up with water but ended up trying to cool it for about 30 extra minutes. The lid was on the pot for most of the time except when I was checking it. Should this affect it either?
3. My instructions didn't say anything about checking the temp or abv or anything at any point. When are the key times to take any sort of measurements?

testing store-bought juice for preservatives before starting a big batch of wine,"testing store-bought juice for preservatives before starting a big batch of wine There are four kinds of juice in my local supermarket (in Istanbul) and they all list no preservatives. Experience has taught me that they might, in fact, have unlisted preservatives in them which will prevent fermentation. 

I plan to pitch yeast in sugar-water with some energizer (I don't trust my yeast, either) and then add it to four glasses of juice. If it bubbles, that would be the juice that I go with. 

Can I put the yeast into straight 100% juice, or should I dilute it to a particular specific gravity even just for a test? (Added complication: my hydrometer broke and the new one is going to take a few weeks to get here.) I'm guessing it needs a little extra sugar, as wine usually starts at 1.08 and the internet says that regular juice is around 1.05.

"I Need Advice For My ""All Up EÑO Beer"" Recipe.","I Need Advice For My ""All Up EÑO Beer"" Recipe. After making a few gallons of Meads and Beers. I decided that I wanted to *make one.* I had two all grains under my belt, and I felt like with my research and knowledge, I could make my own all-grain brew, from complete scratch. I was partially correct.

**My Goal** 

I set out with the idea that I was going to make a highly drinkable, jalapeno ale. Since really nobody else online was doing what I wanted to make,  I toyed with the process of adding peppers and spice to make the brew spicy enough to *tingle* (not burn) and feel like it was warming. A very fine line I know. 

**The Process**

I started with a 4 Cup batch. it was seriously weird but I wanted to make a super small batch before I made a gallon or two of it.  The yield was 2.5 cups of questionable albeit very good beer. my main issue with that small of a batch was dealing with the yeast cake, clarity, and headspace. That first batch was honestly pretty good and was too spicy with the addition of habanero peppers as well as jalapeno, but I needed to make that batch and I'm glad I did, I saw a lot of issues with the original recipe and made the necessary changes. The first things I attempted to correct were the lack of mouthfeel, clarity, head retention, and obviously lower the spice.

After that, I waited a few days and made a 2-gallon batch with the necessary adjustments. Due to the micro-batch that the first one was, I now had really abnormal measurements that needed to be converted, which worked out in the end so, sorry when you read the ingredients and wonder wtf I was thinking using cups instead of gallons, or Tbsp instead of cups. This batch went amazingly. The process was easy, smooth, and could not have been better, It clarified perfectly too as a perfect jalapeno color. I bottled and let carbonate for 3 weeks, and then tested the first bottle. 

**The Results that I need help with**

What I got was a mostly clear, beer with a 1-1.5 inch head that was completely gone within 30 seconds. A mouthfeel that was best described to be ""If Budlight had an anorexic cousin"" but ""great flavor and spice"". The spice was perfect. A warm tingle in the back of your throat and tongue, that never built past that. It aged amazingly and was at its best around the 3-month mark but I did leave them all in a fridge the entire time after their carbonation stage. But the biggest issues that need to be addressed are Head retention, Mouthfeel, and clarity. 

If you could please let me know what needs to be changed to fix these issues, and if you are able to try it out yourself, please do and let me know how it went. I'm going to list the ingredients below, I haven't toyed with using xanthan gum (I still don't think I want to) and I'd like to stay as close to the original as possible, the flavor was amazing, I just need to know what to do to fix these issues. I do use Irish sea moss as a clarifier. With this current configuration, I get an almost champagne effect with the carbonation after the head is completely gone.

**Ingredients List/Recipe**

2 Gallons Recipe for ""All Up EÑO Beer""

* 34.5 cups of purified water
* 1 Cup of Rice
* 4 Cups of oats
* 12 Cups of Light Caramel Malt
* 4 Tbsp of Ginger Powder
* 2 Tbsp of Fresh ginger
* 12 Tbsp of DME (Sparkling Amber)
* 1.5 Cups of Honey (Clove)
* 2 Large Jalapenos split in quarters (during the entire boil)
* 1 Cup of Brown Sugar 
* 1 Tbsp of Hallertau Hop Pellets
* Nottingham Ale Yeast

OG- 1.049

FG- 1.017

ABV \~4.3%

Mash at 154°F (68°C) for 60 minutes. Mash out at 168°F (76°C), Bring to a rolling boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at 35 minutes from the end of the boil. Chill wort to 86°F (30°C) and pitch yeast. Ferment in primary at 68°F (17°C) until an FG of 1.017 is achieved. Bottle with 7 Tbsp of White Granulated Sugar, dissolved thoroughly and age for at least 3 weeks.

Note: I cold crashed before bottling to better the clarity however, I was still left with a less than Opaque brew.

**Final Thoughts**

Thank you so much for any help or even just reading. I'm not highly experienced however use brewing as a decompression method and I really enjoy learning about the process. It's incredibly fascinating and I love the history and science behind it. Any help is appreciated, Thank you again, and have a great day!",Homebrewing
All grain noob question: mash thickness,"All grain noob question: mash thickness I have a question which seems pretty basic, but I can't find a good answer in my books or online. I'd appreciate it if someone can point me in the right direction!

What criteria determine your starting mash thickness? Most brewers seem to choose something like 1.25 or 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grist, but the choice seems almost arbitrary.

My assumption is that thickness of less than 1 qt/lb  would just be too thick to work with. I also understand the practical need to start with a thick mash if you're infusing for several rests. 

A ratio of 3 qt/lb is sometimes given as an upper limit, but I have no idea why.  Is it too thin to form a good grain bed? So much water in the first runnings that you won't be able to  include enough water in the sparging process?

Is there something that I'm missing? Some actual, noticeable effect on flavor or body? Why don't we always use, say, 1.25 qt/lb?

Thank you!",Homebrewing

Yeast CO2 Production,"Yeast CO2 Production This is going to sound stupid but is there a definite point where no further CO2 will be produced by the yeast and if so is this the ultimate indication of complete fermentation?

Reason I ask is, I have a ball valve on my blowoff tube. I got the idea of closing that for 4-5 hours after my SG was stable. Then I'll open it and see how much gas was generated. I don't have time to stare at the blowoff tube for a bubble that might only be generated once every 20 minutes. I'm assuming there will be a point where no more gas is generated and then I'll know fermentation is 100% complete but I need this thinking to be critiqued.",Homebrewing

Setup advice on first all grain brew,"Setup advice on first all grain brew I'm doing my first all grain brew and I just wanted to check that there aren't any hidden issues in my method. I'm trying to avoid buying any new equipment so I dug out an electric turkey fryer out of storage that basically works as a 7.5 gallon stovetop kettle with a heating stick. It has a spigot but no false bottom. I feel like this is too small for a 5 gallon BIAB so I was planning to basically do a traditional mash and lauter in this kettle using a paint strainer bag instead of a false bottom. I used brewfather to make the water volumes, I think I input the max volumes correctly.


For a detailed explanation:



1. Heat 4.4 gallons to strike temp in turkey fryer, add bag and grain and mash for 1 hour

1. Heat 2.7 gallons of sparge water

1. Drain wort into separate kettle

1. Batch sparge, drain

1. Remove grain bag and return wort to turkey fryer 

1. Boil, etc...


So my equipment limits my volume to max of 7.5 gallons at any step and I have to use the same container for mashing and boiling.

i could even overload it with pressure right before i go somewhere, just to ensure i'll still get to pour from it throughout the night.

i guess i shouldn't be surprised, i just thought at some point the pressure would be too small to push out maybe the last third or so of the keg. to my surprise it emptied the water entirely. pretty cool.

Rookie question about honey vs honey malt,"Rookie question about honey vs honey malt So I’m trying to make a beer close to Bell’s Hopslam and am not sure what to do to get a good honey flavor that balances well with the rest of the beer. I’ve read that adding honey even with around 5 minutes left in the boil won’t add much (if any) actual honey flavor to your beer. Instead what I’ve seen is the yeast will just convert the honey to alcohol and you lose most or all of the honey flavor. I’ve seen some recipes that add honey to the fermenter after fermentation is mostly completed. I’ve seen some that just use honey malt in the grain bill. What do you guys think would be the best way to get a honey flavor that’s noticeable, but balanced with the rest of the beer? I don’t want to make a sweet IPA, just an IPA that you can tell has a touch of honey. Bell’s actual Hopslam homebrew recipe just uses honey at the end of the boil, but I’ve seen quite a few people who made their own take on the recipe that use honey malt. Some use honey malt and honey. My planned grain bill using honey malt is as follows (btw let me know if anything looks off about this!):

***

10lbs 2 row

5lbs pale ale

.5lbs caramel 40

.5lbs honey malt

.5lbs carafoam

.35lbs acid malt

My only disappointment (which is understandable) is waiting for water to carbonate. I'm familiar with force carbing and shaking the kegs up to speed the process along, plus I will have the other keg already carbed up before I do the next one. However, I'm curious if you had any suggestions using a carbonator to take it to the next level.

My desire is to eventually upgrade to something where my carbonation is instant and I don't have to put forth as much effort.

I ferment this strain, as most people suggest, at 64 F to start and finish a little higher, 68-70 F. Yeast count at 0.75m/ml/P or thereabouts, O2 for a minute for low-med gravity, 2 min for higher gravity. That same process with WLP530 has landed me a gold medal for a tripel the only time I've entered one in a competition. I loved the results.

I’ve had a few stinkers – custom recipes that weren’t nearly as good as I’d hoped. 

But nothing major has gone wrong. No bottle bombs. No infections. Nothing that made me waste all the work involved in brewing 5 gallons of beer. 

That is... until today. 

My Christmas beer – a malty, higher-gravity saison – met an untimely end. 

It’s been a good while since I’ve kegged. For various reasons, I’ve just been bottling over the past year, year and a half. For some reason, the thought of cleaning a keg seemed more daunting than cleaning 50 bottles.

I had a Christmas beer that finished fermenting and a Christmas hard cider I was looking forward to enjoying over the next 34 or so days. 

Three days ago, I put the beer in the newly cleaned keg and lines. I hooked up the gas and gave it 35psi for 2 days to speed-carb it. 

Last night, I dropped down to 14psi, bled off the excess, and poured me a small glass full just to taste. Delicious! Everything I was shooting for. A couple of weeks of aging would do this batch a favor, but it’s still great as it is. 

Unbeknownst to me, my output connector that hooks into the keg had a crack in it. It must have been from the year+ of lack of use. 

I didn’t discover this until I came home this evening when I discovered...

I checked and double checked the seals, the airlock and everything seemed air tight. I’m also fairly confident that I sanitised properly. Could this be oxidisation? An infection? Or has the crystal malt just darkened it more than I expected it to?

I did adjust water chemistry the first time, and I got a decent mouthfeel w/ this brew. Would that involve increasing the flaked oat content in the grain bill?

Also, in terms of hops -- a few of my friends have said this is a very high amount of hops for a NEIPA (not sure I agree). It does have a slightly hoppy taste but I was under the impression you need these big dry hops to get that haziness in the beer. Curious if this can be toned down slightly?

Yeast starter tips (first time),"Yeast starter tips (first time) Hi all,

I am going to make a batch of California Common next week. Always fancied it since reading about it in Brewing Classic Styles. My LHBS has just by chance got in one packet of wyeast 2112 California Lager so I snapped it up along with the rest of the ingredients I needed. 

Looking at my wort gravity (1.055 for 24L) it looks like I am going to have to make a starter. I've never done this before and have a couple of questions! 

I'll make 2L of 1.040 wort with some nutrient, pitch the yeast and leave it in a 5L carboy for a few days, swirling it every few hours. Will temperature control it best I can (left out a tester and water gets to about 33 degrees left overnight in our kitchen).

Where I am confused...

I only do partial boils so I guess I will need to take into account the volume of the starter when diluting my wort? 

Do I need to take into account the alcohol the yeast has made? It'll be tiny right?

Freeze Distilling Cider,"Freeze Distilling Cider I have fermented a mix of organic kiwi apple and grape juice and want to freeze distill it.

I have heard many warnings with freeze distilling regarding methanol and other compounds usually removed at beginning of heated distillation, but to me they seem illogical. Surely everything is just concentrated and if there is no danger in drinking home brewed cider there is no danger in drinking its freeze distilled counterpart

Anyone had much experience with it?

Help with messed up brew,"Help with messed up brew My ale process was going perfect until priming, I had ended up reducing everything in my batch by 3 times (as I wanted to use this batch as a tasting batch instead).

The fresh was pasteurized and I used campden in it. Let it sit for 24 hours too. But now that batch, while it’s bubbling, smells very distinctly like sulfur. Doesn’t smell pleasant at all.

Does keg line oxidisation effect beer in keg?,"Does keg line oxidisation effect beer in keg? Hello,

I moved house for renos 3/4 months ago and turned off my kegerator as I wasn't going to be using it. I had a hoppy blonde in one keg and a milk stout in the other.

I've since returned and the beer in the lines seemed heavily oxidised, the blonde was pink after 3 months of sitting in the tube. I thought the keg was tapped as I was getting a lot of foaming before I turned off the kegerator and I assumed if there was anything left it would be heavily oxidised from 4 months of sitting in a warm garage. These assumptions were wrong. I opened the keg to clean for the next brew and there was still about a gallon left that looked and smelled fine. Im now drinking the milk stout and honestly, it tastes fine.

Anyone experience line oxidation making its way into the keg? Or did I waste a gallon of awesome beer? Bonus question, how long can you warm store beer under pressure?

Recalculating my gravity after adding more sugar?,"Recalculating my gravity after adding more sugar? Hello Team

I had some weird stuff happen to me recently with this last brew, so bear with me.

First off, this beer I'm doing is a nothing special brown ale - Had it taken off and done everything as expected the final gravity should have been around 5% - (Gravity reading I took was 1.040). I'm about 90% certain I added the liquid yeast to early to everything before sealing it up and potentially thought I had just killed it. So, I let a few days go by and checked the airlock and ... nothing. It wasn't going. I popped it open and it looked like SOME activity had happened, but not a lot. A mild, scummy looking ring around the top, but not much else. Definetly not what I'm used to seeing, especially at this point. SO, I decided to try again with an extra Ale yeast satchel I had. Before that, I mixed in a little sugar mixture (1.5 cups water (warmed) 1 cup sugar, 2 tbsp brown sugar) so this new yeast would have something additional to eat and also took a gravity reading.

So, my OG, prior to adding extra sugar, was 1.040
My current gravity is 1.020

my question is how do I calculate my gravity at this point? 
I'll obviously take a final gravity reading before bottling and all that, but I just want to see if there is some kind of formula I can use for my circumstance? Do I use the 2nd gravity reading? Do I do some kind of subtraction or division?

Any help would be greatly appreciated

Mash time's effect on attenuation?,"Mash time's effect on attenuation? So I've done a few brews on my Foundry now. Before I had been using a three tiered system, with 60 min mashes and never thought anything of it. But after looking at Beersmith's mash profiles it seems to recommend 90 minute mash's for lighter body beers, and the 75, then 60 as you increase the targeted body for the beer.

Does the mash time actually have a significant effect on the body and attenntuation if you're still hitting the mash temps for that style? For example, on a beer mashed at 156, will it end drier if mashed for 90 instead of 60 min?

Pump recommendations for moving hot sparge water from Grainfather heater,"Pump recommendations for moving hot sparge water from Grainfather heater I have a Grainfather and the Grainfather sparge water heater, which is basically just a coffee urn with a spigot at the bottom. I fill it from my RO drinking water tap at my kitchen sink, using a hose with the water heater on the ground. Then I lift it up to the counter, and from there lift it up on top of a sturdy stepstool that is on the counter. Then I plug it in and heat it up. When it’s time to sparge, I connect a hose to the spigot on the heater and use gravity to run sparge water into the grain basket. 

The problem with this setup is that I have worsening arthritis. It is not easy for me to lift 4 gallons of water up onto the stool on the counter. I also worry about the safety issue of having all of that hot water up where it could in theory get knocked over, though it is pretty sturdy.

What I would like is to be able to keep the water heater on the ground and use a pump to send the hot sparge water up to the grain basket. Self-priming ransfer pumps with racking arms don’t seem to be able to work with sparge temp water. A wort pump would be OK with the temps but the spigot is only 4 inches off the ground, so I’m not sure how well they would prime. Plus, there’s no way to firmly connect a hose to the spigot. Presently I just jam a silicone hose up on there are far as it will go. 

Currently I also use my Grainfather to clean my draft lines. I make up some BLC and use the pump in the Grainfather to move it through the lines, which works okay but is kind of clunky. It would be great to be able to do this with just a plastic bucket and a pump, rather than having to mess around with the whole Grainfather setup.

*****So not only being sneaky I need to figure out the ratio for all of this is in a 64oz juice jug *****
I am hoping some smart people out there can help me. I am pretty smart just not about this...haha. 

So I have used a whole pack of red star yeast in a 100 percent juice bottle. I pour some out to make room for foam etc. Then I add some dissolved sugar about one cup. At first just left it open and waited at least 3 days for that. It did work but yes I am impatient. 
I bought some air locks and idk they don't seem to prove helpful.
I do get buzzed etc


Now I started using alco-tec. They recommend a 5 gallon bucket for brewing. I cannot do that. I need a ratio for a normal juice bottle... 
How much alco- tec to add and sugar. I store the bottle inside a open shopping bag to catch any over flow and wait even 24 hour with the Alco-tec 48hr. I store it in the basement which is dark. 
Anyway, I get a decent tasting bubbly drink. It does get me buzzed. 

My boyfriend doesn't want me drinking and is home all the time do to covid so I cannot even just buy alcohol. UGH...

If I attach the ""secondary"" to the ""primary"" with a RHT to LHT nipple, is that essentially the same thing as building a primary? Can it safely handle the pressure coming out of the cylinder, or does it actually need a first stage regulator to be safe?

Another question: taprite sells a different regular, 5740, which is targeted at soda. How is that different from the other regulators?

inb4 you ask why not just mount the secondary: aesthetics. There's no great place to mount the secondary in my keezer and have it look good, and after the amount of money I've sunk into this thing I want it to look right.",Homebrewing

Bottle conditioning a lager - Saving part of liquid yeast. I have ??,"Bottle conditioning a lager - Saving part of liquid yeast. I have ??  I am brewing a Mexican/Vienna lager, partial extract. The recipe I have calls for 2 packs of WLP940 Mexican Lager Yeast initially. After 2 weeks of primary fermentation and 4 weeks of secondary fermentation, it calls for 1/4 of a pack of the yeast for bottle carbing. I'd rather not buy another pack of yeast for this.  


1. Do I even need more yeast to carbonate the beer?  I never have before.    
2. If so, can I just save some of the liquid yeast and use it when I bottle the beer?  
3. Would you even do a secondary? I've rarely done it but understand it might be needed when the beer sits for a long time on the trub.

First brew recipe with limited ingredients! Help ?,"First brew recipe with limited ingredients! Help ? 
Hello Homebrewers! 

So lets get straight to the point! I live in a place where i have limited (not even) access to everything from equipment to grains, yeast, hops...  I have read alot about homebrewing but i guess nothing helps like doing it and learning. 

With what i got access to currently, i’m prepping to brew my first beer this week after thinking of doing so for quiet a while now. So i gathered what i could find to fit the profile of a good American IPA (if you can call it that) and here is what i’m thinking of for my recipe: 

Grains: 
- 3kg pilsner malt 
- 1 kg victory malt 
- 1 kg aroma malt

Yeast:
- Safale s-04

Hops:
-cascade whole leaf hops
-citra pellets

Process:

-Mashing all grains with (how much water?) for an hour 
-Strain grains
-Sparge ? 
-Adding 25grams cascade hops after turning off flame
-boil wort for 45 mins 
-add 14 grams citra &amp; 14 grams cascade 
-boil for 10 mins 
-add 20 grams cascade 
-boil for 4 mins
-add 10 grams citra &amp; 10 grams cascade 
-boil for 1 min
-cool down (ice bath) 
-move to fermenter 
-pitch yeast (how much?) 
-ferment for 2 weeks
-dry hop after 1st week ? 

My main concerns are the amount of victory and aroma malt used and how much water to start with and how if not total amount fits a 5 gallons batch. 

Thanks for whoever can help me avoid a disaster! Cheers!",Homebrewing
Milk Stout Off Flavour x 3,"Milk Stout Off Flavour x 3 Hello all. This is driving me a crazy. My stouts and other darker beers used to be the only thing that turned out before I got into water chemistry and fine-tuned some of my other processes. For some reason, I keep getting a rubbery-like aroma in my milk stouts. The taste is a little alcoholic as well but this was just a sample. This is the third time I've tried brewing a milk stout and I get this aroma and flavour. 

A little bit of history.. My ""light"" beers like cream ales never turned out well, until I started using lactic acid for ph and campden tablets to remove the chlorine. I started pressure fermenting recently (maybe 6 batches in) and I love it! Had ambers and IPAs and cream ales all turn out, but the first milk stout turned out like my batches before adjusting my water and pressure fermenting.

Some thought the come to mind:

1. Maybe the lactose is messing things up, but i thought it would be pretty straightforward to use. I used 1/2 lb at the end of the boil of a 5g batch. Maybe I am missing something? Should I use lactose at a different time?

2. Ph too low? Maybe all of the roasted malts are lowering the ph of my mash too much? I don't feel like this is the off flavour they would contribute too. I don't take a ph reading either, but probably should

3. Maybe I forgot to use campden tablets for the sparge water? I know I used it for the mash water.

4. Maybe a bit of an underpitch. I used wlp002 and made a 2L starter but saved some for a future brew. Didn't seem very actice, but pitched it anyway

Any ideas are appreciated!

Bottle bombs and how to stop them.,"Bottle bombs and how to stop them. \[copied from r/BrewingNewbies\]

First off, what is a bottle bomb? Well, to keep it short, it's when the co2 levels are too high for the container to handle, and in turn, it explodes.

Now how do we stop our bottles from turning into a war missile? It's actually pretty simple (which means it pretty overlooked).

**1) Your yeast is not done!!!**

If you have any amount of sugar in the container your storing your brew and there's yeast still left alive, then it's going to eat the leftover sugar and continue to make alcohol and also co2 (that's the stuff that makes your bottles go boom 💥).

**2) Basic thermodynamics**

Co2 and everything else in the universe obeys the laws of physics. As the temperature rises so does pressure, making it even more important to not keep your brews in a hot place.

**3) Your airlock is fucked man**

Enough said. If you don't have or can't get an airlock your probably WAY too young to be even brewing in the first place.

**4)** **Contamination**

Wild yeast and bacteria eat and ferment certain sugars that brewers yeast can't. If your brew does become contaminated then it can lead to over-carbonation.

**5) USE. THE RIGHT. BOTTLES.**

If you're using just a plain regular glass bottle to store your co2... It's going to blow up. You MUST use beer or champagne bottles if you are looking to keep some of that sweet sweet carbonation.

I hope this helped clear up some confusion or explained some things more.",Homebrewing

2.5 Gallon Setup Questions,"2.5 Gallon Setup Questions Hi All,


My dad gave me all of his brewing equipment from 20+ years ago, brewed my first batch with an extract kit and made drinkable beer. I really enjoyed the brewing process and it was cool to make drinkable beer, even after a few mishaps. I'm not looking to upgrade piecemeal so much as build a new setup.

Anyway, I want to do all grain and 2.5 gallon batches, this has led to me to the Anvil Foundry 6.5 (with pump kit). I really like the idea of the e-BIAB option both for space savings and because my gf asked that I not brew in the kitchen :)  So, a couple of questions:

1. I'm looking at the Anvil 4g bucket fermenter, is this a good option? I also see that people ferment in kegs, is this viable or preferred for 2.5 gallon batches? 

2. I hated bottling and want to keg. I'm seeing 2.5g and 3g kegs, should I go with 2.5g or do I need extra space like I would in a fermenter? 

3. I'd prefer not to buy a mini-fridge at this point as I'm in a rental house that has two full size refrigerators. We don't have anything in the spare fridge other than beer anyway, can I just put the kegs and CO2 tank in the fridge and serve from there with a picnic tap? 

4. I really like sours and will brew my own. I've read mixed things about kettle souring and sharing equipment with non-sour beers. Is it safe to use the same kettle for both? I would probably dedicate one keg and one fermenter to sours as I'll likely always have one on hand.

Question about adding malt late in the boil,"Question about adding malt late in the boil Sunday I brewed an imperial stout. I was doing a partial boil with an extract kit. I encountered a few issues and I’m wondering if I should have done anything differently.

The recipe called for adding 6 lbs LME and 2 lbs of DME with 10 minutes left in the boil. I’ve never done a recipe that called for adding malt that late. Adding this much cool malt stopped the boil for about five minutes while the pot got back up to temp. As it returned to a boil the pot came close to boiling over and I had to remove it from the burner a few times before the foam settled. My timer went off while I was still working on getting the hot break to settle. I didn’t want to start cooling the wort while the hot break was still going on so I left it on the burner until it settled. I think it was about 10 minutes. After I cooled it in an ice bath I noticed a lot more stuff floating in the wort than usual. I wasn't sure if it was proteins or scorched malt from adding it too fast or bits of grain that got out of the grain bag. I decided to pour the chilled wort through a grain bag into the fermenter to filter out the solids. I'm not sure how all this is going to affect the beer. Any feedback would be appreciated.

What was the point of adding the malt so late in the boil?

Is the extra time on the burner going to be noticeable? I I figured some extra bitterness from boiling the hops longer wouldn’t be too noticeable in such a big beer.

How is filtering the solids out before fermenting going to affect the beer?",Homebrewing
Why does wine turn into vinegar? (Answer),"Why does wine turn into vinegar? (Answer) [copied from r/BrewingNewbies]

Most people know that vinegar is made from wine, but what makes wine into vinegar in the first place? Well, there are two answers, a long one, and a short one. The short answer is adding additional oxygen after the first week. The long answer is because of a bacteria called Acetobacter. It produces something called acetic acid, it basically makes vinegar, vinegar. Acetobacter uses alcohol and oxygen to produce acetic acid. That's why it's important to not put in any oxygen after the first week, maybe even sooner.
Now how can you prevent that? Well, you can use chemicals like Campden Tablets, Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite. But if you're like me and don't want to use added chemicals then there are a few steps you can take to make sure Acetobacter doesn't have the time or resources to turn your wine into vinegar. First fermenting, as I said above you should never add in more oxygen after the first week, you can keep it out by using an airlock, or by using a siphoning tube when racking or bottling. Second, you can sanitize everything before use. Yes, Acetobacter is on anything and everything but sanitizing will make it so there isn't as much of it when you're brewing. Lastly, you can pasteurize OR cold crash your brew when it's done fermenting (note: this only works if the Acetobacter hasn't already turned your wine into vinegar) this will help kill anything left alive if you're planning on leaving it in long turn storage.
I hope this helped clear up some confusion because I know some people want to hear details and explanations and not just ""don't put in oxygen"".",Homebrewing

Recipe for 5.5 Gallons

10 lbs Pale Malt

1 lb Crystal 15

.5 oz Columbus (16.2%) 60 minutes

.5 oz Columbus (16.2%) 5 minutes

1 oz Columbus whirlpool

US-05 American Ale yeast

I used RO water and mashed in with 5 gallons. I adjusted with 10g of gypsum, 1.5 g Calcium Chloride, and 2.5 g baking soda.  I did not adjust the sparge water since I batch sparge, although I might start doing this as an experiment.

Measured OG was 1.047 and I put 6 gal into the fermenter because I ended up with not as much evaporation as I expected.  I used [this hop spider](https://www.morebeer.com/products/hop-spider.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaVbo-Ui5m9228mVQma97erRMqrR4rgYsSNFU3byEecR0F3i-nRqiJMaAm3KEALw_wcB) from Morebeer for the hop additions, and a nylon mesh bag for the whirlpool.  According to Beersmith it should be 45 IBUs, but the sample I took did not seem to be super hoppy so maybe the hop spider had some negative effect on the hop utilization.  

I'll need to make a call on dry hopping tomorrow I guess.  I ferment in a Speidel so no pressure transfer for me, but I normally put it into a CO2 purged keg by draining it through the ""Out"" post of the keg.  I might try some sodium metabisulfite to further prevent oxidation.

I've also been locked into apartment brewing since the beginning and still am, which provides its own set of challenges.

My current set up is as follows: Igloo beverage cooler mash tun (batch sparge), regular ol' brewing pot that I boil on a stove, kitchen sink ice baths, two buckets pouring back and forth to aerate, Speidel fermenter that I have rigged for closed transfers (no true temp control), makeshift keezer with two 2.5 gallon kegs and picnic taps.

Brew days take me a long time and they have slowly become more of a chore vs enjoyable.  Anyway, point of this:  I'm looking for some insight into system upgrades that will streamline my process and bring me back to brewing?  I'd like to decrease my overall equipment so there's less to clean.

To upgrade or to overhaul,"To upgrade or to overhaul Here's my current rig: 10 gallon SS BrewTech kettle, the brew bag, 1800w induction burner, hotrod heatstick for extra power during boil, Jaded mantis chiller, Brewjacket immersion. 

I do 3.5-5 gallon BIAB batches. I live in 700 square foot New York apartment with an 11 month old taking up increasing space and attention, so efficiency in all aspects of my brewery is key. What I am trying to decide is whether to add pieces to my current system, or get a completely different system. Here's how I see those options right now:

**UPGRADE CURRENT SYSTEM**

My first thought is to add some kind of grain basket that can hang on top of the kettle when draining. I'm getting tired of having to hold the bag while it drains, and a ratchet to hold the bag isn't an option for me because of brewing location. 

Also considering adding a pump. Mash recirculation would be nice, but main benefits for me would be decreasing chilling times and the ability to do a real whirlpool so I'm not getting as much trub in the fermenter (I know this has no impact on beer quality, but I just want less in so I get more finished beer at the end lol). Would also like to be able to pump the wort into the fermenter instead of needing to use gravity (this would let me change where in the apartment I brew). 

Would also add something like the blichmann brewvision thermometer so I could monitor strike and mash temp on my phone and not need to check the kettle so often before the boil.

Any other thoughts on upgrades I could do to make things easier?

**JUST BUY A NEW SYSTEM**

The obvious choices here are either the Grainfather or Robobrew. Either one would essentially take all the different components I already have or would add in the upgrade scenario, but shrink the amount of space required to store them all. The Grainfather's bluetooth capabilities would be a huge plus for me. Step mashing would also be awesome since I don't do this right now for fear of scorching the bag. An all in one system would let me automate a lot of parts of the brewday that I can't automate right now - this is probably the biggest selling point for me since the kid has made brewdays trickier to pull of with my current set up.

**DRAWBACKS**

The upgrades would add more stuff for me to store, and space for my gear is already at a premium. 

My biggest concerns about the all in one systems are that there is a lot more stuff to break, and that if something breaks, the whole system could become unusable. Right now if one of my components breaks, I can just replace it and still use all the other equipment.

Any experience with home-canning?,"Any experience with home-canning? My father loves to homebrew. I help him when I’m able, but he’s not been able to go through his beer quickly enough to make new batches at the rate he wants to. A big part of this is due to covid and not being able to have guests over to drink it. For Christmas I wanted to get him a growler machine or a can seamer so he can can his own homebrew. This way he can give out his homebrew to friends and family to enjoy and continue making new batches. 

I know I know, we have plenty of growlers, but of course he doesn’t want to give out the nice ones if he doesn’t know he’ll get them back, and the cheap twist-cap ones don’t keep the beer fresh nearly as long.

My first batch ever is on it's way!,"My first batch ever is on it's way! Finally after lots of lurking in this sub and asking for advice I started my first batch ever.

It was supposed to become an all grain Pilsen but after the first struggles of an surprisingly big cooking pot and a ""not so perfect instruction"" it will be probably more like a chaos speedy strong.

It is based on a 100% Pilsen malt with a 6.5% bitter hops.

In the beginning i was very much struggling with the pot size that was easily 3 times the size of the biggest heating field my kitchen had to offer.

Instead of the expected resting temperatures every rest started out too hot before the temperature cooles down and I started the timer. Every Single rest was about 10 degrees higher than expected except for the last one when i finly managed to understand when to stop the heat and anticipate how much it continues to rise the temperature after.

I succeded the iodine test and was happy. I had the expected  wort strength in my mash and was ready to remove the grain. So far so good but that is where the plan completely disappeared.

I started out with 16 L of mash, recipe said i should add additional 12 L. But I did only 5 as my wort got incredibly watery and dropped down to 6° Plato instead of the 11,5 needed.

What to do I thought to myself. I don't want a weak watery beer. So I started to boil the hell out of the wort to get the percentage up again before adding the hops. I got back on track but way less wort than needed. After a reduced hops time (i only had about 2/3 to half of the quantity i should have for the 41gramm of Pellets) the wort was back up sky rocketing to 17° Plato...

At this point i wasnt happy, i was tired from already 8 hours of cooking. I was disappointed by the momentary Situation and in an mood that I just wanted to finish. To the at this point only 12 L i threw in the remaining of my yeast. If it is already stronger than usual i thought by myself that it can also accept almost double the yeast.

I filled it all into the plastic fermenter and to my even bigger disappointment it was leaking. I didn't saw a crack so It hat to be the valve. I checked it and started to juggle my future beer from one freshly sanitized pot to another to find out if the leak got less until I realised that whoever put the valve on the pot put the seal on the wrong side. I started to get angry that this small problem caused me additional loss of time. At this point i was only 5 hours away from waking up to my next work day but I changed it, sanitized everything again aaaand the bucket was still leaking. Much less but still enough... I couldn't take it any longer. I put the fermenter into the tub and could ignore the leak for the night. I needed some sleep.

Next day the leak was magically closed. The bubbler bubbeled fabolous and my hope was high again. Only 3 days later (today) there are only 6°Plato left. Supposedly it should take 2 weeks if I believe the recipe to be left with only 1/3 of the original strength.

First taste test is already promising. It's flavour full, a bit un harmonic still but not too bitter and I like the taste of the hops. Maybe tomorrow or the day after I plan to fill it up into bottles for the last carbonisation. (it already has some, but I want more)

Thanks for reading about my Chaos speedy strong Pilsener

Until now the foam that forms when pouring into the measuring cylinder falls down within a second. But maybe that will get better if the carbonisation is stronger.

For me it is almost certain that this wasn't the last time brewing.",Homebrewing

I'm personally leaning towards the post fermentation approach, because I'm afraid that the blueberry notes are going to change dramatically during fermentation.

How would you describe the ester flavors of A62 Bell's House Yeast?,"How would you describe the ester flavors of A62 Bell's House Yeast? Bell's mentions that you can ferment their house yeast warm and let the esters open up a bit but they only say it has a 'nice ester profile', which isn't very descriptive.  I personally have a tough time as well putting a finger on it based on a few batches with hop forward beers.  Had a BJCP certified buddy taste a Centennial Blonde with A62 he got some pepper and earthy ester notes but may have been more hop driven.  Any other thoughts?  Bell's beer is not available in Canada so it's kinda tough to compare to the commercial versions.  In any case, I'm glad I had a chance to get a yeast sample as any homebrew'd beer with A62 turns out great.

It luckily went on sale right when I decided to purchase it, so yay. Anyway, for those of you thinking about getting it, I wanted to put it a little report (and another one when I get a second keg).

The first thing I did was take out all of the shelves whatnot. One keg fits fine without any further messing around, but I want 2, so I proceeded to remove the plastic molding on the inside of the door to get more space. Unfortunately, it was all glued on, so I pulled off the gasket around the door (which just fits into a grove that goes around the edge of the door) and started to pry off the plastic. It wasn't too hard, but it wasn't a very clean job. the plastic was thin, so I ended up pulling it off in pieces until it was all off (it's verymuch like the annoying plastic packaging that lots of stuff comes in that is always obnoxious to open). I broke off the protrusions in the insulation afterwards so the inside of the door was flat. The gasket now doesn't fit well since the groove it fits in was part of the plastic I ripped off, but some glue or double-sided tape should be enough to put it back on. I'm going to drill a hole in the door and mount a faucet there. There is plenty of room above the kegs for disconnects, tubing, etc... and thermostat is high enough it won't need to be removed to make room for 2 kegs. 

I can't say for certain if 2 kegs would fit since I only have one, but I did trace my keg and cut a cardboard circle out to get an idea. It looks like it would *barely* fit 2 after the alterations I made. I'm going to get another keg and chance it. I'll use the second keg regardless of if they both fit or not.

I'll check back in when I get a 2nd keg and can confirm they both fit.",Homebrewing
Can I brew cooking wine from a kit?,"Can I brew cooking wine from a kit? Hi /r/ homebrewing!

I've been brewing beer for a little over five years. I take the process very seriously, spending time on perfecting recipes, using proper equipment and sanitizing. Throughout that time I've also used cider kits to make something else than beer every now and then. And while the results are less than perfect, some of the cider kits have turned out plenty drinkable and have been a hit at severals parties.

One thing I have never considered trying to brew is wine, as I don't think the results will be very good. I've seen my local brewing store sells kits for wine alongside the cider kits, but I am skeptical. However, I live in Europe and my country has very strict alocohol laws, meaning wine is very expensive. As such, there is no such thing as buying ""cheap cooking wine"", as even the worst quality wine you can find will have the same alcohol fees as an expensive wine (the alcohol fee is flat per ABV). There also is no such thing as cooking wine with salt added as I have heard countries like the US has. The cheapest bottles I can find are around $12 at the moment, and if I want something I can also enjoy a glass of I will need to pay at least $15. This effectively means cooking dishes with some wine in them, like pasta bolognese, or onion soup, are some of the more expensive dishes I make - which I find a bit silly.

Then it dawned on me, why don't I just brew some cheap wine from Red Wine Kit? The quality probably won't be great, but it should be decent enough for cooking. I figure one batch should last me at least a year or two if I only use it for cooking as well. From my understanding, one of the more important things about cooking wine is that it should be as dry as possible - and according to the wine kits I've seen in the store, they end below 1.000FG unless you specifically kill the yeast before it finishes. So if I just let the yeast finish out, the results should be really dry and hopefully tasty enough.

Now. I am posting here for general tips and a few specific questions. Does anyone here have experience with using such ""cheap"" red wine kits? How are the results? Any tips for adjusting the process if the end goal is cooking wine? Any tips for what grape to go for? I doubt mye home brewing store has great selection, but I saw they had a Rioja one - and I usually enjoy Rioja when talking about proper wines.

My main question is about bottling. I don't have wine bottles and would prefer not to buy any new gear for this experiment. Would bottling wine on longnecks work with normal caps? Wine bottles usually have corks, which breathe. However, screw tops, which seem to be getting more common on wine bottles, don't breate I believe. I would guess a long neck with a normal crown cap would work just fine. I have some 0.33L bottles standing around, and that amount would also be quite perfect for cooking I believe, as I usually use a little over third of a normal wine bottle.",Homebrewing

"Acetaldehyde, infection, or PH?","Acetaldehyde, infection, or PH? My dad and I recently tried making our first braggot. It was kind of a ""what do we have in the cupboards"" type moment so the recipe isn't perfect. We tried to go for a stout-like profile

Heres the recipe:
1. Safale us-05 
2. 1 lb Chocolate malt
3. 5 lb Honey
4. 1 lb flaked oats
5. 3.3. lb Liquid Malt Extract (Dark)
6. 1.5 oz cacao nibs

The grains were steeped in 2 gal of water at 156° F for 30 minutes, then the Liquid malt extract was added and boiled, at 60 minutes 0.5 oz of cacao nibs were added. 

The honey was dissolved in 3 gal of distilled room temperature water. Then the cooled wort was added to the must. To bring the whole thing up to 5 gals. 

Before pitching the yeast this tasted amazing, and felt very promising! Low acidity, very malty and a great mouth feel. 

Fermenation was very active and formed a very nice krausen. The braggot was left to ferment for roughly 2 weeks then my dad got impatient and racked it into a carboy. It sat in the carboy, reformed a new krausen and continued with a healthy fermentation for another 2 weeks. 

There were no off smells, or pellicles at any point of the fermentation.

We just got done racking into a corny keg, and took a small sample. It was incredibly tart, almost fruity in my opinion. Kind of similar to over-boiled / scorched coffee. 

Any ideas of what went wrong? And what are some possible solutions? Could it be acetaldehyde?

In theory, it seems like a better solution to cramming a floating tube onto a short liquid diptube.  At least:

* easier to swap between regular and floating tubes (I don't disassemble kegs often)
* I need only one per keg in service, instead of committing the diptube to the whole fermentation-and-service cycle (assuming I'm willing to open the keg)
* friendlier towards my sanitizing technique: small amount of sanitizer (or more of boiling water) and shaking and rolling.  can sanitize the lid separately and swap out.  (I assume can't use CO2 to push [enough of] the sanitizer out, but that seems to be equally bad with all ""trubless"" dip tubes)

My main concern is if the lid seals: I have a bunch of ""unjerked"" bought-new kegs, so I'm assuming the lid will seal on those.  My secondary concern is if the solution is good only on paper, and not so nice when you actually use it.

Is My Fermentation Done For?,"Is My Fermentation Done For? So I brewed a fairly large 5 gallon biab stput last week. The OG came out to 1.106 I believe, I added 2 lbs sugar during fermentation. Before the sugar I belive it was around 1.092 or something, forgot to write that down. 

My question is did I kill my fermentation. The scenario was I brewed Monday morning and didn't have a lot of time so I didn't pitch my yeast until that night. I got antsy and jumped the gun with my sugar and ended up boiling it cooling it and pitching it into my fermentation Wednesday morning. 

It fermented strong for a few days now Sunday evening I took a gravity reading and im getting a reading of 1.050. My end goal is 1.017. With all the added simple sugar will my yeasties go back to the maltose? Is there a way to referment this beer? Pitch another starter?

Stats

1. One hour mash at 152
2. I used ph5.2  
3. I built a small starter 800ml of 1.040 with omega Irish ale
4. Poor temperature control also, so its been in my closet and the house is sitting at about 70F.

Not ideal set of circumstances but is there a chance of rescuing this or call it and regret. I need to have this beer by the end of December. I was hoping to let it condition longer but such is life.

Blackberry tart cherry mead,"Blackberry tart cherry mead So I decided that I needed more mead in my life, because I hadn't made any recently.  Looking through what I had ingredient wise, I found a blackberry port kit I got a few years ago and never made.  So I figured might as well make some mead from it.  I went to go and check my honey supply, and found out that the bucket I had crystalized all 2 gallons.  Back in the summer, I saw tart cherry juice at Costco, so I grabbed 4 boxes, or 7 L of the stuff.  So I hatched my plan.  I read how to liquify honey, and that I should never get it over 140 F.

[So out came the sous vide](https://i.imgur.com/cbXMPgu.jpg)

I realized it was set a little too high, so I dropped it down to 140.  4 hours later, it was completely liquid.  

Honey went into the carboy first.  Then the cherry juice.  And finally the blackberry port kit.  I tasted the juice before putting it in, and it had nothing wrong that I could taste.

I added the clarifying agents, toasted oak powder, yeast, and the beginnings of the nutrients.  I stirred it up to aerate, and incorporated everything.

[Ready to start fermenting](https://i.imgur.com/yw9LjGY.jpg)

I didn't take any measurements, because I really don't care.  No water, just 1 gallon of honey, 3 gallons of blackberry juice, and almost 2 gallons of montmorency tart cherry juice.",Homebrewing

Frustrated with end results,"Frustrated with end results Hey fellow brewers,

No matter which recipe I seem to follow or what clone kit I get, the end results have never matched up to the expectations I have for how that beer should turn out. Don't get me wrong, I think it's largely due to me and not necessarily because I'm brewing with extracts.

One of the biggest issues I'm having is getting those punchy hop profiles into the beer. I've followed recipes, boiled, steeped and dry hopped, but what I'm getting is a malt heavy tasting beer. It's driving me insane and I don't know how to fix the problem.

Question about Crystal Malts,"Question about Crystal Malts Just as a thought experiment, I was tring to figure out the effect of substituting different crystal malts, and the effects on the color and flavour profile of a beer. Either when matching existing recipes, or building recipes of your own, how do you pick which Crystal malt to use?

For example, consider a recipe calls for 5% of the grain bill to be Crystal 60L. If you only had Crystal 30L on hand, would it be approximately equivalent to use 10% Crystal 30L instead (twice the amount, half the Lovibond)? Or 2.5% Crystal 120L (twice the Lovibond, half the amount)?

My gut tells me that once you get up to the higher Lovibond numbers, you'll start picking out some more toasty, nutty flavours that weren't present in the lower Lovibond Crystal malts. Perhaps the Crystal 120 was a bit of an extreme example where the equivalency falls apart somewhat. 

But at least for the low-mid range crystal malts (say 15L to 60L), can they all be interchanged with each other as long as one considers the proportion being used? If I only had some Crystal 30L in my inventory, could it be equivalently substituted in place of another Crystal malt in a given recipe by just using proportionately more/less? What differences would I expect from making those substitutions, all other things being equal (same mash profile, base malt, etc)?",Homebrewing

Clove Phenolic in a Lager,"Clove Phenolic in a Lager I have a lager sample in my yeast bank that consistently produces mild clove notes and I thought someone in this reddit would have some insight. 

This spring I pitched dried 34/70 lager yeast into high-gravity wort to make a Maibock at 10% ABV. The beer was clear of any yeast-derived off-flavors. I then used that yeast cake to produce a light lager at under 5% gravity. The light lager was over-carbonated but tasted pleasantly of cloves to everyone who tried it. 

I top-harvested the yeast from the light lager at high-krausen and stored it. I have used the yeast to create 3L starters (stepping up twice from 30ml) and brewed three 5 gallon batches, each having the same clove note.

Experienced tasters and brewers have tasted my beers and I have not had a significant, notable contaminant in my brews in years. I have hundreds of batches of experience. So I believe my sanitation to be reliable and consistent. 

In short, I have a yeast sample that consistently produces phenolic compounds that are indistinguishable from that in Hefeweizen. 

Has the lager yeast mutated to become phenolic, or is there some other microbe contaminating the sample that is pleasantly phenolic? Does a phenolic lager deserve to exist? Is it special and worth preserving or am I just confusing an undesirable off-flavor from some known contaminant with a totally separate ale separate style.",Homebrewing

Does reducing the pH prior to fermentation reduce the amount of acid produced by the yeast?,"Does reducing the pH prior to fermentation reduce the amount of acid produced by the yeast? I've been adding lots of bicarbonate to reduce the tartness of my sugar wash fermentation, and it works decently, but is still a bit acidic for me. I'm starting to wonder if bicarbonate actually causes the yeast to produce *more* organic acids in its efforts to create a healthy environment (the starting pH of my last batch was around 8.2). Could I potentially be better off adding an acid like HCl to get a lower starting pH (around 5), and then adding bases *after* fermentation to reduce acidity?

Also if anyone has any general tips to reduce tartness (perhaps a different yeast strain?) they'd be greatly appreciated. My standard recipe is just 1 gallon DI water, 1 lb dextrose, 4 g Fermaid-O, EC-1118 and various amounts of Sodium/Potassium bicarbonate (aiming for 300 mg/L).

"""Mass"" Production Home Brewing","""Mass"" Production Home Brewing Just wanted to share my methods of brewing large volumes of beer on a medium sized all-grain setup. ""Mass"" being equivalent of 4 corney kegs. Anyway I think it could be useful for anyone looking to double their output without having to buy any new equipment. This method could be used on a single batch setup (to now make 2 batches) or on a 2 batch system (to now make 4).

* You will need to have two heating pots and a mash tun big enough to fit the extra grain 

I have a typical three vessel setup. 14 gal HLT/strike water pot, 14 gal mash tun, 14 gal brew pot. In a typical method you can only get two batches per brew out of this setup (about 12 gallons of finished wort)

Start with the mash as per usual, adjusting for the extra grain and strike water. In my case its usually around 36-40 lbs of grain and 11-13 gallons of water. This is super close to the top of the mash tun but less head space equals less heat loss, haha.

I then heat 14 gallons of sparge water while I mash, then start the transfer of water to mash, wort to boil kettle. Once the boil kettle is full I fill the mash with the rest of the sparge water to the top. Empty the HLT of any water, and continue to drain the rest of the wort into the HLT vessel. (About 10-12 gallons). There will be a small deficit of sparge water around the end, about 4 or 5 gallons, so I continue to sparge with 140 degree tap water. If some of you dont like that then I suppose you could pre heat some extra sparge water and keep it in an extra pot until you get to this point. I however feel this small amount of tap water is a non issue to flavour or quality in any manner.

You now have 1 pot of extra sugary wort and 1 pot of less sugary wort, but now totalling double you usual volume. You can now boil each as per usual, hopping just one pot, (remember to adjust the hops for the total batch volume). Doesnt matter which pot you hop in my experience. I usually just hop the first one to start boiling. 

Once boil is complete I run one pot at a time through the counter flow chiller into my 4 carboys being sure to divide each pot equally. 3 gallons of extra sugary wort into each carboy and then 2.5 gallons of watery wort into each carboy. 

If you dont like the separated boil pots or you want to try 2 different hop profiles from the same mash you can combine the wort using the mash tun or another vessel. If anyone is interested I can show you how I do that as well.

Anyway this is how I double my output. My brew days almost always consist of 4 batches which I usually find ways of making them all different through dry hopping and pot additions while all coming from the same mash. I then have extra for trading for another style with another brewer or a bunch of one beer for an event or ways of experimenting with the effects of different dry hop additions or yeasts on the same wort. 

And if anyone is wondering why I dont get bigger pots, its because:
1.I have already invested in this setup which I had originally planned to make double batches with. 
2. Space is already crammed as it is
3. Boiling that much liquid in one vessel would require major heating. 
4.This way I can heat two smaller amounts at the same time, barely increasing the overall brew day.",Homebrewing

How long does a keg last once tapped?,"How long does a keg last once tapped? I’ve been brewing for years but have always bottled my beer. I’ve always been tempted by the ease of kegging, but it takes me awhile to get through a 5 gal batch, and I’m not sure I could consume the beer fast enough before it gets gross in the keg. 

I’m sure it varies by style, but what is the max average time you’d allow a beer to sit around in a tapped keg?

Currently, I probably have bottles sitting around for 3 months or so per batch. Is there any way beer could last close to that long in a keg?",Homebrewing
Today was a good day,"Today was a good day I've been frustrated lately with my beers, either with low efficiency or not hitting the correct volumes. But today I was right on the money. I even checked the sparging gravity and was at 1.016, so I could have squeezed some more sugars out. If there's a moral, I guess it's keep going, though I know nobody here was really contemplating giving up!

Anyways, today's beer is a stout that I'm also adding oak cubes that have been sitting on JB for a month. There's still a chance for a mishap, but I'm happy I got the brewhouse process today.

 8 lbs pale
  
 5 lbs Munich

 1 lb special B
 
 1 lb choc
 
 .5 lb roasted barley for the last ten minutes of the mash

OG was 1.071, yeast is S04. 43 IBU coming from .9 oz Simcoe with a 90 minute boil. I may have been able to boil a tad more, but I'd rather have a little extra in the kettle than be well under 5.5 gallons.  

The real science here is that I'm adding the 1.5 oz oak cubes with the yeast, and I'm going to give it about 2 weeks until I give it a taste. RDWHAHB.",Homebrewing

The effect of mash pH on efficency,"The effect of mash pH on efficency I just mashed for a pseudopilsne with lutra and swedish heritage hops ""näs"" . I use biab on a induction stove with lhbs single crush malt. I do a single still water sparge with 12,5% of the mash volume. Usually i get about 70% mash efficency.

Recently i got even more involved in the process and started using pH strips and brewers friend water calculator to adjust pH. This has caused my efficency to climb 10% points. Thought this might be a intresting point for those strugling with efficency and to show the importance of pH.

This effect was demonstrated on a dark mild single infusion mashed at 64C for 60min (78%) and the current pilsner that got a slightly more complicated mashing protocol since the manufacturers of lutra kveik recomended a protein rest. 52C 15 min, then 62C 30 min and finally 69C for 30min. This yielded 82% mash efficency with some wort wasted due to fresh hops.

My first semi-grain brew from my local brew shop. [Link](https://i.imgur.com/cCUdqKZ.jpg)

Og was 1.051. Supposed to be 5.6% abv, but after two weeks it was stuck at 1.03. It's still stuck there after I repitched some lager yeast a week ago.

Having talked to u/audis4gasm on one of the daily threads, I concluded that I steeped the mash at WAY TOO high a temperature. My first time using this and I need to get my mom's candy thermometer for next time, methinks.

So, I screwed it up. Having Googled this for days, I've come to four possible fixes:

1)Glucoamylase;
2)Beano;
3)Tossing my cacao in a cup and a half of vodka, and then dumping *that* into the fermenter; or

Homebrewing Help,"Homebrewing Help I'm a new homebrewer, but long time homebrew-appreciator, and am having some problems.

My setup: Brewzilla 35L, Fermentasaurus, Corny Keg. 

I have brewed 4 or 5 batches so far, and every one tastes weak/watery. I am aware that ""water has no taste"", but it tastes like the beer has been mixed with water. I have made 2 or 3 batches with kits and 2 or 3 batches with all grain. They all have had the same problem, to varying degrees.

I am assuming I am doing something wrong.

Here are the steps I follow to make each batch:

1) Fill brewzilla with some water. The recipe book I follow is for stovetop and doesn't take into account the false bottom of the brewzilla, so I generally have to add much more water to start than the recipe calls for. The amount of water is still less than the total water required for the batch, however.

2) Heat water to strike temp

3) Add grain, lower to mash temp

4) Mash for 60 minutes, stirring every 10. I don't have a mash paddle, so I'm using a large wooden spoon.

5) Lauter for a few minutes

6) Pull out mash, let drain

7) Sparge until the water in the brewzilla hits the target amount for the recipe. The water is not pre-heated, but ""hot"" from the tap

8) Boil for 1 hour, add hops as per schedule

9) Turn off boil, chill with counterflow until temp is between 68-80; usually pitch in low to mid 70s.

10) dump into fermenter and pitch.

11) Ferment for 10 days

12) Transfer to corny keg, set PSI to 15

13) Wait 3 days, set PSI to 10-12

14) Drink

Stout tanks mash tun,"Stout tanks mash tun I'm putting together a system upgrade and going with a two vessel no-sparge setup for 10 gallon batches.

Initially I had planned on two spike kettles, and I have already purchased my custom 20g boil kettle. Before ordering my tun, I discovered the stout tanks mash tun that has a bottom drain. On my 3 vessel propane setup I was using an inverted keg with the bottom cut off, and having a bottom drain made cleaning pretty easy.

So right now I'm trying to decide whether to get the spike kettle with a dip tube, or the stout tanks kettle with bottom drain. I think the price would be close in the end after adding the false bottom to a 20g spike kettle, maybe a little less since shipping is free. I guess not having matching kettles could be considered a downside if you're OCD.

The SS brewtech mash tun is nice looking, but I don't know why they always insist on ruining a nice triclamp set-up by adding one weldless fitting to everything. The insulation is also not necessary since I'll be using a RIMS.

I brewed this 15G of an IPA and fermented with kveik.

I got covid and could not go to the brewery to check stuff because isolation so the fermenter has been sitting here for a month and a half without touching it. No temp control and the room is at 25C at most in the day and it drops at night.

Now I came to check it and it has a pellicile :(.

Help with stalled big stout fermentation,"Help with stalled big stout fermentation I’ve tried to read as many other posts about stalled fermentation as I can but still a little unsure on my best course of action here so looking for some advice.

Brewed a big stout 12 days ago, still an extract brewer so used 12lbs LME, 1lb DME, 2lbs total of a few steeping grains and 1lb of lactose. OG 1.114 (expected was 1.116), expected FG of 1.029 and ABV of 11.3%.

Pitched 2 packets of US-05 at 70 degrees, kept in an ice bath (Fridge coming this weekend!) at around 65 degrees so thinking it was ~70 in the fermenter. Took a reading with hydrometer 2 days ago and it was at 1.051 and then another today with same reading so looks like it’s stalled.

Should I pitch another pack of US-05? Should I rehydrate? Add yeast nutrient? Aerate? 

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Cheers!",Homebrewing
Using ancient mead recipe to Make something Interesting today,"Using ancient mead recipe to Make something Interesting today I will use ancient mead recipe to make something interesting today.

Recipe will find from this link:

https://www.lowcostliving.co.uk/home-brewing/ancient-mead-recipe/

i will use:

5 litres container

1,3kg honey

1-3 tablespoon herbs including: rosemary, thyme and bay leaves

half clove

littlebit grated nutmeg and ginger

black tea

1 decilitre raisins

pale ale malts, crystal malts and barley malts

about those malts on the recipe were this "" take rosemary, thyme, bay leaves and sweet briar one handful together; boil it an hour, put it into a tub with a little ground malt; stir it till it is lukewarm; strain it through a cloth ""

so my question is what kind of taste little bit malt will do to my mead? i will use 3-4 decilitre pale ale malt, 2 tablespoon crystal malt and 2 teaspoon barley malt. i will mash it 10 minutes in 48 °C, then 20 minutes in 63 °C and last 15 minutes in 73 °C after that i will boil it 20 minutes so i kill all bacteries and this bacterias killing is that reason why i want to do it this way (mash and boil instead of just stirr those malts in warm water). Also im interested what would cascade or chinook hop pellets do to this mead if i boil those only 5 minutes so i could get little bit taste out of those without making it bitter..?",Homebrewing

Hard cider secondary and flavoring?,"Hard cider secondary and flavoring? Hey all I’ve never made a hard cider from fresh-pressed juice and primary fermentation is pretty much complete.  I was curious as to what people have tried that has worked for adding things in secondary.

It tastes fantastic right now, I honestly just wanted to stick a straw in the carboy and drink it the other night (kidding sort of).  I initially was thinking of back sweetening with caramel and having a still cider but now I’m torn because it tastes so great as-is, that I almost want to let it sit in secondary for a month or 2 and then add priming sugar and bottle it.  

Does anyone have any thoughts or examples of what they’ve done with a cider that was bone-dry that really brought it to the next level?

After using my CO2 tank for a while, I can say that serving from my keg is a pain in the ass. However, I just realized that my CO2 regulator is probably not one built for beverages. 

The pressure dial goes from 10 psi MINIMUM to 230 psi. Like, it's clearly not ideal: I don't need anything above 50 psi and I essentially can't dial into a nice serving pressure (1-2 psi). Also last time I got a new CO2 tank refill, there was a lot of sputtering, a variable flow rate, and a bit of liquid CO2 coming out the gas line. It froze over pretty hard for a bit, though it seems to be mostly in working order now. 

I bought this one off of Craigslist for 25 bucks. Should I buy a new one that can handle a pressure range more suitable for serving beer and other beverages?

The beer was brewed on Sunday and about a day ago the gravity hit 1.012 and hasn't budged since then.  So, I'm wondering if there is any reason to not go ahead and bottle?  Some things I've read have said the beer will continue to ""condition"" (although I don't understand exactly what that means, aside from perhaps some flavors continuing to develop) even after fermentation has ended, but my thought is why not just go ahead and let that happen in the bottle instead of the fermenter, and get a head start on letting the beer carbonate?

(And if it matters, the yeast was WLP565 which apparently gives a pretty aggressive fermentation.  BeerSmith estimated my FG would be 1.020.  I started it at 65ºF then bumped it up to 80ºF over a couple of days, since I'd read that will encourage the yeast to produce more of the Saison flavors I'm looking for.

But I'm wondering if anyone has tips to get that yeast to express itself better for a Saison. Or if anyone has any flatout rejections to the plan. Honestly, I'm kind of feeling like it'll be a nice spin on a Saison, but I haven't even brewed a Saison yet or used that yeast. 

The last time I made a Witbier I ended up having to use [Imperial Rustic B56](https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/belgian-ale/rustic), and that turned out surprisingly well. Obviously again, more Saison than Wit but still completely drinkable and still Witbier like. So that's another option I guess, using Rustic for both. 

I'm expecting the answer to be as straightforward as obviously each yeast is suited for their styles. Decide which brew you want to sacrifice as not being to style. But maybe it'll yield some interesting conversation!",Homebrewing

"For those who hate bottling, but still do it, try 22oz","For those who hate bottling, but still do it, try 22oz The title pretty much explains the point. My homebrew school in town (yes there is a LHBS that also has as a brewing school next door) strictly uses 22oz bottles when they have their students bottle beer. The reason was that most people don't just drink 1 bottle of homebrew at a time, and this would save loads of time and space during the bottling process. I couldn't agree more.

The cost for a 24 pack of 12oz bottles is only $1 cheaper on morebeer than a 12 pack of 22oz (not promoting, just using for cost comparison). So for spending $1 more you can almost get the same volume, but you have to cap less, sanitize less, and clean less.

I still have 12oz bottles for any super high abv or if I'm getting to the end of the bottling bucket and I don't think I can fill a 22oz. Or if you sample your beer during the carbonation phase to see if it is finished, you don't need to open a big bottle.",Homebrewing

40% Brewhouse Efficiency on Brewzilla,"40% Brewhouse Efficiency on Brewzilla Hi all,

Just finished brewing what was supposed to be an Imperial Stout. Been brewing for almost 3 years now with relatively good results except for hazy beer. However, this is my fourth brew with the new Brewzilla 3.1.1. On my first brew, efficiency was 52% and then on my second and third I managed to bring this up to 64%. However, today, I had the awfully pathetic 42% brewhouse efficiency that makes me want to either retire or set this device on fire.

I was supposed to end around 1.079 and ended at 1.050. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's still a drinkable 5.5%-ish stout but not what I wanted to brew. Standard 5 gallon brew, with RO water and adjusted chemistry. Ph was fine too. Sparge was fine. No stuck mash or sparge either. Milled most of my grains except for the Chocolate and Black Malt. Also did what other Brewzilla users have suggested which is stir twice during the first half hour of the mash. The only difference for me was that instead of brewing at 67C/152F I brewed at 70C/158F with the intention of increasing the body.

Any clue what the hell could have happened here?

SMB addition to NEIPA creating sulfur smell - Have I f**ked up?,"SMB addition to NEIPA creating sulfur smell - Have I f**ked up? I'm getting a strong smell of sulfur (rotton egg smell) when I open up my beer 7 days after bottling, the following sections is where I feel like I messed up. I'm hoping after a couple more weeks, the strong sulfur smell goes away in the bottle. It hasn't changed the taste of the beer, though there is no proper taste from that initial 7 day bottle taste test, as I'm expecting a flavour to come about after the 3 week mark from bottling.

I decided to brew a roughly 5 gal (22L) NEIPA and after reading so much about Brülosophy's experiments decided to add more SMB powder than was recommended. It was roughly 1g of SMB, where the recommended amount was 0.3g for the size of the batch. This was partly due to not having a scale to measure it to that precise amount, but in hindsight now: I'm thinking when I diluted the powder in a cup of water, I could have just measured out roughly a third of the cup.

In addition to this, I think the step where I added the powder was probably wrong too: I decided to ferment real mango fruit (following the correct freezing and defrosting methods) 7 days after initial pitching of the yeast. Instructions told me to add it the fermenter before bottling, but I'm not sure how much this would have played an effect. Because I was nervous about oxidation, I decided to add that cup of SMB at this phase, which led into another short fermentation with the sugar that was released by the mango. The smell that was released was a strong sulfur smell, which I disregarded because I knew it was because of the SMB.

What I'm hoping to hear is some reassurance that this has happened to someone and that sulfur smell just goes away in the next 2 weeks during that conditioning process. Otherwise will it just smell like that every time someone opens up the bottle? The smell slowly dissipated as I left the drink in a glass as I understand the sulfur is able to reduce as it is exposed to the atmosphere.",Homebrewing

"Help, OG is Half of Expected Value","Help, OG is Half of Expected Value Hey everyone,

I put [this](https://byo.com/article/the-king-of-stouts/) Old Rasputin clone (5th one down) into  Brewfather yesterday, resulting in [this](https://share.brewfather.app/eHc2uMipTFbOOP) recipe. I brewed it yesterday and had the following problems:
- The recipe called for 6.13 gallons of mash water which should result in a ""mash volume (water + grain)"" of 7.63 gallons according to Brewfather. I poured the grain in then filled it with water and it ended up being 8.5 gallons.
- I have an Ssbrewtech mash tun and used the Vorlouf attachment for 5 minutes, 45 minuted into the mash. I then used the recirculation manifold for the remaining 10 minutes of the mash. I then sparged the remaining 2.56 gallons of water. However, the had grain settled to the bottom so the top was a few gallons of liquid (see [here](https://imgur.com/a/rol5K0G)) and I'm not sure I got anything out of the vorlouf or sparge other than additional water.
- I then transferred to a kettle, but I only ended up with 6 gallons of water instead of the grainfather calculated 6.5 gallons. I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do, but I just topped it up to 6.5 gallons.
- By then end of the 60 minute boil, I had 5.15 gallons of wort instead of the Brewfather calculated 5.69. i had just estimated a boil-off rate of 0.81 gallons per hour, but ended up closer to 1.4 gallons. Is that too much or did I measure something wrong?
- I lost my counterflow wort chiller so I just used my glycol chiller in a Grainfather fermenter. As such I wasn't able to pitch the yeast until this morning.

Anyways, I should have ended up with about 5.4 gallons of wort at 1.098, but only ended up with 5.1 gallons at 1.048. I'm brewing another beer today, what do I need to do differently? My major concern was all the water on top of the grain bed in the mash, but I'm not sure if this is an issue. It could also be the Tilt's calibration, but I'm not sure.

Purp-ale? Beer-gundy?,"Purp-ale? Beer-gundy? [Beer Pic](https://i.imgur.com/8fUGQdZ.jpg)

A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/ho61uk/purple_heifer_recipe_tap_handle_and_pour/) reminded me that I've had some [butterfly pea flower tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BTI2AVO/) for a while that I had intended to try in a beer (for no particularly good reason).

I have a nice honey blonde ale recipe that I've made a few times before that seemed like a good base.  Scaled down to a 2.5 gallon batch:

* 5.6% ABV, 22 IBU.
* 1.045 OG (1.051 with honey), 1.008 FG.
* 4lb. 4oz. 2 Row
* 4oz. C15
* 4oz. Honey Malt
* 4oz. Flaked Oats
* 8oz. Honey, added post-fermentation
* 17 IBU Willamette @60min.
* 0.5oz. Willamette @5min.
* US-05
* Yellow Balanced Bru'n Water profile (75 SO4, 60 Cl), pH target 5.30

Single infusion mash at 155 for 60 minutes, mashed a bit high to prevent the late honey addition from drying it out too much.  Fermented at 67F.

Once fermentation was complete, I filled a coffee mug with butterfly pea flower tea (about 20 grams).  I then poured boiling water on it, let it steep for a few minutes, and strained the liquid off.  I did that 3 times, which left ~8oz. of very dark blue tea.  I let it cool to ~100F and then dissolved the [raw honey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L4G2PBJ/) and added the resulting ~16oz. of liquid to the fermenter, which kicked off a secondary fermentation that lasted for a couple days.  My hope was that the fermentation from the honey would also minimize oxygen addition from the tea.

I raised the temp to 70F for a couple more days, then cold crashed and added gelatin (don't want a murky purple beer), and kegged the next day.

The beer doesn't look quite as in-your-face purple as some examples I've seen, but it's a very pleasing reddish-purple (almost crimson?) color.  The tea flavor itself is very mild, it doesn't really come through in the finished beer at all.  To my memory it tastes the same as previous versions without the tea... a nice smooth blonde ale with a subtle (but definitely present) honey flavor and aroma.

There is a slight astringency on the back end... since I didn't use a proper strainer, which I would definitely do if I tried this again, it's possible that I ended up squeezing the leaves when I was trying to separate the liquid (though, since it's not technically a tea, I don't know if you really get much astringency from it).  The honey flavor comes through nicely in the beer though, so a touch of tea-like astringency doesn't actually feel out of place.",Homebrewing

Haven't brewed with adjuncts in a while... Or how I saved a batch from near loss.,"Haven't brewed with adjuncts in a while... Or how I saved a batch from near loss. I brewed a chocolate orange porter last night and used adjuncts for the first time in a few years (cacao nibs and dry sweet orange peel). My first mistake was brewing in the evening - I am notoriously careless and rush more when I brew at night. My second mistake was adding the cacao nibs and sweet orange peel to the boiling worst sans filter/bag/basket. I should have added them to my hop basket at least but my mistake didn't become apparent until I started recirculating during cool-down. My pump clogged immediately and in that moment I realized my mistake. I let the wort finish chilling and then disconnected my pump (it was loaded with nibs) and tried to drain it into the fermenter using just gravity, but there was also a clog in my ball-valve. Feeling desperate, I sanitized my arm and reached into my chilled wort and unscrewed the back of the valve - nothing. I then realized what I had to do: I sanitized the end of my ball-valve, put my mouth around it, and blew back into the kettle. Beer immediately started flowing and I was able to mostly fill my fermenter... until it clogged again. This time I had my wife hold a (sanitized) strainer basket over the fermenter lip and I lifted the kettle and poured directly through the strainer.

Wine SG dropping slowly,"Wine SG dropping slowly Hi,

To be able to monitor my wines I usually put a hydrometer inside my fermenter.

For a lot of my previous wines, the SG has fallen from for example \~90 to \~10 in 14 days. However, with my current redcurrant wine, it is dropping extremely slowly.

Here's the log:

Oct 28: 90° Oe (Starting)

Oct 30: 85° Oe 

Oct 31: 81° Oe 

Nov 2: 75° Oe 

Nov 5: 72° Oe 

Nov 6: 69° Oe 

Nov 8: 66° Oe 

Nov 11: 62° Oe 

Doing a simple regression on these numbers tells me that the fermentation will take over 2 months to complete, which is kind of ridiculous considering the wine is fermenting at \~25° C (77° F) ... In my calculation I consider that the fermentation will slow down as the alcohol percentage grows as well - which worries me even more. Is this normal fermentation time? Am I just being impatient? The only other time I've had a fermentation go this slow, it stalled at 50°Oe for two weeks at which point I cleared it and added a bunch of lemon to try and mask the sugary taste (it was *okay...*)",Homebrewing

Looking for advice on custom eBIAB kettle/basket,"Looking for advice on custom eBIAB kettle/basket I'm planning on upgrading my eBIAB setup with a 20 gallon Spike custom kettle with a mesh basket.

For the kettle I know I'll need three TC ports for the drain valve, thermowell, and heating element, but I'm not sure what the best option for recirculation is. Right now I have a whirlpool return through the top of the kettle that works pretty well, and figure I can use something like [this whirlpool arm](https://www.norcalbrewingsolutions.com/store/Tri-Clover-1.5-Inch-Custom-Whirlpool-Arm.html) for both mash recirculation and whirlpooling. However I've seen a lot of configurations with a lower port for the return (just above the drain valve) so I'm wondering: is there any difference just placing the recirculation return lower with just a pickup tube inside? Is there any downside to just recirculating water *around* the basket instead of through it?

For the basket I've been eyeing the [BIAB filters from Utah Biodiesel](https://www.utahbiodieselsupply.com/brewingfilters.php#biab). Does anyone have experience with these or something similar?

"Stouts, Gravity, Refractometers, Maths... Help?","Stouts, Gravity, Refractometers, Maths... Help? I recently popped a Fundamental Observation from Bottle Logic, and while I'm not trying to clone it per se, it's in the range of flavor profile and mouthfeel I'd like to learn how to create.  I'd gotten a lot of great advice on here about stouts, but 5 brews later things just weren't connecting, so I saved a little from the bottle, let it go flat, then threw it on my refractometer....and saw it was at 25°!

I did some ""math"" (I played on a refractometer brix conversion calculator till I got it right), and figure if the bottle is 14.1% and the FG was 25°, that means the OG was 40.3° (according to the brewers friend refractometer calculator with a wort correction of 1)

Ok... so that kind of makes sense, except that going from the refractometer page on brewersfriend to their ABV calculator page and plugging in the gravity numbers given from brix conversions, it's showing a difference of 1.52% ABV .    Let me try to illustrate:  


**On the refractometer page (lines up with what I saw, and the bottle's stated ABV):**   
OG  :: 40.3°  \~  1.181  
FG  :: 25.0°  \~ 1.062  
WCF :: 1.00  
ABV :: 14.1%

**Plugging the gravities into the ABV Calculator Page:**   
OG :: 1.181  
FG  ::  1.062  
ABV :: 15.62%  (and it takes setting the OG to 1.170 to get close to the target ABV of 14.1%)

So all of that laid out, now I've got three questions:    
\------------------

1) What is going on with the varying ABVs between the refractometer and the ABV calculator using standard gravity ?

2) Which Original Gravity do I aim for when designing a grainbill :: the 1.181 or the 1.170?

3) Finally, and this one could be it's own thread, but I'm using Beersmith2 on an old computer to design the grainbill (I know I should update already, but in the meantime...).   My plan was to use my fermentable malts (base and caramel) to achieve the target ABV according to beersmith, then add in all the specialty malts (chocolate, carafe special III, and other low-fermentable malts with minimal actual ABV impact, so I'm ignoring their impact on ABV), and finally, use Carapils to raise the gravity until I hit the target for OG (ignoring how it impacts the ABV since in reality it wont), and then :: Is that design process right?",Homebrewing

"Batch size, dry hopping amount, slightly confusing terminology","Batch size, dry hopping amount, slightly confusing terminology I’ve always been slightly confused about this, but I’ve never bothered to ask until now. When people refer to batch size that could mean a whole lot of different things such as the amount they end up kegging, or the amount going into the fermenter, or the amount in their kettle post boil. Usually I can scale the recipe to what I have as my equipment to reach the OG / FG. 

However the hops are still confusing to me. For example on a recent episode of Experimental Brewing, Scott Janish mentioned that sapwood cellars likes to whirlpool with about 2 pounds per barrel. What is it exactly? Is it 2 pounds per barrel of wort that ultimately makes it into the fermenter? Or 2 pounds per barrel of the stuff they are actually able to keg? Those could definitely be a lot different depending on hop absorption and losses. Same question applies to dry hop amount. 

I’ve seen quite a few recipes where the batch size is the post boil volume. The person who wrote the recipe could be potentially leaving behind a gallon or more of stuff behind… But I don’t know that. What should I be doing with the amount of hops that they specify for the recipe say I am targeting 5 gallons into my fermenter. Hope this makes sense.",Homebrewing

So in my naivity I tightened it as much as I could connected everything up (including the gas input) and turned on the gas. Immediately the pressure shot up on the regulator hitting 60psi and gas started blowing out the safety valve.

For those (I can't imagine there are many) who don't know what an irish car bomb is, you take a half pint of guinness, and drop in a shot of half jameson and half irish cream. Promptly slam it down.

My home brew idea is to infuse a bottle of jameson for a few weeks with vanilla beans, a few cocoa nibs, and a few espresso beans to get an irish cream flavor going, and then brew a milk stout with lactose for a nice creamy mouth feel, add the infused whiskey to the bottling bucket before priming and bottling.

Question 1... Is this idea feasible or is there a better way anyone would suggest to get the desired flavor?

Question 2... How much whiskey is enough/too much? I figured that in a 5 gallon batch (640 oz), the equivalent of one shot per pint in an actual car bomb would be around 40 oz. That is a LOT of whiskey. So I thought one 750ml bottle would suffice to give a good flavor to the stout and not overdo the alcohol.",Homebrewing

What two hop combo would you suggest for a dank and tropical Hazy IPA/NEIPA,"What two hop combo would you suggest for a dank and tropical Hazy IPA/NEIPA So I’ve made a bunch of NEIPAs and they’ve all been good to decent but I have yet to really nail the flavor I’m after. I think it would be described as dank but fruity. Certainly not piney, more of a green or just hoppy taste with a tropical edge that makes me think of overripe fruit or just hop juice.

Closest I’ve come was Mosaic/Citra/Galaxy but it just wasn’t really dank enough.

Other notable combos that fell short:
Sabro/Mosaic/Eldorado
Mosaic/Citra
Citra/Galaxy
Mosaic/Citra/Eldorado

Now, there is one commercial beer here that really has a lot of the qualities I’m after. They use Columbus/Centennial/Citra in a 1:2:3 ratio for both boil and dry hop.

For efficiency purposes and using whole bags a two hop combo would be preferable to me. I’m leaning trying Columbus/Citra or Columbus/Mosaic in a 1:1 ratio for both boil and dry hop. What do you think, will it give me a dank enough beer? Any other hop or ingredient suggestions very welcome!",Homebrewing
Tweaking a dry stout to make it maltier,"Tweaking a dry stout to make it maltier I have a stout recipe that I have made a few times now that I am satisfied enough with that it has sort of become my go-to stout. It has nice, roasty notes and I am happy with the depth of flavor. But it is also very dry, which is fine, but I prefer my stouts with some malt. I don't want the sweetness of a milk stout -- not in my go-to, anyway -- just something with a pleasant hit of malt, but I am not really sure where to go.

My base malt is Maris Otter, with small additions of flaked barley, chocolate malt, and roasted barley malt, hopped with Fuggle to 40 IBU. I mash around 152°F. I have looked at other recipes, but I like the one I'm using and would prefer to tweak it rather than going whole-hog into another recipe.

The main thing I have tried so far is to simply change the yeast (White London Ale -&gt; Wyeast London Ale III -- so okay, not exactly a dramatic leap). While that did change the flavor profile a bit, it did not have a pronounced impact on malt character. I thought I had also tried a stepped mash or a higher mash temp, but my notes tell me that is not the case.

Some ideas I'm considering:

* Subbing in Munich for part of the Maris Otter
* Adding another character malt
* Decoction mashing (possibly in addition to the Munich)
* Dialing back the hops to something like 20-25 IBU to see if maybe they're masking something

I'm interested in eventually making a doppelbock, so even though decoction is not traditional for stout, I'm kind of looking at it as a reduced-risk way for me to try my hand at it (I guess I won't ruin my stout if I make a newbie mistake). Based on what I have read, though, I'm not convinced that decoction alone will yield much extra malt flavor from my particular grain bill (hence considering doing in addition to adding Munich).

Other character malts I have on hand are Cara Hell, Cara Munich I-III, Cara Aroma, and brown malt -- I'm thinking one of the Caras might help. And of course, I also have flaked oats.",Homebrewing

"Why are we told not to open the fermenter, but when taking samples it's sort of deemed okay?","Why are we told not to open the fermenter, but when taking samples it's sort of deemed okay? I was thinking about this when taking the final readings for my latest brew. People seem to say that opening the fermenter is a bad idea because it lets in oxygen and that can ruin your beer - especially a NEIPA (more on that below). So why is it ""okay"" to open the fermenter to take a hydrometer sample? 

Personally I will just get it through the airlock, which will still let oxygen in I'm sure because there will be a concentration gradient, but the opening is a lot smaller than removing the entire lid. 

Is it because there will be a ""blanket of CO2""? I would have thought that the CO2 would disappear after opening the fermenter for the first time. If not the second, assuming fermentation is complete?

I also see oxidation fears a lot in relation to NEIPAs. But what makes them more susceptible? Is it because by design they're heavily dry hopped and so as a result you're opening the fermenter a lot, or is it something to do with the haze required or the malts used?",Homebrewing
Any homebrewers from Europe? Question about Electric brewery system.,"Any homebrewers from Europe? Question about Electric brewery system. Hi!

Sorry about the long post! Anyway:

I want to elevate my homebrewing with purchasing/making something more reliable. So far I am using one kettle and gas stove. No bag, no pump, simple thermostat. I miss my mashing temp by good 2-3 degrees of Celsius, maybe even more, hard to tell. Heat source is on the bottom and temp meter is in the middle, and I am constantly hitting it with my spatula. I have to lauter to separate container, clean the kettle so I can boil it. And so on. Sometimes the difficulty is fun, but I would rather make it more efficiently. 

First to say I do not want All-in-one brewing system. My long term (really long term) is that IF I enjoy making beer, and be able to consistently pull off an enjoyable product, I will make a microbrewery. I have hospitality background run a family hotel with a restaurant, and thinking going to also another direction for several years. Also I have property in the city center that would make a great place to build one.

I have already preselected Brewing system, Either I will go 2 Vessel system and upgrade it to the 3 Vessels in the future. Or straight up buy 3 vessels system.

Help Putting Recipe in Brewfather,"Help Putting Recipe in Brewfather Hey everyone,

I'm new to homebrewing beer and I am trying to utilize Brewfather more for all of my batches and recipes. I want to make an Old Rasputin clone following [this](https://byo.com/article/the-king-of-stouts) recipe (it's the fifth one down), but I am having trouble putting the recipe into Brewfather. [This](https://share.brewfather.app/eHc2uMipTFbOOP) is what I currently have in Brewfather. 

The problem is that the gain bill is over 18 lbs. After milling it, it came out to about 4-4.5 gallons. However, the water calculation in Brewfather is showing a 7.63 gallon mash volume (water + grain) with 6.13 gallons of mash water and only 1.5 gallons for the grain. Furthermore, it's showing a total water bill of 8.64 gallons and I'm not sure where it's getting that because my pre-boil volume is 6.64 gallons. I'm guessing it's getting that from the grain absorbtion, but I'm not sure. The recipe says to add 5.85 gallons of spike water at 165 F to the grains, wait an hour, then sparge up to 6.5 gallons. With a 60 minute boil time and a 0.4 qt/lb grain absorption rate, that would leave just 3.79 gallons for this 5 gallon recipe. So any help putting this recipe into Brewfather would definitely be appreciated. If anyone could also explain what Brewfather means by ""top-up water"" I would appreciate it because I didn't understand their definition.

Also, I have about a 0.3 gallon fermenter loss so I would also like to know how I can scale this recipe. Should I just use 5 gallons for the recipe then 5.3 gallons for the batch?

Thank you!",Homebrewing

Controlling Nottingham Attenuation,"Controlling Nottingham Attenuation I recently got back into homebrewing, and I have always been an enthusiastic user of dry yeast.  More specifically, I have always loved Nottingham for it's reliability, consistency, and neutral to slightly fruity profile.  Also, the fact that it ferments nearly the same from the 50s to the low 70s.  I realize that countless people use liquid yeast and get fantastic results.  Personally, I just know I don't have the time or patience to worry about the relative fragility of liquid yeast or the increased cost when compared to dry yeast.

With that out of the way, I have brewed two all-grain beers on an ANVIL Foundry system.  The first beer I brewed was a Scottish Export Ale, which turned out great.  It finished *slightly* drier than I would have liked, but it was within normal range for Notty.  It went from 1.051 to 1.011 in 7 days for 78% attenuation.  So, when I brewed my most recent beer, an Oatmeal Stout, I decided to experiment with higher mash temperatures to reign in the attenuation of Notty.  I realize I could have used Windsor, S-04, or many other Dry English Ale Yeasts that do not naturally attenuate as highly as Nottingham, but still, I was curious.  Also, I do not have the ability/space/budget to do temperature controlled fermentation, unless you count room temperature.  This is another reason Nottingham is so appealing to me.  Also, I had a spare pack in my fridge, and I am cheap to a fault.

I mashed quite high, at about 158-159F.  When all was said and done, I ended up at an SG of 1.051 for the stout.  Nine days later, I kegged the beer and took a FG reading.  Well, for those of you that already know how this story ends, it turns out that higher mash temps do in fact have a significant impact on fermentation, even if the yeast is an aggressive one like Notty.  It took it down to 1.020 at 68F, so only 60% attenuation!  Honestly, I was fine with it.  I was hoping for more like 1.015, but now I know I can control my fermentation with mash temperature and still use my preferred yeast.  In the future when I make this beer again, I will mash at more like 154-155F and see where that gets me.  The good news is the stout is delicious, and it was a fun experiment.  Cheers.",Homebrewing

Options for Inexpensive Glycol Cooling Coils?,"Options for Inexpensive Glycol Cooling Coils? I have a DIY mini-fridge glycol system that works pretty well. I run the glycol solution using discharge tubing wrapped around the outside of the SS fermenters, and it works great. The only downside is that it gets cold in my garage, and it can be hard to keep beers warm (70F+) using a 25W heating pad. Doing kveik at high temps is out of the question currently. In the past I would keep kveik warm using a light bulb, but can't do that with the discharge hose setup, since it covers the fermenter and defeats the purpose of a glycol cooling system if you heat the solution up in the tubing.

So to compensate, I was going to switch out the discharge hose with a more standard in-fermenter cooling coil, so I can use light as a heat source again. The two inexpensive options that I've found are the KegLand Temp Twister or the Anvil Cooling Coil (eliminating Spike and SS on cost grounds). Are there other options out there that I should take a look at?

Of those two, any reason to prefer one over the other? My initial inclination is to grab the Temp Twister, since it's 3/8"" OD and my glycol tubing lines are 3/8"", so it'd be easier to convert.",Homebrewing

Should I disconnect the pump to pour what remains in the silicon tubing into the kettle? My worry is if I leave it, that’s a good amount of unboiled wort going into the fermenter, and is that safe?

Additionally, if I’m using the pump to transfer to fermenter, do I have to sanitize the lines in some way between mash and boil? Which wouldn’t be a problem if I’ve already disconnected the pump to boil.

Any tips? Maybe I’m just really over thinking here.",Homebrewing
Question About Conical's and Dumping yeast,"Question About Conical's and Dumping yeast So I was just gifted a Spike Brewing 14 gallon Fermenter for my birthday. I am planning on going to 10 gallon batches. I currently have an SS Brewtech 7 gallon conical. I've never once dumped the yeast. When a beer is ready for dry hopping, I just transfer into a corny keg under pressure. I then let it sit there for a couple days, and then cold crash and transfer to the serving keg.

Since I will be doing 10 gallon batches, I would need 4 kegs just to do one batch. The spike fermenter doubles as a brite tank, so I don't have to transfer twice. By question is about dumping the yeast. At least now, by leaving the yeast cake in there, it fills the bottom of the cone so I know I'm getting as much beer as possible. After dumping the yeast, wont some of the beer drop into the cone where the racking arm cant reach, resulting in less beer for packaging? Or will transferring under pressure make this a non issue? Or do I just transfer from the dump valve instead? What do the rest of you do?",Homebrewing

I had a commercial dunkel the other day and noticed that the malty flavor is quite similar to the ""off"" flavor I'd been getting (except the flavor was good in this beer). I think I'm not getting the attenuation I need from liquid yeast, especially since I'm not doing a starter (I know, I know).

I thought it was an oxygen problem, but I changed my racking and kegging procedure to eliminate that - with no change.

Can a tap cause less hop flavor? A few weird occurances.,"Can a tap cause less hop flavor? A few weird occurances. I have brewed a Sabro Pale Ale. I used only Sabro in the beer with total IBU of 30. I used Sabro from 2020 and the following recipe:

https://share.brewfather.app/mLwjUw0ixyyHkz

I kegged it through closed transfer from a Ss Brew Tech Bucket (6 gal). It smelled hoppy and fresh as all heaven when kegging and when letting out co2 and o2 of the keg. The taste was also nice, from the hydrometer sample I poured. The hop is a little bland, but still.

Put it into my tap, whose lines were cleaned with pbw(poured from another keg through tap spout) and rinsed with StarSan. 

Now it has been on the regulator for a week and I poured glasses from it this weekend(after 5 days). There is almost no hop flavor, just a faint tropical aroma. It's on 1 bar. It was dryhopped with 100g from a fresh packet of Sabro in the fermenter on day 3 of fermentation.

Now, here is the freaky part. This exact tap had a NEIPA on it previously. A NEIPA Generously hopped with about 300g of Citra, Mosaic and Idaho 7. This NEIPA also came out pretty bland, and after two months were pretty oxidized. And come to think of it, the Pale Ale before that also came out pretty boring at least from what I was expecting.

Now, here is my question, could the tap lines be the reason? The taps are Intertaps with flow control, and as stated, they have been rinsed frequently. It has 2m of 3/16 tubing. The kegs have been rotated, so it is not the same keg that has housed all three beers...

Any ideas?",Homebrewing

What do you wish you knew before going all grain?,"What do you wish you knew before going all grain? I’ve been extract brewing for a while, and kegging for a year. As a graduation present to myself for finishing my MBA I’ve finally ordered a BrewZilla along with ingredients for a couple of batches. Before I jump in headfirst, what advice would you give or wish you got before you went all grain? 

In terms of setup and process, I’m comfortable in sanitisation, have a fermentation fridge, and keg fridge running dangerously low. 

I’ve ordered the 35L BrewZilla (which includes coil chiller), a hop spider, and a SS mash paddle. I’m planning to test out the setup at least 1 day before brew day to be comfortable with heating elements, pump, and coil chiller. 

After watching some videos (including from u/jcwaffles ) I’ve also decided to grab a BIAB bag to go on the outside of the grain pipe to help avoiding blockages/ issues with the grains. 

I’m planning to heat sparge water with a sous vide in a stock pot. 

For my first couple of batches I’ve ordered milled grains, along with hops, yeast, and adjuncts. One is an all grain kit that I’ll simply follow their instructions, the other is based on a found recipe that I’ve modified for grains readily available in Australia, and recipe added into BrewFather. 

Is there anything I’m forgetting to do? Any equipment I’m missing? Or any advice you can give an all grain noob?",Homebrewing

"Kegging, dry hopping, and cold crashing all for the first time. Any and all advice appreciated!","Kegging, dry hopping, and cold crashing all for the first time. Any and all advice appreciated! I just built a keezer and I’m a relatively inexperienced home brewer. I’m looking for some guidance as I keg my first batch, a NEIPA, as I’m kegging, dry hopping, and wanting to cold crash all for the first time.

Here is my plan -

1. Clean and sanitize the kegs. First with PBW and then with 5 gallons of star sans purged through the system. 
2. Transfer the beer to a keg, which I’m going to use as a secondary fermentor. Here’s my first question: Should I just put the hops in the beer or should I use a hop bomb? If I just put them in there, do I need to cut my dip tube or get a floating dip tube?
3. Pressurize the keg with CO2 at a low PSI (~7 PSI) to prevent oxygenation. 
4. Four days later, close transfer to a sanitized keg and cold crash at 34 degrees for 24 hours
5. Force carbonate the beer at serving temperature 37 degrees by setting the CO2 at 40 PSI for 24 hours
6. Adjust the regulator to serving CO2 level (15 PSI) and enjoy it?

Interim Keezer Build - Thanks for the help,"Interim Keezer Build - Thanks for the help The group was helpful a [few weeks back ](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/iqrc2o/keezer_design_does_your_collar_need_insulation/) when I asked about keezer insulation. I got a whole lot more. Thought I’d share where I’m at.

I had a smaller 41” x 22” freezer and old Johnson Controls A419 controller. This keezer was a series of compromises, but overall I’m pleased. Pic is [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/YVIu8qV)

Choices I made:
  * Sprayed Truck Bed spray paint inside the freezer to seal it. I actually had a small leak inside right away (about 1 gallon of beer leaked from a new line), and it held water tight. It’s worked great.
  *  I decided to go with 2x10” treated lumber construction so I could do a [shelf](https://imgur.com/gallery/E3ruFKm) for 16oz cans and short bottles, and have enough clearance for kegs and fermenters to rest on the “step” above the freezer motor housing. I was warned about the excess height and how it would make it hard to reach the bottom, and that’s true even at 6’2”. 
  * I really wanted to go the [easy load keezer lid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/f69dr1/easy_load_keezer_with_storage/) route, but my freezer lid is pretty flimsy and I don’t think can support any real load. So instead I went the “impossible load” route with a really tall height. :)
  * I used foam board adhesive and HVAC tape to set some rigid 3/4” [insulation ](https://imgur.com/gallery/2xF6a3l)inside of the wood collar. 
  * Chalkboard paint for the lid.
  * Fan and [dehumidifier ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ynp02fw) additions for airflow and condensation issues. The dehumidifier works great - I think I need to reposition the fan.

Still want to:
  * Get short wooden tap handles
  * Figure out how to redo the fan to circulate air up and down more (current set up is half-assed)
  * Mount CO2 canister outside
  * Purchase an extension arm “grabber” for things that fall to the bottom of the keezer.
  * Do a better job of stashing the coil of beverage tubes elsewhere.
  * Other things I can’t think of right now.

FERMENTATION:

Healthy starter of 1318. Pitched at 68, upped to 73 at the tail end of fermentation.

PROCESS NOTES

I did my best to limit oxygen ingress at each step of the process. First dry hop is at the tail end of fermentation, then I did a soft crash to 55 just to drop the hop matter out of solution. After this, I did a semi-closed transfer to a keg with a floating dip tube I use as a ""dry hopping keg"". I do my second charge here, cold crash under pressure, and then closed transfer to the serving keg. Since I moved to using this dry-hopping keg almost like a secondary fermenter I've had minimal hop burn even at high dry hopping rates like this. 

For the competitions, I bottled from the keg into PURGED bottles, filled all the way to the top with essentially no headspace. The ""semi closed"" transfer I mention is siphoning from the fermenter into a completely purged keg via the outpost with a blow-off tube on the in post. I completely purge my kegs by filling them with star san and then pushing it out with CO2. I experimented with pushing the Cl:SO4 ratio here higher than I normally do, in the future I'd drop it back to my normal 170:85 ratio. Otherwise, I was extremely happy with this beer. Going to drop a scoresheet at the bottom of this so you can see what one of the judges said.

FERMENTATION:
Healthy starter of 1318. Pitched at 68, upped to 73 at the tail end of fermentation.

PROCESS NOTES
I did my best to limit oxygen ingress at each step of the process. First dry hop is at the tail end of fermentation, then I did a soft crash to 55 just to drop the hop matter out of solution. After this, I did a semi-closed transfer to a keg with a floating dip tube I use as a ""dry hopping keg"". I do my second charge here, cold crash under pressure, and then closed transfer to the serving keg. Since I moved to using this dry-hopping keg almost like a secondary fermenter I've had minimal hop burn even at high dry hopping rates like this. 

For the competitions, I bottled from the keg into PURGED bottles, filled all the way to the top with essentially no headspace. The ""semi closed"" transfer I mention is siphoning from the fermenter into a completely purged keg via the outpost with a blow-off tube on the in post. I completely purge my kegs by filling them with star san and then pushing it out with CO2. I experimented with pushing the Cl:SO4 ratio here higher than I normally do, in the future I'd drop it back to my normal 170:85 ratio. Otherwise, I was extremely happy with this beer. Going to drop a scoresheet at the bottom of this so you can see what one of the judges said.",Homebrewing
"Palmer's ""Fighting Urak Hai"" barleywine OG at 1.6?","Palmer's ""Fighting Urak Hai"" barleywine OG at 1.6? I have been brewing for two years. Typically at this point I have been doing BIAB successfully, but I wanted to try a barleywine and don't have the capacity to do anything other than extract. So I figured I'd keep it simple and follow the recipe in How To Brew, which calls for 5lbs of malt extract at the beginning, and 7.3lbs at the end. (For a 3 gallon boil).

I ended up with a chilled wort at ONE POINT SIX, targeting 1.01. I didn't notice much boil off, so I'm curious why the OG was so vastly off of what it should have been based on the book.

I was able to dilute it down and I suppose I'm not made because ideally it just means more beer, but does anyone have any thoughts on why the OG was so much higher than expected? Unless I totally misread the recipe...",Homebrewing
Success Cleaning up Acetaldehyde in Helles by Krausening from a new Lager,"Success Cleaning up Acetaldehyde in Helles by Krausening from a new Lager Like the title says, just want to share a success story bringing a lager back from the brink... I had 2 kegs of Helles pick up unmistakable acetaldehyde (green apple) show up a month after going into lager.  Apparently 4 days @ 63 for D-rest wasn't enough to clean everything up.  Both kegs got it so I think it was the result of incomplete fermentation.

Anyway, I held onto this beer for another month (now 9 weeks after kegging/lagering), brewed up 6 gallons of Czech Pils with the Urquell strain, let it become real active, and drew about 1L of beer for each keg.  I let them rest at 62F, sealed under pressure.  After about 5 days, there was noticeable improvement, but I gave them another 7 days just to be really careful.  Kegs went back into the keezer and now they are on draft.  That was in October, and I'm now enjoying a 3-for-the-price-of-1 light lagers.

Simple recipe, I wanted to see what flavour I could get out of exclusively spruce tips in my homebrewing adventure. It's only spruce tips and sugar boiled in for a half hour and left to cool before pitching yeast. Fermentation began in late June. Finished fermenting down to 0.00 SPG late August. The brew was still very hazy. I transferred from fermenter to carbouy and placed in a cold room (10-13°C) hoping the cold would speed the crashing and make a nice clear wine to bottle but no luck. Its been a full month and I have a small amount of sediment on the bottom of the carbouy and a pretty thick looking brew.

I snagged a 6 Tap Micromatic air cooled tower for $200 bucks. The creative juices started flowing even though the beer was not.

I was able to get the keezer built in about 5 days time over a few weekends - I try to let the urethane dry for nearly a week in between coats and sanding. We had some cold weeks and I didn't want to hit it too early.

Some brief stats and equipment that I used:

* Menards house brand Criterion 9.0 cu foot freezer
* Micromatic 6 Tap Stainless Tap Tower (Air Cooled)
* 4 Independently Regulated CO2 manifold (salvaged from old keezer) w/ a new cheap add on 2 way manifold.
* Samsung Tab S 10.5 Tablet from 2012(?) on an articulating tablet mount running a kiosk browser with [Keg.ninja](https://keg.ninja/) as my tap list and volume tracker.
* 3"" 120v recirculation fan (a huge upgrade from my spliced together cpu fans)

I don’t want to approach Porter territory with an excess toasty flavor and associated bitterness. I have 2 questions:

What to brew next..?,"What to brew next..? UK has just gone back into lockdown, want to get a cheeky brew done. Recently I've done an amber ale and a Christmas stout. I want something wintery, I'm a big fan of Belgian dubbels. 

I've also been considering getting a few smaller bottles and doing a BrewDog Hop Shot sort of thing with high ABV and high bitterness. To grow the hairs on the chest, so to speak.

Issue with refractometer,"Issue with refractometer So i finally got a refractometer that was for brewing. And i was wondering, i got my OG from a hydrometer on brew day, converted like normal, etc etc. Came out normal. But i've been using the refractometer to check it since i don't have to open it up or siphon any out, just use a long sterilized pipette. But my FG is coming in waaaay off on the refractometer. Like 1.030 or so. It doesn't taste sweet, or like it's 2% alcohol only. And i calibrated the refractometer using distilled water. 

Am i missing something or am i just a dumbass? I'm gonna keg this weekend anyway and check it against the hydrometer.",Homebrewing
Back in business after a year off,"Back in business after a year off You would think that with everything going on in the world and the extended periods of time at home that this year would have been a great year for home brewing.  Unfortunately, life got in the way and it has taken me until November to brew my first 2020 batch, but homebrew is back on the menu.
I have been brewing on propane for a few years [in my garage](https://i.imgur.com/nw9MLav.jpg) with my biab setup.  After one too many cold New England winters I decided to make the move to electric and bring everything inside.  I picked up an original grainfather 110v off someone local and [dedicated a corner of my basement to brewing.](https://i.imgur.com/Us7l8iW.jpg) The 110v takes some time to get up to temp/boil, but the jacket definitely helps.  I thought about upgrading to grainfather connect controller but I do like the simplicity and functionality of controlling everything manually, curious about what others think about it.   I'll also be controlling fermentation temp for the first time.  My basement is usually around 62F in the winter so I have a fermwrap+inkbird to bump up the temperature when needed, keeping an eye out for a cheap mini fridge to convert.  Overall, should be a good setup for 5 gallon batches.  
Looking forward digging deeper into the science, this sub always has great feedback.  Let's hope 2021 turns out better!

"Revelation about ""green beer""","Revelation about ""green beer"" Bear with me here, these are just some thoughts that may or may not be correct, or maybe its common knowledge, but I figured I would share.

I've been wondering for a while what the hell ""green beer"" or ""young beer"" is.  I'm sure everyone can say after tasting a freshly fermented homebrew from the FG sample that there is a ""green flavor"".   Nobody can seem to accurately describe the taste.  Forum discussions say things like ""it goes away as the beer matures"", or ""the beer mellows out with age"", ""its sharp"", ""don't drink the beer young"", ""be patient"".   I've been searching for a long time about **WHY**?  What is chemically happening to the beer after this time?  If you go down the rabbit hole you will see responses that the yeast is cleaning up after itself, to which I ask ""for months?!"".  This is thought process is especially true for lagers, although that brulospher has his quick lager process that I, and others, agree with.

I gave up on finding the answer to this question, until I started going on a lager kick recently after a five year hiatus.  I never really brewed a great lager before.  I have all the right components, fermentation fridge, ability to get good tasting water, understanding of yeast pitch rates.  I messaged a few lager brewers in my area and got an interesting response from one:

""Get your yeast out after Fermentation. Time, filtration, or fining agents will all work.""

Hmmmm.  I decided to brew a two hop, single malt pilsner, 142F mash for 40 mins, 158F for 20.  34/70, two packs.

After the beer finished fermenting, it smelled great and finished to about 1.010.  I lagered for about a week, with finings.  The beer was still a bit hazy, and I transferred it to the keg.  After carbing I found it still hazy and ""green tasting"", and to be honest not very good. I added more finings and waited two days.  Here's where things got crazy.  As the beer clarified over these two days, the remaining ""green taste"" faded away and I was left with a very nice lager when I had a weird tasting beer before.  I repeated this with a Kolsch and Wyeast 2565.

I am now 100% convinced that there is no need for a long lager, and that as long as you can get the yeast out of your beer you can avoid a green taste.  This is especially true if your beer SMELLS delicious.  Yeast don't have a vapor pressure, and aren't going to appear in the smell.  When people say that a beer is green and that it matures, I'm concluding that it most likely means that the yeast flocculated out of the brew and they are no longer tasting them anymore.  If you want to be even more sure that yeast has a flavor, try some drops of yeast from a liquid yeast package.  Its very bitter and terrible tasting, even if it smells great.  Maybe this only applies to lagers, but I was really blown away on how necessary this step was for me.  From my experience its really not cosmetic.  Give it a try if you feel like your beers still have that ""homebrew"" flavor.",Homebrewing
My 2nd brew,"My 2nd brew During the first lockdown in the UK I started binging Homebrew videos on YouTube and pre-ordered myself a Robobrew 35L. A couple of months later (as I presume everybody else took up home brewing at this time) my dented box arrived but the contents was unharmed. 

For my first brew I did a simple SMASH with Maris Otter and Citra. While that was fermenting I got ‘How to Brew’ aka the bible and binged more videos to create my own recipe for my second brew. I noted everything down from my first attempt at all grain brewing and picked up on potential mistakes (I was about 6pts under the target OG, didn’t sanitise the sieve before pumping out to the fermenting bucket). Today was the day I made the ‘Sand Goby IPA’ (I fish so my beers will be aptly named). 

Recipe:
3.5kg Maris Otter
1kg Munich
0.5kg Caramalt

21L mash water - 72°c strike 65°c mash for 60min to 75°c mash out for 10mins
7L sparge water @75°c

3g each Citra, Mosaic &amp; Simcoe @ 60min boil
6g each @ 15min boil + 1/2 a protofloc
12g each @ 5 min boil
15g each @ 80°c whirlpool for 15mins
20g each for a 3 day dry hop

OG 1.057 - bang on target
19L in the fermenter - 1L under 20L target but I’d rather be under volume than under OG

Estimated 10 day primary @ ambient room temp and further 10 day secondary

No water treatment other than campden tables as my water is quite hard but fed from chalk streams.

Thoroughly looking forward to seeing how this turns out. Although my SMASH wasn’t perfect it still goes down quite well.

Question - Guinness Tap Help,"Question - Guinness Tap Help Hello,

I am looking for some help from all of you who have Guinness on tap in your Keezers and Kegerators. I just built a whole new 8 tap Keezer, which is quite amazing and has been getting lots of use. I use it for many homebrews, a Miller Lite keg, and now the newest addition...Guinness!

The problem for me is every time I pour a pint, I get way too much foam, almost no cascade, and a very sad looking pint.

Stuff you guys should know:

* Keezer temp is 38 degrees
* The beer line is 15'
* The keg was bought 4 days ago, sat in the keezer to acclimate, and then was tapped when I received all the supplies I had ordered. (Yes I picked up the Guinness a little early)
* I am using a 75% Nitrogen 25% CO2 mix
* I tried pouring Pints at 30 PSI, 40 PSI, and 25 PSI with the same effect.

I am kinda stumped at this point. I was hoping for a nice cascading pour and at the 2-minute mark, I have maybe half an inch of beer at the bottom and the rest foam. My primary thought is maybe since the keg sat so long before being tapped it could have messed with the beer's natural CO2 level. But I really have no clue - looking for any kind of help!

Looking forward to hearing from you guys!

3. Do you use electrical tape to attach the fermwrap? It seems like this would be a mess after a couple uses. I use the nylon carry straps sold by vintage shop. Will they melt if I use them to hold it in place?

4. During winter, I'm mostly concerned with heating. However, how do you add a cooling element. That would be nice in the summer months (where I live).

High Gravity Brix Correction,"High Gravity Brix Correction I brewed the Bleu Reserve recipe from AHA a few weeks ago, about 13# of grain, 2# of candi sugar. The original Brix I got was 10%, which struck me as low given the target OG is 1.071, target FG 1.016, target ABV 7.5%. I thought maybe it would show on the back end of the Brix, maybe the Brix would be extremely low after fermentation. My final Brix was 6.6%, leaving me with 3% ABV. It seems impossible, I normally get 75-80% efficiency. Fermentation seemed healthy, 5+ days of nice airlock activity at 63F.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question: Is there some adjustment to be made for high gravity beers? Was my efficiency just terrible for some reason? The only remarkable thing I remember from the brew is I was about 2L short of expected final wort volume I think due to grain uptake, but I can't imagine it affected my efficiency that badly.

2 oz Black Malt

1.35 oz Warrior (17.0% aa) at 60 min

0.9 oz EKG (4.8% aa) at 10 min

Wyeast 1056 fermented at 67 F

My favourite that I typically buy is Oban 14, so something around that price point ideally. But something smokier (Islay) would probably be more appropriate, eh?

What does a recipe with a low FG tell you?,"What does a recipe with a low FG tell you? Hey friends. I've been fumbling around with making my own recipes for a few months now. I've been using the Brewfather app to create these recipes (as well as brew with and track fermentation), and I've been using the included style guides to get close to what it is that I have in mind.

If your not familiar with the app, you can choose a style and the app gives you min and max ranges for things like ABV, color, OG, FG, and IBUs. As you make adjustments to your grain bill, hops, etc. you can watch the effects of your changes and compare them to the selected style and whether or not they fit.

**I've noticed as I play around with this that my estimated final gravities will often be below the recommended levels even though my OG is within the proper range.** I'll then try to increase my grain amounts to get the FG into the proper spot, but then my OG will go way over. Seeing as I can't seem to get my OG and FG into the correct levels *at the same time*, I'm assuming that there is something about their relationship that I don't understand.

Does anyone have any input on what I'm missing? If a beer's final gravity is higher or lower than what's typical of the style, and everything else about the beer is correct, what does that actually do to the flavor?

Imperial stout draft pouring half foam after 4 days in kegerator,"Imperial stout draft pouring half foam after 4 days in kegerator Hello beer friends!

I recently purchased a 2 faucet Kegco kegerator and am currently working through my second 5.5G keg, however I cannot seem to figure out why I cannot get a consistent pour that's not too foamy. I know this happens a lot to new kegerator owners, and I've tried to look up everything I could online first, but nothing I've tried so far seems to totally fix it... so I've resorted to writing up this post.

The beer I have on tap is the Yeti from Great Divide Brewing, which is a 9.5% imperial stout. I also have a keg of kombucha hooked up to my other faucet. I picked up both of the kegs from the liquor store last week Friday at about 7pm. I had a friend visiting me from out of state that night, so I was excited to tap the keg if I could. I've read mixed opinions on whether or not you NEED to let the keg sit over night before tapping, and from what I could gather the only thing that matters is that it's the right temperature (\~38 deg). Needless to say, I decided to tap the keg when I got it home around 7:30pm. Unfortunately I forgot to turn the CO2 on prior to tapping the keg, but I immediately realized I messed up and untapped the keg, turned the CO2 on to \~8psi and retapped the keg. The kombucha tasted flat, and didn't have the punch/vibrancy you'd normally get via the carbonation. The stout also tasted a bit flat and wasn't as cold as I felt it should be. The stout poured very foamy as well.

I realized it probably just needed some time to carbonate and chill, so I turned the CO2 up to 11psi and let the kegs sit for a day. We had some people over the other night and they wanted to try the beer. When they poured the stout, again, it was quite foamy and told them to let it sit and avoid drinking it for now.

The next day, I put a cup of water on the floor of the kegerator to test the liquid temp. I noticed it was \~43 deg (much too hot). I also put a cup of water on the top of the kegerator to test the line temp, and noticed it was \~48 deg. I turned the kegerator down to \~36 and waited some more and repeated the water tests, and managed to get the floor temp to read 38 deg and the line temp to 40 deg.

About 4 days after initially picking up and tapping the kegs, and the kombucha tastes pretty good now though, but the stout still pours about half a glass or so of foam... The kegerator is set to 38 deg and psi is at 12. What else should I do? Anything that looks off to you?

Happy to answer clarifying questions too. I really don't want to continue to waste this delicious beer via foam as it's definitely not cheap!

Is this 'hop burn'? Or off-flavours from the yeast which they haven't cleared up yet?

My thought is that if I cool to 32 and rack, and then lager at 35, the released CO2 from the warm up will push out any oxygen introduced in the transfer.  My fermenting carboy is 6 gal, the one I will use for lagering is 5 gal, so headspace after transferring will be minimal.

Newbie Question - When to bottle? Why is a hydrometer better than watching for bubbles to stop?,"Newbie Question - When to bottle? Why is a hydrometer better than watching for bubbles to stop? Hi All,  I'm relatively new to making beer and I'm excited to learn as much as I can.  I understand that a hydrometer is useful when making beer because it allows one to estimate the alcohol content.  With regard to determining when it's time to bottle a batch, I've read that a hydrometer is superior to simply watching for bubbles to stop forming in the airlock.  I understand \*how\* a hydrometer is used but I don't understand \*why\* it's superior to waiting for bubbles to stop.  

If the wort is still bubbling, isn't that a sign that it's still fermenting and that it isn't ready to bottle?  Is it possible that the wort would be ready to bottle but would still be bubbling?  Is it possible that the wort would stop bubbling but would not be ready to bottle?  If fermentation was just happening very slowly, so that the bubbles weren't obvious, wouldn't the hydrometer readings also be changing so slowly as to not be noticeable?  For what it's worth, I use StarSan in my airlock, so the bubbles are pretty obvious and they stick around quite a while.  I usually clear them once a day when I check the wort.

My setup makes it a little tricky to sample the wort so I'm trying to determine the relative risks - leave it alone until it stops bubbling but risk bottling at the wrong time or risk contamination by sampling every few days.

Free range dry hopping,"Free range dry hopping Hi guys

I have a question / discussion opener regarding dry hopping, especially so called *free range dry hops*.

Before this point, I have been dry hopping using one of those SS capsules where you stick the hops in after kegging, notice that the center is all dry, there is little to no hop aroma in the beer and you want to slice your wrists with a rusty screw driver.

I recently got a bouncer *mac daddy* filter (the larger one) and decided to try my hand at dry hopping by just throwing the hops into the fermenter at approx. 70 %  attenuation, just letting them ride it out for a few days. 

The kegging experience was a nightmare: I was going for a closed loop transfer where beer entering the keg full of CO2 displaces the gas which in turn flows into my fermenter to account for the amount of beer leaving the conical. It was supposed to be a fully oxygen-free transfer, as previously I have found to work perfectly. I had to empty the bouncer filter about 5 times due to there being so much hop debris that the beer would not flow through. This, in turn, caused me to add 5 loads of air into the keg, as after every emptying of the bouncer, it was full of air. Of course the air also flows through my dip tube into the keg, bubbling perfectly through the beer as it tries to find it's way into the gas post.

In the end, I managed to get about 2/3 of the beer into my keg. The rest was just an infernal mush of hops and beer mixed together. I ended up drinking what I could (in panic) and dumping the rest into the sewer, cursing like a mangy sailor. 

I am hoping for any advice regarding *free range dry hopping*; how do you do it? How do you prevent the hops from getting into your keg? How do you manage to drop the hops out of suspension so you can dump them through the dump valve? Do you have any other methods of dry hopping that are superior to the SS capsule bull shit?

Sorry for any parts hard to understand - English is not my first language.

For curiosity's sake, here's my first free range dry hopped IPA. What I managed to get into the keg, tastes like heaven. 95 % Viking Malt Pale Ale, 5 % Viking Malt Wheat. Citra, Amarillo, Centennial. WLP001.

First time brewer and I'm a bit lost. What is the best way to bottle with a pressure barrel? (long),"First time brewer and I'm a bit lost. What is the best way to bottle with a pressure barrel? (long) I have a kit that has a fermentation bucket (with no tap) for the first 1-2 weeks, which is then syphoned into a pressure barrel with the priming sugar for secondary fermentation/carbonation. The thing is I would like to store it in bottles and 2L kegs (referred to as torps) for the sub by Krups. Unfortunately they don't make reusable torps but you can unofficially reuse them.

1) My question is what is the best way to bottle this beer? After fermentation in the barrel? Or completely avoid the barrel and just do the carbonation in the bottle/keg? I have seen it is tricky to bottle beer after carbonation in the pressure barrel as its difficult to avoid introducing oxygen when pouring it, so the beer won't have a long shelf life and it will lose its carbonation.

2) If I am able to fill these bottle/kegs from after carbonation in the barrel, is there an estimated shelf life? (with everything sanitised of course)

If I cannot or should not carbonate in the barrel, and preferably should just bottle it instead, I have another question.

3) Is it ok to syphon into the barrel and mix with the priming sugar, then immediately bottle/keg it? Will there be any risk of killing the yeast in doing this? Will this introduce oxygen or anything that will affect my beer? I ask this because the first bucket does not have a tap. Filling bottles and torps will be much easier from the barrel.

Alternatively I could just add the priming sugar to each keg/bottle.  I can then either syphon the beer into the barrel and then fill each bottle/keg from the tap, or I can syphon directly into the bottle/keg. Is there any advantages with the latter?

Best liquor and/or flavors for a hard seltzer?,"Best liquor and/or flavors for a hard seltzer? I'm not looking to brew my own alcohol. But I do own a keg and a co2 tank for seltzer.

I'm wondering what is the best type of liquor to use if I want to come close to the hard seltzers on the market?

Right now I'm drinking a twelve ounce drink of 30 psi @ 40 degree tap water. I added some drops of sodastream flavor (this is normally just fine on its own) and 1.5oz smirnoffs vodka. I never drink mixers but wow this is *bad*. Then I added 2 grams of sugar, which i think made the drink go flat along with the uncarbonated 1.5oz shot. It tasted barely better, but still, bad.

a.) Would it be much better if I had the liquor, sugar, and flavor all inside the keg first to mix and carbonate along with the water?

b.) maybe i need to try a different brand or type or liquor? I've seen some posts about using rum

Stale/weird beer smell,"Stale/weird beer smell Hey everyone!

I decided to get back into brewing just over a month ago, and revitalized my Brewzilla in order to make a batch of vanilla cream ale. The brewing went smoothly, and the first bottle was amazing - the vanilla was clearly present on the nose, and it tasted super nice. Unfortunately, it was a little undercarbed, so I left the rest in my closet for another week. Now the bottles are perfectly carbed (lacing looks great), but the quality of the beer itself seems to have degraded a little bit.

keg pressure fermenting volume,"keg pressure fermenting volume Hi. I've been interested in pressure fermentation for awhile. Specifically, fermenting and serving in the same vessel with a floating dip tube. I was originally going to get a fermzilla, but that thing's a space hog and would take up my whole mini-fridge, but after learning that 2 corny kegs can fit in a 4.4 cu mini fridge, I decided to go that route so I can actually do more than one at a time. That brought up another concern: volume. I've heard accounts of people brewing 5 gallon batches with fermcap and no problems, but I hear from a lot of people that 4.5 gallons is a better choice.

Just want some anecdotes or wisdom from people with experience. Should I 
1) do a 5 gallon batch and add fermcap?
2) adjust the volume when brewing to end up with 4.5 gallons even though it may change the abv or flavor a bit (does a half a gallon difference change the beer that much?)
3) brew 5 gallons, fill the keg to 4.5 and dump the last half gallon (one blog I read suggested this)?",Homebrewing

Basically, I have only kegged for about 10 years.  I normally set the fermenter on a countertop, wait half an hour, and start the autosiphon (I used to run the tube into the keg lid, but now I connect the siphon tube to the drink post of the keg.

I brewed a winter spiced ale that I'd like to put a couple gallons of into bombers and bottle condition, so I'll need to add priming sugar.  Is the easiest way to use a bottling bucket? I do not have one and don't especially want to buy another bucket for a one-time use, or drill a hole in one I have now.

I have two ideas:

I have a bottle filler for my Intertap taps, basically a racking cane and a bung, but it works OK for the small number of bottles I fill with carbonated beer.  I could put all the flat beer in the keg, and immediately use gas to transfer to primed bottles from the tap.  Would enough yeast get in there to actually condition/carbonate?

I could also prime the keg itself, transfer the whole drink, purge the headspace with CO2 and shake it to mix, then transfer some (primed) beer to bottles, and let the keg condition naturally instead of relying on CO2 to do it.

I pitched a pack of us-05 into a 1.074 OG brew 11 days ago, will package it in three more days.  Temp in my basement is mid-low 60s.

I want to stress test an idea with you. I have limited space for fermenting in my house. The detached garage has not got power and being a rental I don't want to pay for that to be installed so I'm unable to do the standard temp controlled fridge.

A solution that sprang to mind recently is a more polished version of this set up.

https://www.ikegger.com/blogs/ikeggerworld/how-to-temperature-control-your-fermenter-for-under-100

In my adapted version, one of the 4 kegs in my kegerator will always be soda water. The fermenter will be housed in an insulated cupboard sitting next to the kegerator, with a heat source and temp controller installed.

The liquid out line of the soda water keg will be split, one side running to the tap and the other side running through a pump, through a coil in the fermenter and return through an extra post in the lid of the keg. Each line after the split will have a check valve to prevent back pressure. The pump will be powered by temperature controller, flowing cold soda water through the coil and directly chilling the fermenting wort.

Can you provide any advice on whether the plumbing on this would work, and whether the pump etc would still function if the water is carbonated and under pressure? Is there anything you can think of that I would need to consider?",Homebrewing
"A noob brewer who wants to brew a lower alcohol lager for a jolly nice nurse, and is looking for easy-to-read learning resources","A noob brewer who wants to brew a lower alcohol lager for a jolly nice nurse, and is looking for easy-to-read learning resources Hello chaps,

(TL;DR: I'm new, I can brew with a Cooper's kit, but I want to learn how to lower the alcohol)

Thank you for letting me join your Reddit, it's absolutely fascinating!

I'm very new to brewing (although I'm an old hand at fermenting foods and kombucha) and I've started off with a wildling cider, a plain mead, and 25 litres of Cooper's European Lager.

My fiancé loves the taste of the Cooper's lager, and he likes a few bottles when he gets a day off work. He is the reason I took up brewing. We live in a semi-rural part of the north of England (think Winterfell in Game of Thrones), we're in lockdown, and there are sometimes shortages of lager in our local supermarket. When my fiancé gets a day off work the only way to guarantee there's a beer in the fridge for him is to brew it myself (he's working as an NHS nurse and has been treating patients with Covid, so I'm extra keen to do this for him after he's worked so hard).

The trouble is that I think this lager is a lot stronger than the kind we would usually buy, and I'd like to know how to tweak the recipe to lower the alcohol content. It doesn't need to be zero alcohol, I just want to understand what I'm creating with this kit, and how to make it with the minimum possible alcohol content, rather than the maximum possible alcohol content.

Can you recommend some easy to understand (for a noob) articles on the science of brewing in relation to lowering alcohol content? Do I just add less of the hopped malt extract? Or less of the yeast?

Things I have to consider:
• my fiancé doesn't like real ale, or anything too hoppy. He likes German lager but will not drink anything more interesting (I will, though!)
• I can't get any more kit because I've filled the kitchen to capacity
• any new ingredients need to be easily obtainable via post

Kit I have at home:
• 25 litre fermenting bin with air lock and tap (x2)
• 5 litre demijohn with airlock (x4)
• multimeter in Polish
• sanitizer, brewing sugar, carbonation drops, Cooper's Brew Enhancer ""Number 2"", yeast nutrient (for the mead)
• 250ml glass bottles with caps and capper (loads!)
• a brewing space at a consistent 20 degrees Celsius

What do you think? Is it possible for me to science the sh*t out of this, but to do so with baby steps where I learn as I go along, rather than jumping in at the deep end of all-grain boiling mash hopping hardcore brew-mastery? All advice gratefully received, especially directions to good learning resources.

Many thanks!

P.S. my Biowin multimeter says ""green"". This is not the specific gravity measurement I was looking for. Does the multimeter give an SG reading if I convert the colour to numbers somehow, or do I need to ditch it and order a hydrometer?",Homebrewing

I love notetaking, but have garbage handwriting and am a bit obsessed with neat notes. None of the online brew note websites or apps have scratched that itch, there's always too many fields left blank or not the right field for the data. So I made a simple one on excel. Was good learning also. 

Alcohol, apparent attenuation, IBUs (even have a utilization function in that one, it's a long formula haha), grain weight and percentages of grain bill are all tied to a formula. The only thing I haven't done yet is the og/fg calculator side of things. Easy to do formula-wise, but you have to either look up and type in the PPG of each grain, OR import a massive list like brewers friend already does.. So I still just use brewers friend. 

I'm considering eventually adding a simplified version of it.. and just having ""pilsner malt"" and then link a general PPG to it regardless of the brand, and just do that for most of the malts I use even somewhat regularly. But that's for another day, when I'm bored at work or something.

The only differences I perceive is Guinness has a little better head retention and a slightly sweeter taste. How can I modify the recipe to get get this closer? Beersmith estimated FG to be 1.010 and I finished at 1.012 so I wouldn't think that caused it to be less sweet than expected.

StarSan got in beer during secondary fermentation - should I toss the batch?,"StarSan got in beer during secondary fermentation - should I toss the batch? Hi all, I wanted to get the advice of some fellow beer brewers who may have run into a similar situation. Due to some clumsiness on my part, I ended up with about 2 cups of StarSan solution (diluted to it's appropriate concentration for sanitizing) in a 5 gallon batch of a porter I'm making while transferring it into a secondary fermenter. I ended up moving it into secondary anyway, but I'm wondering if anyone knows if the brew is still safe to drink?

Verdant vs east coast side by side,"Verdant vs east coast side by side Full disclosure I tried to post about this yesterday, but had to delete the post after my brew partner had a good laugh. The taps were switched. Turns out I compared two totally different beers. 

Now we are doing this properly. 

9gallon split batch of neipa

OG 1.068
Verdant FG 1.016
East coast FG 1.013

75% 2 row
15% wheat malt
10% flaked oats 

Bitter to 15 ibus 

Citra/azacca 50/50 at a rate of 1oz total hops per gallon in the whirlpool, and 1oz total hops per gallon dry hop

Both beers were Fermented @65°,  in corny kegs with a blow off for the first 72 hours, at which point they received one large dry hop addition, blow offs were pulled, floating dip tubes attached, and enough pressure was applied to seat lids. The kegs were left for a week to finish up, and aggressively cold crashed for 3 days before a sample

Hard to tell in the photo, but the beers look quite similar. The east coast is slightly less opaque, and seems to hold its head better, but I will say there is a possibility of slightly different carbonation levels just due to the natural carb starting up at possibly different points in the time line.

Smell: 

-east coast smells very punchy, lots of peach and mango, little bit of dry citrus. Seems to sit heavy in your nose, but comes in distinct waves

-verdant smells of mostly of apricot and citrus, with that almost vanilla yogurt thing happening. However the scent is more of a mix of things, rather than several distinct different flavors it almost has a fruit salad or smoothie thing going on. 

Taste:

-east coast tastes peachy, ripe mango, little herbal, and some grapefruit thing seems to happen at the end. Has a sweetness about it

-verdant tastes mostly mango, some pineapple, and Some stone fruit, once again with that little twinge of vanilla yogurt. Seems less sweet despite higher FG

Mouth feel:

-east coast feels pretty thick and silky, and has a coating bitterness that sticks around. Very round feeling. Perhaps a touch oily

-verdant also nice and thick and silky mouth feel. Seems a little bit lighter and brighter. Still quite round, and also with some bitterness that sticks around. No oily feel

Honestly they are both quite good. If you like a more balanced and drinkable neipa I would go with verdant. If you are looking for something a little more aggressive I would go with east coast. As is my usual experience with London iii based strains, it tends to blend everything together well. I usually find that Conan type strains are more aggressive and push individual aromas and flavors. 

Over all pleased with both.

Kveik Cider Recipe,"Kveik Cider Recipe Was having a hard time finding information about using Hothead kveik in cider. So i gave it a shot. Definitely not a ground breaking recipes, but here it is. Apple juice is from Costco.

Kveik cider
- 2 gallons of kirkland apple juice (be sure it has no preservatives)
- 3 cinnamon sticks
-Half cup of white granulated sugar 
-quarter cup of brown sugar
- yeast nutrients (follow package instructions)
- pectic enzyme for clarity (follow package instructions)
- omega hothead yeast (half packet)

Mix all of the ingredients together in your fermenter then pitch the yeast.

Starting gravity should be around 1.068

Kviek likes it hot, so I use a heating pad and an inkbird to keep the temperature around 80ish. Was shooting for 85 but it hovered at 83 for most of the fermentation. Took about a week. [fermenting kveik cider](https://imgur.com/gallery/W1NTTr2)

Final og of around 1.004

I then add a campden tablet and back sweeten the cider. This is to taste, but I used 1 can of apple juice concentrate.

Keg Fermentation: I make stupid mistakes so you don't have to.,"Keg Fermentation: I make stupid mistakes so you don't have to. I got a 2.5 gallon keg to play around with fermentation in a keg, no chill, and pressure fermentation. I'm only 5 months into this hobby, so everything is still new. I have to take each step slowly and deliberately as I get the process down. Now, I've gotten about 10 brew days under my belt and feeling that I am starting to get the hang of things. 

Yesterday morning, I try an ESB and get it in my keg to chill by noon. Later that evening, after a few beers, I check the keg and it is cool enough to pitch yeast. I still haven't worked with spunding valves enough, so I hook up a blow off tube instead. It worked well on the last batch to hook up a blow off and then switch to a spunding valve after a day or two.

Now, when I first got a keg, I did make a mental note that I should label these posts ""gas"" and ""beer"", but I never followed through. In my late night fog, I looked at the out valve and thought, ""Hey, blowoff pushes gas ""out,"" so I need to connect to the out post.""

The first thing I check this morning is if activity has started, and I go into the garage to check. As I stare at a full blowoff jug full and a puddle on the floor my first thought is ""that is a really active fermentation."" Then slow realization set in. I am replacing all my beer in the keg with Co2. Fortunately, I was using a 1 gallon jug for blowoff, so the mess wan't too bad. Unfortunately, I just lost a gallon plus on a 2.5 gallon brew.

TL;DR: Know which post your dip tube is on.

Third mistake: Allow the wife control the thermostat, it's never above 60\* in our house (menopause is a b\*tch) and the fermenter was left in the concrete basement next to the furnace for a week and then siphoned to a carboy for clearing and stored in the upstairs closet next to the server (figure the heat from the server would help) for another 2 weeks and a few extra days while I tried to find some bottles.

My plan was to mash thursday, do what I needed to Friday and then boil and pitch Saturday night. I figured there was a small chance that there be an infection, but that the beers already gonna have old malt, what harm is there in having it be funky too? 

I was right.

SS Brewtech 14gal Unitank,"SS Brewtech 14gal Unitank Hi all, UK based if that helps at all, I am thinking of purchasing one of the above. As I understand it, there are quire few extras that are needed to make it live up to its potential!

I will need the FTSS² as I don't have a fridge or freezer large enough for it. I own a Maxi 310 Chiller so plan to use that for the cooling side. Will have to somehow rig that to work with the FTSS² controller.

I will buy the spunding valve for pressurising the beer towards the end of fermentation.

I will need a 3""CIP ball for cleaning - plus some tubing, an elbow and TC barbs to connect the CIP, the bottom port and my pump.

I will need some kind of connector for the blowoff ball valve as it just ends on a 1/2"" female NPT port as far as I can tell.

I'll need a 1.5"" TC to barb for the transfer port.

I'll need a 1.5"" TC to something connector on the trub dump port to dump the trub...

Is there anything i'm forgetting or am I overthinking all this?

Also the spunding valve setup and FTSS² kit are both out of stock on the Malt Miller site... starting to think I might just not bother! Have I just talked myself out of this?",Homebrewing
Using glass beverage dispenser as cask/firkin?,"Using glass beverage dispenser as cask/firkin? I currently have a Burton/Old Ale finishing primary in a 5L glass beverage dispenser, similar to [this one](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gibson-Home-Bayfront-Summer-2-6-Qt-Glass-Drink-Dispenser-for-Cold-Drinks-985112060M/310646975), kind of like a quasi-open fermentor (seal removed and wire lock not engaged, so the lid is held in place by gravity)  


Seems to be working well, so now I am wondering if I could use it for cask ageing (and later, dispensing) the same, as well. The dispenser is obviously not pressure rated, but the glass is thick and I've replaced the original plastic spigot with a proper stainless one. The style calls for low pressure (I've seen as low as 1.0 atm cited) so it shouldn't create too much strain.  


Can I just prime, seal the lid, and let it sit a couple of months (probably inside a cooler to contain any mishaps)? Would I need to open the lid during serving to manage headspace?  


I am also thinking about adding some toasted oak staves, which I already have from cocktail aging projects, to simulate the wood of a traditional firkin.",Homebrewing
Verdant yeast vs. east coast,"Verdant yeast vs. east coast So I am now on my second brew with lalbrew verdant, and decided to split the batch and also try lalbrew east coast.

Made 9 gallons of wort, and split it into two seperate corny kegs, pitched verdant in one and east coast in the other. Fermented at 68°f. Dry hop 72 hours in, and attached floating dip tubes to serve out of same keg. 

Now that they have been sitting for about a week I pulled my first pint of each.

Both batches 1.068
Verdant FG 1.016
East coast FG 1.014

75% 2 row
15% wheat malt
10% flaked oats

Bittered to 15 ibus

Even split of Citra and azacca in both the whirlpool and dry hop at a rate of 1oz/gallon 

So far, the verdant is significantly darker than the east coast, and it has more dank aroma. Getting a lot more herb and pine with some fruit n the background. Almost more like a fruity west coast. Also very viscus. 

The east coast is way waaaaaay lighter, way more citrus, pineapple, and peach vibes, lighter mouth feel. More traditional to a neipa style. Lighter mouth feel.

Both of these beers were fermented in kegs with blow off tubes for 72 hours before dry hopping, sealing and oxygen purging. Left to sit for a week, then tipped up with CO2 and put into the fridge to cold crash.

Here are the [two beers](http://imgur.com/gallery/yfQiEdT)

NEIPA astringency makes me sad,"NEIPA astringency makes me sad Hi chaps,

I am distraught. I finally decided to brew my first NEIPA and used the Average NE IPA recipe everyone gave good feedback on (https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/363082/avg-perfect-northeast-ipa-neipa-). I got galaxy and honey malt from a different country, set water chem and mash temps well. Didnt pitch too hot for once. I thought I did everything well, but this came out my worst batch so far. What I did was pressure ferment after 72hrs and dry hopped both charges at once at 72hrs. I tasted a sample on day 4 and unsurpsingly it was bitter and horrid. I coldcrashed day 8 and kegged day 9. It is now 1 week after kegging and while the astringency has decresed, it is still acrid. 

  I get a nice sweet aromatic hit up front but rapidly turns to discusting bitterness at the back of the mouth. Can I salvage this? I will give it one more week in the keg and if not improved will fine with geletine. So bleak about this as it has been the style I have most been looking forward to when I started brewing 5 months ago. I love this hobby and will not give up

Pitch possibly dead yeast with new?,"Pitch possibly dead yeast with new? I purchased the Hop Monster IPA kit from NB this summer at the end of July. I added on their recommended yeast packs for it. When my order arrived I open the box grab up the one loose brown envelop saying refrigerate immediately and placed it in the fridge.

"RIS aging hack, at least potentially","RIS aging hack, at least potentially Disclaimer: based on a sample size of 1

Made my batch of RIS (see recipe at the end of the post) slightly oversized so that I could bottle a few.  The last bottle got only half-filled.  Since I used my normal bottle-a-few procedure of measuring sugar individually into bottles, that bottle had the ~right amount of sugar to carbonate properly.  I decided to cap it so that I could check if carbonation was happening -- never know when you push US-05 past 11% -- without having to waste a full bottle.  Didn't purge the bottle with CO2, because I was just planning to use it to check carbonation and pour it down the drain if it was oxidized.

A week later I opened the bottle and first of all it was fully carbonated (go US-05!).  What was even more surprising is how ready it tasted.  The roast from packaging day was hugely subdued, and there was ample raspberry, chocolate and vanilla.  It was a great beer!  So, two days later I opened a full bottle, and while it also was carbonated, it reminded me of the raw bottling day sample and was nothing like the half-filled bottle.

My hypothesis is that oxidation super-accelerated the aging, and due to sufficient roast etc. the RIS was able to stand up to it.  Does anyone else have experiences with half-filled RIS bottles, or care to otherwise postulate what caused the half-full bottle to mature in a week?

Storing homebrew in keg/torp for the sub by Krups,"Storing homebrew in keg/torp for the sub by Krups Recently got the sub as a birthday present and I got a homebrew kit last year which I have yet to use. I really want to store my own brew in the kegs to use in the sub. It would be a great way to store it and refrigerate it. 

Only issue is krups don't make reusable kegs/torps for the machine. I don't know whether this is a health and safety issue or its just monetisation, but its probably the latter. But, I have seen people finding out ways to make these torps reusable. It involves cleaning the attachment hose, pump air into the torp to inflate the collapsed inner bag and just seal in again with the attachment hose. This method seems fine if you're just filling it up, chilling and using it. But I am unsure how safe it is for storing. 

If I am to do this I know I will need to disinfect the torp before filling them up. And it will need to be chemically disinfected as the torps are plastic.

BIAB expected efficiency problem. Been on my mind and fleeting in and out of understanding for a year or so now. I think I finally have it figured out.,"BIAB expected efficiency problem. Been on my mind and fleeting in and out of understanding for a year or so now. I think I finally have it figured out. When I use [Brewers Friend All grain OG/FG calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/allgrain-ogfg/) for BIAB to estimate my efficiencies, I Always have trouble getting the pre boil and post boil to match up. 

The variables are:

grain bill, pre-boil volume, post-boil volume, efficiency

If I put my full volume (lets say I fill my kettle to 30L at the start of my brewday) into the calculator, then the calculator correctly estimates my mash. Take this much water, add this much grain, at this %efficiency, and you get the right number. Easy. 

Now, in order to get the correct post-boil gravity, I would have to factor in the amount of both LIQUID and SUGAR lost when I pull my grain. The calculator only accounts for liquid lost. There's no way to account for the loss of sugar in the wort when I pull my grain bag. 

SO... the problem is if I enter my preboil volume to match the volume after I have pulled my grain (say 27L, to carry on with the example before) then the calculator just over-calculates my pre-boil OG, and thus my post-boil OG. If I leave the full volume as the preboil (30L) and then just go with it and enter my post boil (24L) then it calculates a huge boil off and my pre boil gravity is correct and my post boil gravity is way over what it truly should be. 

SOLUTION: use the OG/FG calculator for only my full volume pre-boil OG. Then take that number to this [Dilution and Boiloff calculator](https://www.brewersfriend.com/dilution-and-boiloff-gravity-calculator/), where I can enter my pre-boil OG, my \*true\* pre boil volume (27L, after loss to grain absorption), and my target volume after my 60 minute boil. 

But in reality I'm just going to start recording and referring to full volume pre-boil gravity alone for efficiency marks. I'll still record my actual pre-boil, post- boil, and FG. But for recipe planning and to make sure I'm hitting my numbers during brewday, I'll only be using the pre-boil gravity from this calculator.

I usually chill the keg down using a bucket of ice, and carb using a real CO2 bottle and the rocking/shake method.  Then I put in the fridge I use a tap handle that connects directly to the out post to dispense(party keg style), with a 16 gram C02 cartridge on the in post.

I have been getting heavy foam(about half a pilsner glass) off  the keg, which is usually at its worst when the keg is full, and decreases to perfection around the last few pours.  The beer itself is lightly carbonated when the foam goes down.

I have mostly been attributing this to the keg being too warm and not absorbing the CO2, but I always see posts on this forum recommending 10-12 feet of hose length in a kegorator type set-up.  Of course my hose length is effectively zero.  Is this my issue?

Crisp lager without temp control,"Crisp lager without temp control Hi,

I want to ferment a lagerlike beer with a perceivable but not IPAesque hop character. So a sizeable flameout addition of 2,1% tettnang will be made.

 I will decoction mash a grainbill of 100% pilsner malt. Does 56C for 15 mins then 66C for 45minutes sound good? The target is 4-5% abv.

1. what yeast to use? My room temperature is 19-20C. Right now im debating the following: saflager 37/70, Voss kveik, or buying some Oslo kveik.

2. What water profile to use? Again, the target is a crisp beer and i can adjust the pH with lactic acid. My tap water is the following:

I want to start bottling a portion of my beer so that I can sample my previous brews long after the keg is tapped and keep a diverse selection beyond my 1-2 kegs on tap. I'm force carbing the keg but I'm going to condition the bottles.

Before, when I would bottle a whole batch, I would bring some dextrose water to a boil to sanitize the priming sugar before racking to a bottling bucket. Now I want to try priming each bottle separately since I'm only bottling a small portion.

Unfortunately I didn't have the forethought to buy carb drops or dextrose from my LHBS and with all that's going on this weekend, I don't think I'll have time to stop by. My closest LHBS is unfortunately 45 mins away and they've gone to curbside pickup only with the year's current events which adds another layer of logistics, it's just not likely in the cards.

That brings me to regular table sugar from the wife's baking supplies. Do I need to worry at all about sanitizing the sugar before bottling? This is going to be a well used bag of sugar that's seen its share of time on the counter. I've read some people simply put 1 tsp. of table sugar into the bottle when racking. Are there any other methods I could use? Looking for any advice, and if you think I should skip this batch for when I'm better prepared, I'm all for it. Thanks!",Homebrewing

Currently just looking for feedback from anyone who has used or has experience moving from cooler mashtun brewing to electric systems. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- 10 Gal Blichmann BrewEasy

Seems like one of the best quality ""all in one"" systems out there. I typically brew 5 gal batches but I do not like the fact that the 5 gal setup has a smaller mashtun than what I currently utilize (7.5 gal vs 10 gal cooler). I like having the ability of brewing a 10 gal batch or a 5 gal batch especially at this higher price point.

\- RIMS system utilizing my current Spike Boil Kettle

Probably utilize a the RIM Rocket from Blichmann for this. It would require me to have at least 2 240 outlets run to the brew area. This system obviously would take up more space, and have more parts to clean. But the thing I like about the Spike kettles is the welded bulkheads, which Blichmann kettles lack. For almost the same cost I would come up with a full 3 kettle brew system.

I have a 240V Grainfather that I purchased and used while overseas, but now I am in the US. I've read a few options ranging from:

1. Getting a heatstick &amp; jacket to make up for the lost power
2. wiring a GFCI outlet into the dryer/washer outlet or breaker
3. some janky wiring of two 120V outlets into one plug (not looking to do this... just saw it around)
4. getting a beefy (5000W?) transformer to step up a 120V outlet to 240V

I'm not an electrician and don't really feel like its worth hiring someone with doing number 2 or 3, especially as I'm renting. 

Will a transformer do the job?   
Will I be able to get a rolling boil if I just plug into a 110V outlet? 

I don't mind if things are a little slower, but I'm worried about if it'll get to rolling at all... If a transformer is the ""budget"" fix to this without doing any electrical work, that'd be great.

FWIW - I like to brew outside to minimize condensation and all that inside, so I'll need to run an extension cord.

SG -&gt; Maltose/Dextrin ratio?!,"SG -&gt; Maltose/Dextrin ratio?! I've just recently started homebrewing and have a question that I can't crack myself:

So my understanding is that the measured SG tells how much sugar is in our wort, i. e. how much starch has gotten converted into Maltose/Dextrin.

Now here's what got me puzzled: how is it possible to predict the final gravity of the beer after fermentation (as tools out there do) when we can't actually know how much of that total sugar is Maltose (i. e. fermentable by the pitched yeast) and how much of that is Dextrin (i. e. non-fermentable). 

I am thinking that as the Dextrin doesn't get fermented, the amount of Dextrin in the total SG should remain unchanged during the fermentation phase while the Maltose does get fermented effectively causing the SG to drop.

Obviously I'm off here somehow and I'd really appreciate if someone more experienced/knowledgeable would shed some light on this.

10,80 kg of Malt Pale (2 Rangs) UK

 3,00 kg of Malt Pâle, Maris Otter

 2,10 kg of carmunch typ 1

 2,00 kg of Caramunch II 

 1,50 kg of Oats, Flaked 

 1,30 kg of Carafa special I

 0,35 kg of Carafa III

 1,20 kg of Milk Sugar (Lactose) \[Boil\] 

&amp;#x200B;

mash for 75 min @ \~69°C with 60L water and 15 min mash out.

sparge 51.6 L water at 75°C

Estimated O.G: 1.066

Measured O.G : 1.048 to 1.054 

&amp;#x200B;

I brew in 100L kettles and manage usually to maintain the mash temp (even though it's not always homogenous throughout the mash volume.

&amp;#x200B;

I mill my own grain but usually reach the desired O.G. for other recipe.

What do your brewday notes look like?,"What do your brewday notes look like? I use Brewfather almost always. But at times, I do like the romantic feel of jotting on a notepad to capture a gravity sample, a hop addition, etc. I find these interesting to look at when reflecting on brewdays and recipes. That being said, I'm not happy with how my note taking ""flows"" throughout the process and I'd benefit from seeing how others are structuring their notes. I'm curious what your notes look like when you go analog. Here's mine from yesterday.

Sanitizing Apple Wood Chunk before long Hot Sauce pepper mash fermentation,"Sanitizing Apple Wood Chunk before long Hot Sauce pepper mash fermentation Looking to do a 3+ month chili pepper fermentation and have Apple wood chunks for smoking. 

Saw previous posts about soak in whiskey/bourbon for 3 weeks and also an 8 year old post about steaming for 15 minutes, but not trying to add another flavor to this fermentation and also not trying to add water to this mash. 

1. How would you recommend Sanitizing these wood chunks before a long food fermentation without liquor or steam?

2. Or would you recommend steaming and just using a brine instead of a mash?

3. Lastly, think I should bust these chunks into wood chips before the ferment? I'm concerned that more wood chips and more surface area might mean more chances for splinters to get into the peppers, whereas the chunks as they are, are pretty rounded and the sides aren't splintered.",Homebrewing

"2 month update on the 16% ABV stout, plus what's going in the barrel next!","2 month update on the 16% ABV stout, plus what's going in the barrel next! My monsterous stout has been in the barrel for over two months. I sent a sample to a lab for fun, and it came back at [15.73% ABV](https://imgur.com/a/KOHGdTl), which is about what I estimated since I was topping off with lower abv stout during aging. It'll probably drop down to 15.6% by the time I bottle.

I've had several small tastings from the nail just to track progress. It's damn good. Medium-full bodied, boozy brownies, loads of chocolate, dark coffee, some toasty vanillins, a bit of raisin, and a great bourbon background. The best part is that even drinking flat and warm at this ridiculous ABV and young age, it is totally delicious and not hot. Sure, it's got alcohol warmth, but I detect only miniscule higher alcohol heat, which I'm pretty sensitive to.

Don't let the 1.022 FG fool you, it still has plenty of sweetness. This is because of the difference between apparent and real attenuation which is really showcased in a super high ABV beer.

Honestly though, I think it lacks what makes a RIS a RIS, so I won't be calling it that anymore. It isn't roasty enough, and the sweetness really cuts down the relatively low roast. It also isn't as astringent as I feel it should be.

If I did this again, I would consider doubling the roast barley and mashing higher for more dextrins while drying it out with dextrose since it is pretty damn sweet. Going for same body, less sweetness with much more roast.

Overall, a great high ABV desert stout. Again, not really a RIS.

Keg won’t carbonate,"Keg won’t carbonate I always burst carbonate my beers by hitting them at 36 psi for 36 hours. It always results in well-carbed beer until right now. 

I made my annual pumpkin wee heavy and I’ve now done 1 round of my normal burst method followed by 2 rounds of 30 psi for 24 hours. For whatever reason the beer is pouring with low carbonation and next to no head. 

I’m baffled because my keg seems to be working properly with no leaks. The only option I can think of is that my regulator is broken. However, I’m skeptical of this because I set it to my normal serving pressure of 12 psi and it flows like normal, not like it would at a significantly lower pressure.

Dry hopping dark beer after aging,"Dry hopping dark beer after aging Hi All,

I have a hoppy dark ale that I have been brewing for a few years now and I really enjoy. I usually stays on tap for about 4 months or so, being quite strong I don't drink a heap in one sitting. I find that the flavour changes a lot over the time I have it on tap. At the start, it has a great hop flavour/aroma. This fades over time, but then I find that by the end of the keg the beer keeps tasting better and better, well past when the hops has faded. 

I was thinking for the next time I brew this beer it might be a good idea to age it first for 3 months or so, then dryhop, hoping to get the best of both worlds. 

Is this a good idea or a dumb idea?

0.4 oz Magnum hops (25 IBU)

2L starter of Escarpment Isar lager yeast. crashed and decanted

Water profile was yellow malty. 90 minute mash at 148F. All hops at 60 minutes to get a smooth bitterness. Dextrose added at the end of the boil along with 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient.

Then COVID hit. No freezers or fridges ANYWHERE.  

I finally found a chest freezer at Lowe’s and pulled the trigger. Took me a few weeks because reasons (used it for a ferm chamber, extra parts, gf needed me to take her out of town two consecutive weekends, etc.) but it’s finally done! Just need to pull together a draft line cleaning system and I’ll be serving my freshly brewed beers! [Here it is in all it’s glory. ](https://imgur.com/a/LEsTTl6) I plan to paint the freezer and stain the wood at a later date but I wanted it finished.",Homebrewing
Most recent hop crop,"Most recent hop crop Hey folks,

Just wanted to start up a thread so we can all share our experiences with the most recent crops of hops. If y'all have some input and notes from a fresh bag please share.

So far for 2020:

Citra - way more green and catty to me, way more herbal, way less citrus. Not impressed

El Dorado - pineapple bomb, candied fruit, sweet, oily. Awesome

Azacca - less flavor (?) Than previous years but more burn. Some tropical, some pine, but mostly hot. Meh

Galaxy - way less passion fruit and mago, little more pine apple, but herbal AF. Like, almost dill or thyme or something. It's almost like someone has mixed the usual fruit bomb with a super noble hop. Not thrilled

If anyone has so input on belma, Nelson and Vic secret for most recent crops it would be of special interest to me. 

All input is encouraged.",Homebrewing

Bottling Tepache,"Bottling Tepache Hello brewers, 

a couple days ago someone posted about tepache being a homebrew, so i decided to make some at home. Made a 1 Gallon batch (in a carlo rossi wine), made with authentic piloncillo. 

    -------------------- 
    1 Gallon Batch
    -------------------- 
    Recipe:
    -------------------- 
    - 1 gallon RO water
    - 3 cones of piloncillo (225 grams ea)
    - the skin of 1 pineapple, center and some pulp
    - 1 habanero
    - 1 cinammon stick
    - 1 oz peepled and cubed ginger
    - the juice of one lemon
    - 7 oz organic tamarind pulp
    -------------------- 

I used the yeast from the pineapple's skin and pitched a little of voss slurry I had from a blonde ale I made a couple months back, it took off in half an hour.

I did not take an OG reading because I had no hydrometer but I am guessing the liquid is at least 1.075.

I want to naturally carbonate this. When should it be a good time for this? Prime as usual? Do I have to age this?

Thanks in adavance, cheers.",Homebrewing
Wiring a spa panel for ebiab gfi,"Wiring a spa panel for ebiab gfi I've been all over HBT and elsewhere trying to get my head around wiring a spa panel, but the posts I've found that have detailed wiring diagrams etc don't quite match my situation. I'm plugging into a NEMA 14-30 outlet for my dryer, and my controller plugs into the same kind of outlet. Almost all of the diagrams etc I've seen are folks trying to work with 3 wire setups. Anyone have a pointer to a post, diagram, video, etc? Trying not to kill myself and I'm pretty new to all this.",Homebrewing
What can I ferment at 60-65°F?,"What can I ferment at 60-65°F? The basement in the spot i just moved to stays a pretty steady 60-65°F, wondering what styles would work best around these temps? Relatively new so simple is good, thanks so much!",Homebrewing
Does a decoction mash with wheat leave a bread-crust flavor?,"Does a decoction mash with wheat leave a bread-crust flavor? I tasted a beer with a high amount of unmalted wheat in it, and it had a bread-crust type flavor that was fairly unique, and I was not very fond of it. I don't recall the brewery, but I do recall it was from Europe so I assumed decoction was on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware decoction produces melanoidins. This is what I'd like to obtain. I'm also aware that a good deal of starch is left unconverted if it's not malted before the mash, even with an appropriate diastatic power. This is what I worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask because I wanted to try a decoction mash as an experiment, but my go-to experiment recipe uses a large amount of unmodified wheat, and if I won't like it, it'll change how I run my experiment.",Homebrewing
